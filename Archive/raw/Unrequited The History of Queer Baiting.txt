the queer Community has become incredibly good at finding queer subtext in movies and TV shows whether it exists or not for over a century of film and
television we've probably been the most underrepresented minority in media it was never illegal for a character of
color to exist in a movie but it was illegal for a long time for a
queer character to exist writers directors and producers could be taken to court under obscenity laws fined and
even jailed for having the nerve to show a queer character at the same time it's become a culturally agreed upon fact
among CIS straight people to the point of parody that the queer Community runs Hollywood The Velvet or Pink Mafia
supposedly now run by David geffin is even an assumed queer media cartel that inserts l LGBT messaging into movies and
TV shows to corrupt the youth of America the funny thing is this isn't entirely
false I mean we're not trying to corrupt the youth of America growing up alone in the suburbs is doing a fine job of that
all on its own but there has always been a loose Collective of queer creators that do insert coding into a lot of
movies TV shows and books coding that would likely be ignored by Straight audiences but immediately recognized by
those of us who are on the lookout it's reached a bit of a fever pitch late with Po and Finn Steven Bucky Teen Wolf the
legend of Kora and even Frozen but just because people outside queer spaces are finally recognizing it doesn't mean it's
a new thing what we now call Queer baiting has been around since the early days of Cinema sort of film historians
have given the early days of this phenomenon the name queer coding which a lot of people confuse
with queer baiting but there is a big difference between the two queer coding
is when you're unable to show actual queer characters on screen either because of the laws or morals of the day
or because Studio Executives just won't let you so you create characters that the Right audience will obviously view
as gay lesbian by or transgender to allow for LGBT representation when the entire world is telling you not to a
little Golden Nugget hidden deep underground for the people who are willing to dig for it while queer
baiting is when you do have the ability to add queer characters to your film or TV show but just don't want to risk
turning off certain audiences or advertisers by doing so one is an effort to give LGBT audiences at least a taste
of representation while the other is used to real inad audience with an implied promise of queer characters
without ever actually intending on fulfilling that promise it's like the Cinematic
equivalent of edging without the money shot so let's look at the history of this practice discover media you may not
know is intended to be read as queer see when the line between queer coding and queer B began to blur and why we still
don't have an out LGBT superhero in the
History of Queer Baiting
MCU your ideas about who you are don't just come from inside you they come from the culture and in this culture they
come especially from the movies so we learn from the movies what it means to be a man or a woman what it means to
have sexuality Richard dryer film historian a long time ago in a Hollywood
Far Far Away gay characters were not all that uncommon but they were played for
Laughs in the early days of silent film movies like a Florida enchantment algae
the minor and the soilers featured gay characters as easy comic relief the idea
of homosexuality was even a gag in behind the screen an early Charlie Chaplain film that showed him kissing a tomboy and being mocked for it being
mocked by someone whose eye makeup could make Trixie Mattel blush it was around this time that that the [ __ ] stereotype
was born flouncy bouncy frilly men with creative jobs artists designers this
grew out of the self-hatred among straight men who found it hard to provide for their families in lean times
you weren't a man if you couldn't support a wife and three kids you weren't a man if you couldn't go off to war so to appeal to the egos of these
quote unquote real men producers created characters to make them feel better about their masculinity movies like our
betters the Broadway Melody meron merge and Call Her Savage were just a few
films with such characters this type of representation of gay men was not appreciated well always a
joke there's no sin like being a woman wear a man dresses as a woman the
audience laughs when a woman dresses as a man nobody laughs this wasn't the only
representation though the 1927 film Wings featured
a a very intense friendship between two pilots that culminates in
this
Queen Christina
scene but scenes like that were few and far between so while gay men were played for Laughs lesbians were something else
entirely Marina Dietrich turned on both men and women with this scene in 1930s
Morocco a woman in a tuxedo wasn't entirely unheard of coming out of the Roaring 20s but a woman in a tuxedo on
film that was groundbreaking the lesbian kiss a cherry
on top Gary Cooper may have been dietrich's real love interest in the film but everybody left the theater
talking about that scene not long after Morocco we got Queen Christina the story
of a realife Swedish Monarch who was Infamous for being a pretty out and proud lesbian for the day though the
filmmakers went out of their way to straightwashing her real life sexuality bled onto the Celluloid dis despite
their best efforts there are rumors that your majesty is planning a foreign
marriage they're baseless but your majesty you cannot die
an old man I have no intention to Chancellor I
shall die as Bachelor along with homosexuality sex
violence and orgies were pretty common in early Hollywood oddly in biblical films and some people we're getting fed
up with it starting in 1922 after the earliest of these morally questionable films had become massive successes and a
series of realife Hollywood scandals had rocked the papers Studio heads enlisted William H Hayes the former Postmaster
General so he was obviously qualified to rehabilitate Hollywood's image he was
one of the few United members of Warren G Harding's administration at the time so obviously his moral fortitude was
robust in 1924 he ented introduced a set of recommendations dubbed the formula
The Formula
which Studios were advised to strictly follow back in 1915 the Supreme Court case Mutual film Corporation V
Industrial Commission of Ohio had already decided that Free Speech laws didn't extend to Motion Pictures stating
that because film may be used for evil we cannot regard censorship as beyond the power of the government so the
industry was on thin ice as it was it could be a disaster for them to draw the ire of conservatives in government
directors and writers though mostly ignored the suggestions in 1927 Hayes
strongly suggested Studios form a committee to discuss film censorship the heads of MGM and fox complied and
created a list of don'ts and be careful this Oddball list included things like pointed profanity by either title or lip
this includes the words God Lord Jesus Christ unless they be used reverently in connection with the proper religious
ceremonies hell damn God and every other profane and vulgar expression however it
may be spelled any Lous or suggestive nudity in fact or in silhouette and any
lecherous or Lous notice thereof by other characters in the picture the
illegal traffic of drugs any inference of sex
perversion white slavery but not black slavery that was fine misation or sexual
relationship between the races sex hygiene and venial
diseases scenes of actual childbirth in factor in silhouette as long as it isn't
shown on screen children's sex organs okay this one actually you know makes
sense ridicule of the clergy willful offense to Any Nation race or Creed I
feel like not all races were included in that special care should also be taken when portraying the use of firearms the
American flag men and women sharing a bed and actual murder so it was relatively okay to show actual murder
but even the idea the inference of homosexuality was a big big no no the
Federation of Women's Club was one of the loudest voices of the era calling for theaters to be raided by police if
they dare show any films released before the code was put into effect we hope that it will not be necessary to close
The Haze Code
all the motion picture houses because of some of the ones that are not desirable
but that we will have cleaner and better Motion Pictures so that they may all stay open in 1930 the code was agreed
upon by the studios and put into effect essentially making the depiction of homosexuality on screen more or less
illegal the code sets up high standards of performance for motion picture
producers it states the considerations which good taste and Community value
make necessary in this Universal form of entertainment Joe Breen ran the code
office for two decades his position authorized him to change anything about a movie from the script plots edits
characters even camera angles under his rule the Lost weekend a novel about an
alcoholic coming to terms with his sexuality became a movie about an alcoholic with writers block
Crossfire a novel about gay bashing became a novel about anti-Semitism cockeyed philosophies of
life ugly sex situations cheap jokes and dirty dialogue are not
wanted decent people don't like this sort of stuff many writers and directors in Hollywood many of them G themselves
were not too happy with the implementation of the haze code especially since in places like Ware
Republic Germany advancement of queer representation on film was becoming
mainstream at least until the rise of Adolf Hitler they saw what little progress that was taking place in North
American Cinema come to a screeching halt with the haze code introduction and they decided to fight back against it
any way they could and the only way they could at the time was to create characters that were quite obviously gay
to any queer person watching but who could fly under the radar of the sensors one way to get the sensors to turn the
Queer Villains
other way was to code villains as gay such as the obsessive Mrs danverse and
Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca after the titular Rebecca dies it is revealed to the audience that her
housekeeper Mrs danverse has kept all of her clothes with a special care given to
her underwear another example is 1941's the maltes Falcon in the film Peter Lori
plays Joel Cairo one of the film's villains in the book on which it's based Cairo is stated very clearly to be gay
queer in fact but in the movie It's instead inferred with his business card being sprayed with perfume a lilting
feminine demeanor and his propensity to orally fondle his Cane this trend of
coding villains as gay lasted for decades a topic I covered more in depth in my monsters in the Closet video
sometimes the sensors would turn a blind eye to lesbians on the screen but only under certain circumstance ances the
lesbian prison movie became almost a cliche in the 1940s and 50s killing two birds with one stone scaring girls into
following the law lest they end up in prison with big scary lesbians and convincing many young lesbians to go
straight since lesbians seem to have no fate but to end up in prison lesbians in
these movies tended to be played by large imposing women and they likely had a position of authority within the
prison not guards or anything like that God forbid but the women who had been in
prison the longest had relationships with the guards and so the guards were more likely to turn a blind eye to their
safic Tendencies representation of queer women was more subtle in 1950s young man with
a horn but just barely Lauren Bal plays Amy an obviously bisexual character that
becomes a chaotic force in the life of our main character Rick while observing Doris days Joe Jordan Amy comments it
was interesting isn't she so simple and uncomplicated must be wonderful to wake up in the
morning and know just which door you're going to walk through she's so terribly normal she's referred to by other
characters as having a twisted mind and eventually Rick tells her that she's sick this description falling into the
prevailing medical opinion on homosexuality at the time an iconic example of queer coding that straddles
Rebel Without a Cause
the line of haze coat approval is 1955's Rebel Without a Cause starring two teen
heartthrobs James Dean and salino both of whom are at least rumored to have been queer Dean's character Jim is a
teenager kicking against Authority and parental neglect who becomes both friend and Fascination to mino's Plato a lonely
younger kid Plato is obviously gay although it's easier to say that in 2020 than it was in
1955 if you don't pick up on that from the photo of hunky Allen lad that Plato has taped inside of his locker or the
looks of adoration he gives Jim it becomes abundantly clear when he makes a
coded Declaration of love to gym late in the film no not ready to come out yet no
no okay promise you nothing will happen if
you do no are you
cold here it's warm here my jacket it's warm
can I keep it Jim has feelings for Plato too although the main narrative is him falling in love with Natalie Wood's
character Judy James Dean could read the subtext though prior to filming the intense encounter with Mino in the
abandoned Getty Mansion he told him look at me the way that I look at Natalie
such homoerotic bonding couldn't be spoken about in the repressive 1950s being gay was still illegal in most of
the country and at minimum frowned upon everywhere else and the sensors of the day took pains to keep it that way a
production code officer sent a memo to Jack Warner in the spring of 1955 during the filming of Rebel Without a Cause
reminding the Warner Brothers executive that it is of course vital that there be
no inference of a questionable or homosexual relationship between Plato and
Jim hey you want to come home with me I mean there's nobody home at my house heck I'm not tired are you now that's
some subtle inference most straight reviewers of Rebel didn't pick up on anything beyond Boy Meets Girl and the
Romantic entanglements the strongest impact the film makes is non-verbal operating on an unconscious level the
mere sight of Dean and Mino exhibiting unabashed love for each other sent a powerful message Dean's Jim isn't afraid
to show affection for Plato as well as Judy as Brave as the filmmakers were to
show a pretty blatant example of a gay or at least questioningly gay relationship on screen they knew the
strict morals of the day might take the picture down so Plato the more obviously
gay of the two characters has to die in the end he can't live happily ever after he can't live at all can't give the
impression that that kind of Lifestyle could result in anything but pain and death James Dean would die in a car
accident before the film was even released and salino would be stabbed to death in West Hollywood at the age of 37
BenHur
and now for an Abrupt segue you wouldn't expect expect there to be queer coding in Ben her of all
movies the book was subtitled the tale of the Christ but there actually is gor
vdal screenwriter of the film said this in 1996 let's say that these two guys when
they were 1560 when they last saw each other they had been lovers and now they're meeting again and the Roman
wants to start it up Masala played by Steven Boyd wants to started up again with benur played by Charlton H and Heen
knows why but he does anyway he's Roman so uh Willie stared at me face
gray and I said well I'll never use the word there'll be nothing
overt but it'll be perfectly clear that masalah is in love with Ben
her willus said Gore this has been her a tale of the Christ I think is the
subtitle he said rather vaguely looking around and Willie finally said well it's
certainly better than what we've got we'll try [Music]
it after all these years still close in every
way he said have you talked to anybody about this and I said no he said you
talk to Boyd Masala uh don't say anything to hon
because Chuck will fall apart I'll take care of him so hon thinks he's doing Francis X
Bushman in a silent version his head is always constantly on high like this and like this and Steven Boyd is acting it
two pieces there are looks that he gives him that are just so clear I said I'd come
back I never thought you would benur wasn't the only surprising movie you'd find queer coding in as the production
code began to lose its grip on Hollywood westerns were also not immune can I say
[Music] did maybe you'd like to see
mine nice awful nice you know there are only two things more beautiful than a good gun Swiss watch or a woman from
anywhere you ever had a good Swiss watch gosh Mighty you're the prettiest
thing I ever seen never know a woman could look like
that say how do you hold that dress up there
please I'm going to kill you I
know if I don't kill you first characters meeting the obvious gay
stereotypes even started popping up in mainstream comedies like in lover come back in 1961
yeah H this is bad either but what color is that floor lilac lilac Leonard who has a lilac
floor in their kitchen I have
oh well Leonard everyone isn't as artistic as you
are and straight characters started acting gay in order to get a woman in bed funnily enough an awful lot of these
characters were played by Rock Hudson tell me about your job must be very
exciting working with all them colors and fabrics and [Music]
all and then came Sun like at hot a movie where two straight musicians dress
and drag in order to avoid the mafia killer looking for them one of the first major Studio films to be released
without the motion picture production code approval since the 1930s men oh you don't have to worry
about that we wouldn't be caught dead with men with rough hairy beasts with
eight hand the code had been weakening for years as social attitudes became more Progressive and many consider some
like at hot to be the final nail in the code coffin even though it would technically remain in effect until 1968
Spartacus
a famous instance of gay coding being too obvious even for the production code office was 1960 Spartacus where slave
antonitis played by Tony Curtis who was also in some like at hot bathes his Master played by Lawrence
Olivier do you eat oysters when I have the
master do you eat snails no
master do you consider the eating of oers to be moral and the eating of snails to be
immoral no master of course
not my taste includes both snails and
[Music] oysters the bisexual overtones of snails
and oysters was too obvious even for the pretty oblivious sensors of the day an
adaptation of the Tennessee Williams plague had on a Hot Tin Roof also had a blue pencil taken to it to remove queer
references what are you suggesting nothing but but what come on
say what's on your mind say it why are you so excited go ahead say
it what are you shouting like that for ski and I were friends can you understand that gooper and may said that
Skipper SK is the only thing that I got left to believe in and you are dragging it through the gutter you are making it
shameful and filthy you and even more egregiously with another Tennessee Williams adaptation
Suddenly Last Summer screenwriter gor Vidal seemed to be writing a lot of these movies at the time said the film
was forced before the Legion of decency and cut to bits until it made no sense at all but the messaging though now
coded was still there that the Unseen character of Sebastian used the women in his life to
attract men he could sleep with ending in his violent Murder by a Savage mob
when the film was released the New York Times ran a scathing review telling potential movie goers if you'd like
incest rape sodomy cannibalism degeneracy this sickening picture is the
the one for you inadvertently they had given the film the best advertising campaign it could possibly hope for
The Children
making it a breakaway success for stars Elizabeth Taylor and kathern heurn coding went out the window with 1961's
victim giving filmgoers their first gay hero and a sympathetic betrayal of
homosexuals in general the British film was attacked by sensors in the UK and
the US with UK sensors giving it an X rating and America's production code
refusing to CL classified at all decades later when it was eventually released on home
video it was rated PG-13 as the production code slowly began to fade
away in America with original restrictions like openmouth kissing nudity profanity abortion and
prostitution now finding their way through the censoring process only one remained the sex perversion Clause no
major Studios and stars had yet tackled the subject of homosexuality in any meaningful way in
Hollywood but that would change with 1961's The Children's Hour starring
Audrey heurn and Shirley mlan the film was willing to show that yes homosexuality is a thing it does exist
but it's not something good moral people should talk about mlan and heurn play two friends Martha and Karen who opened
a private school for girls when one of their students a vicious little bully is
punished by Karen by not allowing her to attend that weekend's boat race the little wretch con [ __ ] a story about
the two women being lesbians and tells her grandmother this leads to a series of ever escalating circumstances
including a lawsuit that leave the two women emotionally drained and Karen's engagement to a man
left in limbo but even after the accusation has proven false their lives are not the same Karen's fiance leaves
so Karen wants to leave town for good start a new life somewhere else a fevered back and forth leads to Martha
realizing that she actually does love Karen and not just as friends she's in love with her best friend and feels
terrible about it she feels responsible for ruining their lives and is disgusted by her feelings for Karen and so one day
while Karen is out for a walk Martha hangs herself the film was nominated for
five Academy Awards and is considered one of the best courtroom dramas ever made but its Legacy is not quite so
positive the entire movie is about how horrible it would be for two nice young women to be lesbians just the idea of it
leads people to gasp and end with one of them killing herself homosexuality was
not really a part of the movie it was only a negative plot device how people are treated when accused of a crime so
heinous the lesbian experience isn't really expressed in the film at all and even Shirley mlan has gone on record in
1996 saying William Wier the director never even spoke to her about the lesbian elements but though the film's
depiction of homosexuality and reactions to it are flawed it still Rings true to many people still live in environments
where they're called sick and dirty for being gay either by those around them or by depictions of queer people in the
media so Martha's self-loathing is all too familiar to many
people after The Children's Hour movies about queer self-loathing became more
frequent Oliver saw you you were with Dove all afternoon now you know lying to me
A Girl Like You
hiot oh well perhaps maturity will change all that what do you think I'll M you into
you now I want to know what's going on between you and that boy you in love with that Texas dirt farmer he's more
than that ah it's gone quite far already hasn't it you'd like to make him happy wouldn't you make all his dreams come
true perhaps even get married even get married all right Ally I'll be sorry to
lose you but if you think the world is your oyster go ahead and take it but how do you think the boy is going to feel
when he finds out what you are what you've been he'll forgive me all right go to him after all a Girl Like You has so much to
offer a man a knife to cut his heart out I'll change of course you'll change but haven't you said that so many times
before but go on and tell him tell them about the days and nights of Hal Gerard tell them about that mud you've rolled
in for years well tell him the thought of turning of turning
involuntarily into one of them frightened me and made me sick with
anger I went down there I had heard about the Waterfront
people Giggle and make jokes about it I had had only two experiences before
once in college once in the Army I thought I'd gotten it out of my
life but I hadn't I looked at
them was this what I was like oh my God and that self-loathing inevitably
turned to death suicide murder whatever it needed to be because it was clear
that if you were gay or coded gay in a movie you had to
die feed your faces and keep your traps shut if you don't want to go killer killer killer kill
[Music]
her
[Music]
oh oh
Coming Out
but as the 1960s came to a close there was change in the air following the Stonewall riots Hollywood finally
released a truly gay film with the release of the boys in the band In 1970
we saw our first major release feature gay characters who are out and nobody
dies 2 years later we even popped up in an Oscar juggernaut with
[Music] Cabaret maybe you just don't sleep with
girls oh you
don't it wasn't the end of gay coding but gay stereotypes began to replace it
there would still be stereotypical gay portrayals across every genre of film Butch lesbians feminine men and sneaky
bisexual and transgender people would become tropes in Hollywood that still find their ways into movies to this day
representation was rare but for the most part when it existed it existed for all to
[Music]
see [Music] out com out
I want the world to know got to that is show I'm coming now I want the world to
know to let it show there's a new me coming out and I
just got to live and I just want to give I'm completely
positive this time around think I'm going to do it like you never knew it oh
I got to prove the time has come for me to break out of the shell I have to shout that I am
coming out by the New Millennium the queer
audience was one The Producers mostly on TV but some movies were willing to appeal to Will and Grace became a Smash
Hit for NBC Queer as Folk in the LW broke ratings records for showtime and Queer Eye For The Straight Guy became a
cultural sensation in Hollywood kissing J Stein became a surprise hit the hours
was an award season darling and Brokeback Mountain made $178 million
breaking the hearts of movie goers around the world in the process but it wasn't all roses TV networks fac
Advertiser boycotts and people picketed movie theater showing Brokeback Mountain there was money to be made by appealing
to the LGBT community but it came with great risk that risk was compounded by a string of queer inclusive bombs like
running with Scissors under performers like milk and gay backlash toward movies like Bruno and I Now Pronounce You Chuck
and Larry the queer audience was a volatile one one that wouldn't accept just any
movie you gave them and if you directly appealed to the queer audience you ran the real risk of turning off the Straits
so producers and writers needed to figure out a way to appeal to the gays without putting off the heteros and they
looked to a burgeoning internet fan Community to find the answers the Harry
Potter series of books and movies had birthed Harry Draco SL fiction on online forums and was becoming a massive Trend
with stories and art spreading all over the Internet although the characters have almost no positive interactions at
all in the books or movies let alone romantic ones fans were drawing romantic conclusions from breadcrumbs that really
didn't even exist this is when creators realized that the queer Community would do the work for you they'd fill in the
LGBT shaped blanks and all you had to do was drop a few hints and leave a few
empty spaces and straight audiences be none the
wiser and so gab bating was
A Caveat
born now here's where I lay out a little caveat for you in doing my research for this I found enough instances of gay
baiting to fill a whole book let alone a video so I decided to break it down into eight in instances that stood out
amongst the rest these got the most media attention and the most fanfiction
and the most fan attention I'm also not going to be covering any queer baiting that was eventually made canonical like
with the legend of Kora in Adventure Time that's actually called queer catching which is when a character's
queerness is confirmed after a media franchise has finished and therefore
you're not running the possibility of impacting its ratings or its sales or or you reveal that a character is gay on a
press tour for a movie but it's never really manifests in the movie itself the most infamous example of this would be a
certain British author confirming that Dumbledore was gay after her book series had ended but she doubled down by
actually queerbaiting him in a future film installment but we're not done talking about her and her Wizards oh no
not yet an interesting Trend in queer baiting is that slightly more loose rules apply to lesbian characters when
two female characters are queer they may actually end up coupling up in the end of the story this is of course because
according to market research and I work in marketing so I know this male and female audiences are both more okay with
lesbian characters than gay characters while straight male audiences are likely to turn off immediately when two male
characters turn out to be gay it's even shown that parents are more likely to be okay with their kids seeing a lesbian
couple than a gay couple the Assumption at least among media researchers is that it's easy for heteronormative audiences
to view lesbian coup coupl asexually since there's technically no penetrative sex unless you actually know a lesbian
and know that sex toys exist but even then lesbian characters are only likely to be confirmed to be queer at the end
of the story if not afterwards in some other form of media uh novels comic books stuff like that again this
happened with the legend of Kora notoriously it also almost happened very recently with the new incarnation of
Shira but they got that lesbian confirmation in right under the wire and of course that research doesn't cover
everyone and there are plenty of people who find lesbians just as disgusting as gay men the acceptance of lesbians in
mainstream culture is just slightly more prevalent mostly thanks to Ellen's brand of family safe gayness but if anyone of
you wants to share some videos or articles that cover lesbian queer baiting that I might have missed please
share them with me and I will link them in the description below and I just want everyone to
know I tried to include Supernatural I did but try as I might I could not follow that show at all it makes no
Merlin
sense so now that the caveats are out of the [Music] way mlin premiered on the BBC in
September of 2008 and almost immediately became fod for gay fanfiction and it's no wonder why Colin Moran Merlin and
Bradley James's Prince Arthur he's not a king yet have so much sexual tension between them you could cut it with a
knife Merlin is set in ancient albon a mythical version of England in a Time
prior to the aruan legends mostly prior to the arthan Legends Merlin has become The Apprentice of gaas the king's
potions Master Merlin in case you didn't know also has the ability to use magic but he needs to keep it secret from
everyone because the King Arthur's father Uther is homophobic I I mean he hates magic hates it so much that he
believes people ought to be executed if they have magical powers because it's
simply not natural we soon meet his annoyingly arrogant son Arthur and I mean yeah I'd probably be annoyingly
arrogant too if I looked like that when Merlin meets the Prince they don't quite get along but while at a royal function
as gas's guest Merlin ends up saving Arthur's life to thank him for his bravery King Uther bestows Merlin the
wondrous honor of being Arthur's manservant I mean there could be worse jobs Merlin though is not happy but he
decides to go along with it after meeting a dragon that informs him that Arthur is his Destiny how can it my
destiny to protect someone who hates me a half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole oh great just what I
needed another Riddle That your and Arthur's path lies together is but the
truth if you've read Plato Symposium that whole two halves making a whole thing will mean a lot or if you're not a
nerd and just understand romantic language tropes as a quick aside as TV
dragons go can you believe Game of Thrones came came out just 3 years after
this so how is it that these two characters who hate each other could become friends each other's Destiny oh
come on you've seen a romantic comedy you know how this works by episode 4 they've grown so close that when Merlin
has been poisoned Prince Arthur risks his life to save him by venturing into the cave of an evil beast in order to
get a flower that acts as the antidote to the poison Arthur who starts off as a
pompous ass is willing to risk his own life to save the life of his servant one that could easily be replaced maybe even
by someone who doesn't need a limb so much by the end of the first season they're both willing to drink poison to
save the other's life but even after that there's a tension between them since Arthur is a prince and Merlin is
just a lowly servant all right I know I'm a prince so we can't be
friends but if I wasn't a prince what well then
think we probably get on as the seasons go on Merlin's feelings for Arthur become more
prevalent he becomes incredibly jealous when women show affection to Arthur there's a running gag about him wanting
to hug Arthur and he's not shy about ripping Arthur's pants off but there's a
bond between the two one that Merlin can't let become too strong he can't
become too connected to Arthur because he's gay I mean a wizard he's gay and a wizard and Arthur's own father would
execute Merlin if he found out about him in fact the show doesn't exactly
hide that magic is a metaphor for homosexuality it's on the level of obviousness of X-Men 2 even in the
language used no one ever says they practice magic they say that they have magic it's something they're born with
something they have no say over and yet they're persecuted for it anyway because of the ignorance of the majority what if
magic isn't something you choose what if it chooses
[Music] you magic is Merlin's greatest weapon though and he uses it to save Arthur's
life time and time again throughout the series Merlin is so close to Arthur so drawn to him despite the servant Master
divide between them that he's willing to risk his life not just to save Arthur's life but to even be around him if he
were to accidentally use magic in front of the wrong person it would be the end of him he even hides his magic from
Arthur because he fears Arthur would hate him if he found out a feeling all too familiar to queer kids
developing crushes on their presumed straight friends as the series progresses the
dynamic between the two becomes even clearer Arthur seems to prefer the company of Merlin to most anyone else
and though Arthur falls in love with a servant girl named Gwen that only intensifies Merlin's hope as it means
Arthur can love a servant and when Merlin goess Arthur into revealing his
true feelings about Gwen it sounds like he's talking about Merlin
just say it I can't how can I admit that I think about
her all the time or that I care about her more than
anyone strangely fond with the boy how can I admit that I don't know what I'll do if any
harm comes to her came back is you're the only friend I have and I couldn't B you to admit my feelings knowing
that hurts too much but even quen's not blind to how Arthur feels about
Merlin why would he want to help you why shouldn't he cuz he's a prince and you're a
servant he doesn't care about that sort of thing he's you know chalous
right so he's like that with all the mates and C up no yes I
mean and then Arthur's father dies and since he was the homophobic I mean magic
phobic son of a [ __ ] that was making everyone's Liv so difficult it's the Catalyst for Arthur to become his own
person a king he can think the way he wants to and love who he wants to so it's telling that at a single point in
the show where he feels the most isolated emotionally the most down the most defeated he looks to Merlin with
longing he realizes he's not alone that he'll never be alone because Merlin is with him and from that point on he not
only shows real respect for Merlin but admiration when Merlin is in danger Arthur rides to his rescue the king
doesn't send his Knights to save his servant he goes himself to save his partner at the end of the series after a
battle with Morgana and mor dread leaves Arthur mortally wounded his final words are for no one but
Merlin we will mat I'll save my life I can't I'm not
going to lose you just just first just hold
please wanting to be held by the person most important to you your best friend
and partner a small Comfort at the end of your life a final prophecy for tells that
Arthur will one day return and so Merlin the immortal wizard wanders the Earth
waiting for that day when they can be reunited obviously Merlin and Arthur are
never confirmed to be gay but the chemistry between the two characters was so potent from the very beginning of the
series that fans immediately ran with it in fanfiction fanfiction that made it to the showrunners who decided to give
those fans a little bit more red meat as each new season went on and even though there is ner an uncoded queer moment on
the show Merlin is still listed as an lgbtq show on many sites online the Merlin fandom turned it into
a big hit for the BBC and it ended up airing all across the world because of it but they weren't the only show on the
BBC that realized what kind of audience queer baiting could bring [Music]
Sherlock
you Sherlock began its on again off again run on the BBC in 2010 a modern
reimagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Victorian mystery novels Sherlock explores the lives of the residents of
221 B Baker Street London those Being John Watson and Sherlock Holmes
the gay question is actually brought up before they even move in together you don't have a girlfriend then girlfriend
no not really my [Music] area all
right do you have a boyfriend which is fine by the way I know it's
fine so you go to boyfriend no right okay Sherlock then does assume Jon is
coming on to him and explains he's too wrapped up in his work to be in a relationship while this could easily be
read as a fun misunderstanding Sherlock is a master at reading people he's
practically psychic at times so if he read the situation as if John had a heart on for him well maybe he did hell
when the waiter approaches Sherlock he assumes Jon is his date Sherlock anything on the menu whatever you want
free Bonnie house for you and for your date do you want to eat I'm not his date so one must presume that Sherlock has
brought men here before for and Sherlock isn't the one to deny it John is
emphatically another person who knows Sherlock very well would be his land lady who also assumes Watson to be
Sherlock's boyfriend I've met someone oh lovely yeah we're getting
married well I'm going to ask anyway so soon after Sherlock well yes what's his name it's a
woman a woman yes of course it's a woman yet another person to assume wants into to to be at least Incredibly Close with
Sherlock is Mor Ari who knows Jon is the one person he can threaten and Sherlock
will actually give a damn I'm glad no one saw that you ripping my clothes off in a
dark and swimming pool people might talk John is so no homo it hurts he's so no
homo in fact that he dates a string of unremarkable women all of whom he chooses Sherlock over you're a great
boyfriend okay that's good I mean I always thought I was great Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky
man even they think he's gay but after Sherlock quote unquote dies Jon is left
broken he doesn't know how to cope he wanted to say something to Sherlock before he died something incredibly
important when his therapist asks him to say it now he can't he can't bring
himself to say it out loud to another person it was only for
Sherlock say it now
sorry I can't what could it have been Irene Adler
knows we're not a couple yes you are who who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes but for the record if anyone out there still cares I'm not
actually gay well I am look at us both
an expert in human sexuality and how men's minds work her statement that she
is in fact gay is interesting since she's obviously in love with Sherlock
saying in essence that you can be primarily attracted to women but still fall in love with Sherlock Holmes moving
forward JN gets so incredibly jealous whenever Sherlock comes in contact with a
woman and Sherlock gets incredibly jealous whenever John interacts with another man
so that's him major SCH uhhuh they're such good friends why does he barely
even mention him he mentions him all the time to me he never shuts up about him about him it's definitely him that he
talks about MH very John says he's the most unsociable man he's ever met he is
he's the most unsociable he's Banting around him like a puppy then there is Mary the woman
John eventually gets married to she's a special one someone who understands his relationship with Sherlock it even
encourages it they kind of become a thruple for a while until she does the
one thing Sherlock could never forgive she hurts Jon John forgives her but
Sherlock holds on to that anger until the day she dies jumping in front of a bullet to protect him so does Sherlock
love Jon yes he might be the only person he does love does JN love Sherlock everyone certainly
seems to think he does is it ever confirmed really one way or another of
course not because confirming it one way or another means that you might lose one group of fans or another the oblivious
Straits or the Love Struck shippers they knew better they knew how to queer bait and become an international hit show
doing it plus it's extra egregious because one of the shows creators Mar gatus is gay
Harry Potter
himself God damn it British people I said we'd
be getting back to the Wizards didn't I Harry Potter and the cursed child is a two-night play that's been dominating
the West End and Broadway since it first opened in 2016 now since it's a play without a
whole lot of live footage we'll be relying on quotes from The Script here but before I even start Alvis Potter and
Scorpio Malfoy are gay don't care what anyone says not going to change Chang my mind
now why do I think this well let's start off with how they meet Albus and his
cousin Rose are on their way to their first year at Hogwarts Albus opens a
door to look in on a lonely blonde kid Scorpius in an otherwise empty
compartment alus smiles scorpus smiles back well that's innocent enough two
boys smiling at each other doesn't scream gay agenda to me eventually rose
leaves the two and we get this description Scorpius and Albus look at each other and something passes between
them things pass between me and my Straight friends all the time when we were starting puberty no big deal the
play moves on to follow the lives of our two boys over the next few years focused obviously on Albus since he's Harry
Potter's kid and all we learned more about albus's life at home his awkward relationship with his family he feels
like he doesn't fit in especially after being sorted into Slytherin with a family entirely made up of gryffindors
say same for Scorpius he doesn't live up to his father's expectations either he's a bit weird kind of a goofball which
doesn't fly with the Malfoy family so although they both feel alienated from their families they feel at home with
each other a safe harbor in an otherwise Rocky sea Harry tried to make Albus feel
welcome but he just doesn't understand his son it's an easy allegory for
parents of queer kids trying to be accepting but they're just can't get it right Scorpius is the only person that
alus feels comfortable with alibus hugs his friend with
fierceness they hold for a beat Scorpius is surprised by
this okay uh hello um have we hugged before do we hug the two boys awkwardly
dislocate alus will not hug his father or family but he'll hug Scorpius
fiercely with passion so because the structure of this play is a bit off
we're in year four now and Albus wants to go back to his father's fourth year
and save Cedric diory from being murdered because that's something his father couldn't do so he and Scorpius
ditched the train to Hogwarts in order to find the last surviving Time Turner and save Cedric if we're doing this
we're doing it together tagging along with them is a girl
who in case you haven't seen the play or read the script I don't want to say who
she really is because it's a spoiler and stupid but there's a girl named Deli or delie and Albus kind of digs her and
Scorpius is conflicted about this Scorpius appears at the back of the stage he looks at his friend talking to
a girl and part of him likes it part of him doesn't delie won't be
going back in time with them though because reasons as they make their way through the Forbidden Forest the pair
talk about their lives and Albus reveals how how much he hates it at Hogwarts how
terrible it is for him not for me Albus looks at his friend shocked all
I ever wanted to do was go to Hogwarts and have a mate to get up to Mayhem with
just like Harry Potter and I got his son how crazily fortunate is that they
more or less succeed in Saving Cedric but when they return to their time everything is odd Albus is in Gryffindor
now and Harry doesn't want him seeing scorpus anymore I need you to stay away from Scorpius Malfoy what
Scorpius I don't know how you became friends in the first place but you did and now I I need you to my best friend
my only friend he's dangerous this reads painfully like a parent finding out that
their son has a boyfriend and telling them that under no circumstances are they to see them
again alus gives in and Promises not to see Scorpius anymore
alibus you're okay that's fantastic he's completely cured and
we've got to go alvus looks up at Scorpius and his heart breaks he walks
on are you mad at me what's going on alus stops and turns to
Scorpius did it work did any of it work no but
Albus Albus whatever gibberish you're talking you need to stop it now this is
your final warning Albus looks torn between his dad and his
friend I can't okay you can't what just
we'll be better off without each other okay Scorpius is left looking up after
him heartbroken Harry's a dick hell even
Draco becomes the voice of reason confronting Harry about the situation I'm not here to to antagonize you but my
son is in tears and I am his father and so I'm here to ask you why you would
keep apart two good friends not keeping them apart you've changed School
timetables you've threatened both teachers and Albus himself why Harry
looks at Draco carefully and then turns away I have to protect my son again
Harry is a dick later on delie approaches Scorpius Albus needs you
Scorpius that's a wonderful thing he needs me to do what that's the thing
isn't it about friendships you don't know what he needs you only know he needs it find him Scorpius you two you
belong together scorpius's life is even worse now that alvus isn't in it the two eventually have a fevered argument that
leaves Scorpius even more distraught and lost people think he's the son of Voldemort complicated very complicated
stupidly complicated he thinks he's a terrible person that maybe all the horrible things said about him are
true Albus disagrees no they're not true and I'll tell you why because I don't
think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son and you're kind scorpus to the
depths of your belly to the tips of your fingers I truly believe V Voldemort couldn't have a child like you be
Scorpius is moved by this that's nice that's that's a nice thing to say and it's something I should
have said a long time ago in fact you're probably the best person I know and you don't you couldn't hold me back you you
make me stronger when Dad forced us apart without
you I didn't much like my life without you in it either the two boys reconcile
finally realizing that they need each other in their lives they go back in time again to fix the mistakes and the
timeline but they screw it up even worse so bad now that Albus doesn't even
exist Dolores Umbridge is head Mistress of Hogwarts and baldemort is still alive time travel is problematic in this new
timeline Scorpius is super popular the guy everyone wants to be but he hates it
he wants his old life even with how unhappy he was none of this new happy life is worth it because he can't have
Albus with him Scorpius finds out that Snape is still alive and approaches him to help in
getting Albus back Snape along with alternate timeline Ron and Hermione agree to help
Scorpius in the process Ron and Hermione are attacked by Dementors Albus is terrified but Snape tells him that the
memory of one person one person who makes you so happy that memory is enough
to defeat the Dementors Snape even compares how Scorpius feels about Albus
to how he felt about Lily Potter as problematic as Snape's infatuation with Lily is he loved her and he sees that
scorpus feels the same way for Albus taking the Albus scorpus relationship Beyond even a teenage
romance and into a love that lasts for decades the death murder war and Magic
cannot stop and unlike with Snape and Lily though Albus feels the same way they're
completely devoted to one another scorpus succeeds in bringing Albus back and is speechless when he
sees him again though Albus is completely unaware of what's taking place and thinks he's only blacked out
for a couple of minutes Scorpius grabs him and hugs him tight the rest of the
play is pretty much a hot mess eventually dark Wizards are after them ready to go in for the kill so we hide
in a hole as pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next 40
years they'll find us and we'll die and time will be stuck in the wrong position
no we we need something we can control something we know he'll get exactly the right time we need to there's
nothing still if I had to choose a companion to be at the return of Eternal Darkness with I'd choose you Good Winds
out over evil of course and Albus and scorpius's lives go back to normal and at the very end of the damn play we get
a forced scene where scorpus acts like he has interest in a girl because even
the writers knew these two were in love with each other but families were going to go see this so God forbid we don't
know omo them as hard as possible in the last 5 minutes so she who must not be named has
said there will never be a cursed Child movie which Warner Brothers might disagree with considering how well this play is doing but I think she's right
because no one will be able to watch this movie and not see these two boys as gay no matter how many no homo endings
you tag on honestly Harry Draco kind of helped create modern gay fan fiction and
then alvus and Scorpius were this close to making a version of it Canon this
close I am thoroughly convinced that at some point in the writing process the playwrights did intend on them being gay
and it got switched somewhere along the line it's not unheard of it's not the first time that's
happened the reboot SL sequel to The Oceans 11
franchise Stars an amazing almost all female cast including Sandra Bullock Kate Blanchett Aquafina Sarah palson an
hathway Rihanna Helena bottom Carter the first time I watched the movie I was honestly shocked at how a major movie
with some of the biggest stars in the world had two lesbian leading characters
but then the movie ended and oh they're not lesbians I call [ __ ] Debbie ocean
played by Sandra bulock and Lou played by Kate Blanchett are essentially a couple I don't care if it's never stated
in the movie they're a couple or at least they were a couple before Debbie landed in The Slammer and I wasn't the
only one who saw this queer people around the world noticed it even straight people one could even argue
that this movie is meant to set straight women onto the proper path of lesbianism and crime but nothing of the sort is
ever stated outright in the movie so why did so many people read it that way well
first off blanchett's character is coded extremely gay the outfits that she wears
are crafted to queer Perfection but if you look past the aesthetic glory of the
film you'll see that there's a real love between Debbie and Lou coming at this film with a queer lens I initially felt
like the filmmakers were saying it without actually saying it giving us queer characters whose whole point in life isn't just being queer characters
while telling about her history of running Cons with Lou Debbie refers to Lou as as her partner business partner
life partner yes when recalling a rock bottom moment for the two when they were
pulling scams at a retirement home's Bingo night Debbie refers to this as their rough patch were they strapped for
cash or On the Rocks romantically again yes queer people would read this
phrasing as an obvious admission of their lesbian relationship while straight people would just read it as a
they're such good friends because straight people can be clueless like that there's actually a
term for this obliviousness in the gay community it's called the Great straight divide when straight people are so
clueless they actually believe that two men are roommates or two women who have lived together for 20 years are Gallop
Pals additionally there's physical flirtation between the duo in a diner
Sandra spoon feeds Kate a bite of her food in a very intimate lady in the [ __ ] esque manner I don't know about
you but I never delicately play sporkful of diner food onto my platonic friend's tongues whenever the duo interacts it's
clear there's a shared intimacy between them that the other women in the crew don't experience with each other so for
me nothing about their relationship points to just being friends and honestly I could keep going on but it's actually been confirmed Sarah Edwards
costume designer for the movie said in an interview after the film's release you know early there was an idea that
Lou and Debbie having been in a relationship might have been the case but we seem to move away from that as
shooting went on so when they started production Lou and Debbie had been in a relationship but by the time they'd
wrapped that was no longer the case secret lesbians confirmed Now give me a
sequel so they can kiss [Music]
already oh God here we go hitting TV screens in 2011 the MTV show became
famous for its propensity to show nearly naked men in nearly every episode maybe
it was their way of paying reparations for the I'm not a [ __ ] I'm a werewolf line from the 1985 movie the whole show
is pretty gay if we're being honest kind of like a teenage version of True Blood in more ways than one but the relationship that drove the series into
will they won't they territory was between lovable nerd Styles and brooding Alpha werewolf Derek fondly known online
by the couple name sterk much like with Merlin the pair start the series off on a bad paw but
over the course of a few seasons end up in a scenario that if they a man and a woman would undoubtedly end in a
relationship but because they're two guys well Dad there's a conversation
that we you're not gay I could be not dress like that uh I
thought you like girls I do like girls you absolutely great so you also like
boys absolutely do
you so pretty quickly it set up that style is bisexual is it set outright no
of course not that would be too easy but is it made painfully obvious I don't think Danny likes me very much I asked
Alison on a date and now we're hanging out am I not attractive to gay guys I make first line and the team captain
wants to destroy me and now I'm going to be late for work wait Scott you didn't
am I attractive to gayot you didn't answer my question everyone wants you you know you're like
the hot girl that every guy wants hey come on Jackson you're way too pretty to be out here all by yourself
we should maybe take this upstairs he's might
tyght okay how you can come too and I also got to say this new found heroism has making me very attracted to
you shut up no seriously try make it out for a second just to see how it feels yes yes it is when Styles and the main
character Scott go to a gay bar Styles even gets frustrated when a guy buys a
drink for Scott and not for him why are they at a gay bar because it's Teen Wolf
why would wouldn't they be at a gay bar one more question what do you find me
attractive someone needs to have sex with me like today like someone needs to sex me right now all right I'll do
it what come to my place at 9:00 plan to stay the night I like to
cuddle that was so sweet are you kidding yes I'm kidding okay you know you don't toy with
a guy's emotions like that Danny it's not attractive all right
okay this is becoming a look how queer Styles his clip show so let's move on to Derek Derek is straight very straight he
has all the girlfriends he's emotionally distant locked off and doesn't like being touched but Styles can't get him
off his mind no more questions no more talk about the alpha or
Derek especially Derek in one episode Derrik is paralyzed
by a monster and has to be held afloat in the middle of a pool by Styles because the monster can't swim Styles
holds him up for over two hours much like Merlin Styles risks his life for Derek over and over and over again and
becomes visibly jealous when girls show interest in his hunky wear crush his feelings for Derek are not subtle and
this is not an accident even the action is pointing toward romance whether it's obvious or not take this scene where
they're both paralyzed again Styles files on top of Derek the same way that
we've seen women fall on top of men in a 100 romantic comedies the way they lock
eyes time and time again the way they annoy each other needle each other but
always come to the rescue this is not subtle this is on purpose in an
interview with after Elton Show creator Jeff Davis said said I'm trying to create a world where there's no racism
there's no sexism there's no homophobia and I know it's not real life but I kind of don't care I'd like to create a world
where none of that matters you have the supernatural creatures for that to work as an analogy in my mind if you can
create a world like that on TV maybe Life Starts to imitate it that's a very
Noble Pursuit but it's not realistic to even try to achieve it there are plenty of out queer characters on Teen Wolf but
none of them are leads the steric fandom became rabbit online with art and fanfiction becoming just as popular as
the show itself some of the cast encouraged the shipping including Dylan O'Brien and Tyler hin who would cuddle
with each other at Fan events they baited sterk as a couple they baited
Styles as sexuality with absolutely no intention on following through the
reason this is so onerous is because the queer baiting didn't even stay in the show they moved it over into real life
Styles wasn't just coded adorably bisexual they used queer baiting to get you to do something for them vote for us
uh it's Team Wolf for best summer show yeah team Choice summer show something
just find Team Wolf and vote for it just whenever you see Teen Wolf fill in that Circle cuz we really appreciate it and
we'll take more naps like these for you maybe on you screen yeah now I'm going to be stuck to
that Derek all the way I don't know maybe I'm inordinately frustrated by this because Dylan O'Brien's so
cute this is probably the most obvious example of queer baiting to have ever
existed in monitored media but it wasn't the most well-known bringing out the big
guns now arguably the three biggest media franchises in the world right now are Star Wars Frozen and the Marvel
Cinematic Universe they all have a few things in common they're all owned by Disney and they've all been accused of
queer baiting Disney is actually kind of terrible for this not only do they queerbait their characters they actually
create queer media and then yank it away from you love Victor was a sequel TV
series to the hit film love Simon it was announced alongside Disney plus as one of the big reasons to buy into the
service but then when the show actually had gay content Disney shafted it over
to Hulu which is not available in nearly as many places as Disney plus essentially segregating a gay show that
they had promised their viewers putting it on a service with a fraction of the subscribers that way when the ratings
aren't that great they can just say it wasn't popular and let it die maybe even use it as an example as to why queer
content doesn't sell like I said in my Stonewall film effect video as far as executives are concerned a queer movie
or show or book that fails always fails because it's queer never because of the circumstances around
it okay r over [Music]
Frozen there's not a whole lot to show about Frozen because most of the queer coding is in song and Disney will come
down on me with the intellectual property Hammer if I play a song from Frozen but the first film was read as
super queer by a sizable portion of the population so much so that homophobic
bloggers accuse Disney of indoctrinating children with the gay agenda but they
wouldn't have anything to WR about if children weren't being indoctrinated in the gay agenda so let's ignore them but
actual lgbtq fans of the film latched on to Elsa being the first potentially queer Disney princess creating the
Evergreen social media Trend #g Elsa a girlfriend Let It Go became a sort of a
gay anthem and the film featured queer icon ad Menzel in the lead and gay heart throb and my future husband Jonathan gra
voicing Kristoff so fans were hoping for a lot when Frozen 2 finally hit theaters this past year while the film didn't
State Elsa SE uality one way or another it left the door open hinting at a gay relationship between her and honey Maron
and the new song show yourself while not a cultural phenomenon like Let It Go became a gay anthem I mean with these
lyrics how could it not every inch of me is trembling but not from the cold
something is familiar like a dream I can reach but not quite hold I can sense you
there like a friend I've always known I'm arriving and it feels like I am home
I have always been a fortress cold Secrets deep inside you have secrets too
but you don't have to hide show yourself I'm dying to meet you that's right Elsa
you run down that ice vagina but seriously though those lyrics sound like an email I wrote to my online boyfriend
in Ohio in the seventh grade so is Elsa gay uh maybe Frozen 3 is in development so
Elsa might climb out of her safic slump or Disney will continue to not say yes but not say no either just like they did
with one of their other Global spanning [Music]
IPS Star Wars the Force awakens introduced us to PO and Finn a rebellious pilot and a stormtrooper who
meet up by chance Escape together and fall madly in love well they didn't tell
us they fell madly in love but the actors certainly showed it when they escaped the first order they crashed land
when Finn comes to he searches for po but he's nowhere to be found Assuming he's dead Finn is heartbroken and takes
POS jacket as a reminder of [Music]
him Finn is then set up for what would usually be a love story with the lead female character Ry but no that doesn't
go anywhere Finn shows interest for sure but it's not reciprocated leaving the door open for Finn to fall in love with
someone else else maybe and eventually we find out that PO
is still alive and we get this [Music]
scene H what happened to you what happened I got thrown from the crash I woke up at night no you no ship nothing
you completed my mission Finn that's my jacket oh oh no no no no keep it it
suits you the eye [ __ ] oh my God before the
movie was released the cast went on to the Ellen show it's very subtle romance that's happening you know you have to
just look very close you have to watch it a few times to see the little hints but there was at least I was playing romance I was in the cockpit I was
playing there was a very deep romance I see so though it wasn't obvious Oscar Isaac and John boa were certainly
playing it that way so would it be more obvious in The Last Jedi well leading up to the release of
The Last Jedi Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy was asked about the potential relationship she said we've
talked about it but I think you're not going to see that in the Last Jedi in the next 6 or eight months we will have
some meetings about the stories that we will develop next after 40 Years of Adventures people have a lot of
information and a lot of theories about the path these stories can take and sometimes those theories that come up
are new ideas for us to listen to read and pay attention to so not the Last
Jedi okay running out of time here guys about rise of Skywalker well JJ
Abrams teased for months before the film's release that there would be real LGBT representation in the film a gay
kiss even obviously fans thought it would be Po and Finn but no instead
Abrams made sure to give po a female love interest neuter fin entirely and tossed in and out of focus blinking you
miss at lesbian kiss between two ascended extras after the release of Rise of Skywalker Oscar Isaac had this
to say in an interview like there was an Absol absolute natural chemistry with him uh I I immediately felt very
connected to him I remember uh it was an audition and the two of us just like did
that first scene back to back butt to butt you know just like doing the scene together practicing it in this room and
like it was just like immediately all you know all kind of artifice everything just collapsed and there was like an
intimacy that was very just like there and um and I think the fact that neither of us shied away from that while we were
shooting as well I think it just was like these are two guys that you know are he happy being intimate with each
other emotionally and that um so it wasn't actually a total shock that you
know you know people you know wanted to you know saw that in there personally I
I kind of hoped and wished that maybe that would have been T taken further uh in the other films but you know I don't
have control over that so he wasn't happy about it the fans shipping Fino weren't happy about it the gay community
wasn't happy about it and the rise of Skywalker became the lowest grossing film of the new Trilogy Star Wars is now
in brand rehab at Disney who are trying to figure out what to do with the property after it seemed
like no one could agree on any of their Five Star Wars movies that they made to date with solo bombing at the box office
and Rise of Skywalker coming nail-bitingly close to losing money I'm not saying making Po and Finn gay would
have saved the box office probably the opposite to be honest but at least Disney could have said that they did
something before any other Studio that they put gay characters in a giant cinematic spectacle before most studios
are willing to even give us a movie at all but this is the company that tossed love Victor back into the streaming
closet so what else would we expect I mean I'm sure Disney hasn't done anything like this
before what was [Music]
that Steve Rogers AKA Captain am America AKA Chris Evans because he's the real superhero and Bucky Burns AKA The Winter
Soldier are two of the many many many characters in the Disney owned Marvel Cinematic Universe they were originally
created way back in the 1940s when Bucky was actually Steve's kid sidekick because every superhero had to have a
kid sidekick fast forward 70 years and about 100 iterations later and we see the pairing that become known the world
over as Stucky right from the off there's a sort of Chemistry Between them
with Bucky kind of acting as a big brother figure to Steve who needs help fighting the bullies in his life Steve's
got a big heart but that's about the only part of him that's big wait does the Super Soldier serum make your one of
the things I noticed the first time I saw the movie which was the first MCU movie I saw by the way was that Steve
seemed way more interested in joining the Army than being with girls it's easy to read this as him just being so darn
patriotic but it was actually extremely common for gay men in the first half of the 20th century to join the military
and all male environment seemed pretty appealing to a lot of gay men at the time even if you did run the risk of
getting shot by a Nazi but at least you'd die a hero instead of people back home finding out that you're a queer and
dying ashamed and alone there's also a hint of gay shame Steve feels like he's not good
enough not a real man and he wants so badly to be like everyone else that he's willing to go through a very risky
procedure to make it happen was this gay coding in the 1940s of
course not it was just a superhero origin story it may not be allegorical but it's certainly applicable which is
something that makes superheroes so Timeless no matter who you are no matter where or when you live you can project
yourself onto a superhero but I'm not here to say that Captain America and Bucky Barnes are
gay I'm here to say that the mcu's Captain America and Bucky burns are gay now of course Steve is madly in love
with Peggy Carter but look at the woman she's smart she's gorgeous she's a badass how could you not help but fawn
over her she's not just any woman she's one hell of an exceptional woman and also the obligatory love interest but
she's awesome so we'll ignore that you must have danced well that's going a woman to dance always seems so
terrifying in the past few years just didn't seem to matter that much figured
I'd wait for what right
partner interesting use of the word partner there could have said the right girl so
after Steve becomes Captain America Bucky is captured and presumed killed by Hydra the super Nazis and Steve goes out
to save him Bucky means the world to him and if there's even a chance of him being alive he's not going to lose him
cap Saves the Day of course and this tiny gesture I don't know it really caught my
attention the first time I saw the movie as they're escaping the facility begin begins to melt down but Bucky refuses to
leave without Steve eventually they both escape and the dynamic between them changes Steve is no longer the little
guy looking up to his Bud bucky bucky is now admiring Steve becoming his partner
fighting the Nazis with him until Bucky falls from a train into a frozen
European Wasteland below this breaks Steve the All-American man of men superhero breaks down into
tears the loss of Bucky he's seen so Much Death in this war so much Carnage so much loss but it's the loss of Bucky
that breaks him then Steve decides to die rather than be with Peggy and crashes a Nazi super plane into a
glacier where he's found a few decades later and resurrected because superheroes then in Winter Soldier we
find out that Bucky isn't dead he's been kept Alive by Hydra all this time and is
an assassin for them again because superheroes so while Steve is slowly acclimating to living in the 21st
century the return of Bucky shakes him to his core a part of his life he thought he'd
lost forever is back Steve's already seen Peggy but
she's not the Peggy he knew she's aged dying he still cares for her of course
but Bucky's the same age as Steve give or take he's like a memory plucked from the
past and placed smack dab in Steve's present like Steve he's a part of a
world that no longer exists so even though Bucky has been brainwashed and has the blood of hundreds of murdered
people on his hands Steve cannot bring himself to kill him not his Bucky not in
this world of a new millennium where being LGBT Isn't So frowned upon and maybe he and Bucky could be a real thing
Peggy even kind of gives Steve permission the world has changed
none of us can go back all we can do is our best and sometimes the best that we
can do is to start over and Bucky's the only person in this
whole wide crazy world that Steve feels he can really connect with though Bucky doesn't remember Steve and everyone
around him tells him Bucky needs to be taken down Steve refuses he hopes Beyond
hope that he can bring Bucky back not just to save Bucky but to save himself
to be not so alone after fighting in a doomed Helicarrier Steve backs off takes
off his helmet and bears his soul to Bucky literally dropping his shield something he hasn't done
before something that's only worth it because it's for Bucky he does this again in Civil War
literally and metaphorically letting his guard down for one person and one person
only when Bucky holds Steve's life in his hand about to land the killing
blow Steve tells him to do it then finish
it CU I'm with you to the end of the line Steve trusts Bucky even now in this
demented State he trusts him with his life and we can see in Bucky's eyes he's
remembering he's remembering his friend looking down into his face he sees someone he loves he can't kill him
and when Steve falls from the Helicarrier with Bucky Left Alive he could just let him fall and drown in the
water below but he saves him just like Steve saved him back in
World War II so even after being reprogrammed a 100 times by Hydra the
memory of his love for Steve is so strong platonic or romantic it doesn't matter their bond is so strong that he
overrides all of that programming and saves the most important person in the world to him Bucky disappears in Into
The Ether after that but Steve knows he's alive out there and he won't give up looking for him a mission that
culminates in Captain America Civil War in Civil War Steve is willing to let
the Avengers fall apart to save Bucky he's willing to let the might of the whole world come down on his shoulders
to save Bucky even after it's revealed that Bucky killed Tony's parents he
still won't let him go and by abandoning his shield he's even willing to leave the identity of Captain America America
behind because he doesn't need to be Captain America anymore he doesn't need to be an Avenger because he's got Bucky
so Steven Bucky love each other even Joe Russo the director of Civil War said so calling the movie a love story between
the two Heroes now you can say James they're just good friends these arguments often start out under the
guise of progressive thought making claims like they's so few examples of non-toxic masculinity and media so we
need more portrayals of a positive friendship between two men this sounds like a good argument at first until you think about it for a
minute or two and remember that almost all media is about male relationships and male friendships when it comes to
Captain America and Bucky Barnes specifically that well has been tapped quite thoroughly the relationship
between two men who fought alongside each other in a war has been the topic of many stories throughout Millennia
it's one of the most popular male friendship stories ever and why shouldn't that relationship go beyond just a friendship does it ruin the value
of the Friendship if it's also nonplatonic The Iliad story of Achilles
and Patrick's relationship should serve as an early Counterpoint here ideally
people in a relationship with one another would also be friends if the idea of characters being
in a relationship ruins that for you then perhaps you should think about why you feel that way and flip the coin for
a second say Bucky's a woman watching these movies seeing this relationship would you think for even a second that
these two people aren't going to end up together in the end really but of course
they don't because [ __ ] Disney and oddly enough the Stucky pairing would probably be the most
Disney friendly gay relationship they could have because fans of the proposed couple
aren't fans because of the expected sex sure there's plenty of porn online of the two of them if you're willing to go
look for it but that's not what draws people to them it's a bond between them it's a bond that lasts for decades
travels through time goes through Hellen back and yet in the end they're still dedicated to each
other it's a love story I don't even think it was done on purpose to be
honest unlike Teen Wolf and Sherlock I don't think the writers wrote this pairing or the actors played these parts
with the intent on baiting gays into loving them we were going to go see Chris Evans anyway it's just kind of
happened a natural outgrowth of the Chemistry Between the two actors playing
two characters that are innately drawn to one another I think it's a beautiful accident that can be read as either
platonic or romantic love the fact that so many gay people read it as being a
queer Love Story just shows how starved we are for representation in movies just
like in the days of queer coding we're willing to dig deep into our favorite media to find any hint of us possibly
being represented whether those golden nuggets are actually there or not but we
keep looking and looking someday hopefully very soon there will be a gold
rush even if right now we're only finding Fool's
Gold this video has been a long time coming I originally started working on it about a year ago and it was called
for the love of Stucky and was just a look at the Stucky relationship to say
it's grown a bit as a bit of an understatement uh I'm hoping to get
another video out oh maybe sooner than a year from now uh you can check out my patreon if you'd like to help out in the
production of these videos or just like share and subscribe nothing gets this
channel out there more than that you can also follow me on Twitter at Jor Summerton or check out my Community page
to vote on what video I'll be doing next so thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoyed this Beast of a video uh I will be back soon with more
content I promise so until then take care stay
