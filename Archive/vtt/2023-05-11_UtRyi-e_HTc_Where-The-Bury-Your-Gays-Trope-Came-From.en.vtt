00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
this video is brought to you by ag1 as
the film industry moved away from

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.720
Suburban Perfection the extensive
efforts made by Hollywood to conceal

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.920
homosexuality in film during the
post-war lavender scare era began to

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.539
deteriorate and then Hollywood came to
realize that they were ignoring a large

5
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.140
audience
no not gays at the time the lifeblood of

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.580
Hollywood was relationship dramas Disney
and fleisure cartoons and biblical epics

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
however they ultimately realized that a
group of Americans with disposable

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
income but little to spend it on was
being excluded

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.480
teenagers who were incensed to fight
back against their parents conservative

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.640
confining outlook on life this
rebellious nature spawned arguably the

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
most famous adolescent dissident film
ever made Rebel Without a Cause the film

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.940
contained broad Illusions to alternative
sexual behavior and the Alternatives

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
offered by gang ritualism Plato played
by salminio is the Loneliest and most

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.980
troubled of the three problematic
adolescents in the film the other two

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.640
being James Dean and Natalie Wood
although he is not accused of it Plato

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
was raised by a domineering housekeeper
in the absence of his father which at

17
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.880
the time was considered fertile breeding
ground for homosexuality Plato is a

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
multi-faceted character who challenges
traditional gender and sexuality Norms

19
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.360
he's a sensitive and artistic young man
who admires James Dean's gym and aspires

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180
to be like him their relationship is not
explicitly sexual but homoerotic tension

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
permeates it Plato's attraction to Jim
originates from his need for a mask role

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
model in his life who can offer him the
emotional support that he lacks at home

23
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.960
Jim is a troubled teenager who struggles
to blend in with his peers and family

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
nevertheless Jim's sensitivity and
emotional vulnerability contradict his

25
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.020
society's expectations of masculine
Behavior he is also drawn to Plato

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.180
despite being confined by the street
gang culture of the 1950s the writer of

27
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
the film Stuart stem said the gang in
Rebel Without a Cause isn't much

28
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.460
different from the Army both the rituals
are tribal the affection and gang

29
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.080
Behavior has to be hidden inside a
different vocabulary both spoken and

30
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.180
unspoken inside gestures and Words which
desensitized everything and made

31
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.099
everything brutal also they had to wear
skins to keep the image intact boots and

32
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.239
leather they had to put on a horse skin
in order to feel defended against the

33
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.780
discovery of their own Sensitivity I
don't know what other experiences in

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
World War II were but for us it was
deliberate and conscious

35
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.360
we were told that the buddy system
prevailed the choice of a buddy was as

36
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.379
or more critical than that of a bride
you'd be living in a kind of physical

37
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.459
intimacy which was unlike any other men
were having the experience of never

38
00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.239
having been so close to other men and
there was something of that love

39
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.140
operating within the structure of the
teenage gang whose members had left home

40
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.700
where there wasn't much love
to fight each other in the streets

41
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.959
fighting may have been a pretext for
being close and Rebel Without a Cause

42
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.519
when Jim and Buzz another gang
Associated teen decided to enter a

43
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.660
chicken race to the edge of a cliff a
race in which buzz will die the two

44
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.959
regard each other for a moment and
question their participation in such an

45
00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.220
event their encounter becomes the
motivation for all that follows Jim

46
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.840
refuses to deny his feelings and in the
screenplay stem uses the character's

47
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.700
guilt and grief over the death of Buzz
as a weapon against Conformity one of

48
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.720
the things I wanted to show in Rebel is
that underneath all the [ __ ] macho

49
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.819
defends there was that Pure Drive for
affection and didn't matter who the

50
00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.000
recipient might be
there was a longer time in those days

51
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.840
for young men to be in that Warrior
phase where a lot of romantic

52
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.340
attachments were formed before
heterosexual encounters happened my

53
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.700
favorite moment in the film is not
between Jim and Plato but between Jim

54
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.340
and Buzz who dies in the chicken race it
was tender and loving and the killing of

55
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
that boy whom Jim had known for all of
12 minutes motivated the entire last

56
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.680
half of the film additionally Rebel
Without a Cause challenges the

57
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.640
conventional gender roles of women in
society as well Natalie Wood portrays

58
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.299
Judy Jim's girlfriend who struggles to
find her position in a man's world

59
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.720
Judy's relationship with Jim is
complicated because they struggle to

60
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.500
express their emotions to one another
however Judy's character is also

61
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.759
noteworthy because she challenges
conventional Notions of femininity she

62
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.600
opposes the role of the passive
submissive woman in favor of asserting

63
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.100
her autonomy and agency the release of
pent-up emotions due to this type of

64
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.919
emotional repression is what ultimately
kills buzz and Plato while Jim is secure

65
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.300
in Judy's arms clearly adult
responsibilities include settling down

66
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.520
in a heterosexual relationship contrary
to the illusions of your teenage years

67
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.860
homosexuality is deemed ignorable
until the end of adolescence after that

68
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.720
it's considered a sort of sign of
Arrested Development as we entered the

69
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.520
latter half of the 1950s and beginning
of the 1960s this appeared to be

70
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.540
Hollywood's perspective on homosexuality
as well theoretically gay characters

71
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.300
could exist in Hollywood films but only
with one of two conclusions either they

72
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.860
straighten themselves out or they die
and Hollywood was not hesitant to make

73
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.300
films expressing this to the audience
burying your gaze in media has existed

74
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.100
for much longer than Twitter and Tumblr
may think but before we dive into

75
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.600
Hollywood's exploration a forced queer
trauma and film which is

76
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.479

98
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.060
TN sympathy is a classic example of
repression through coercion the play and

99
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.380
film have become so emblematic of the
traditional remedy for homosexuality

100
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.039
securing the love of a decent woman in
the nick of time that people have

101
00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:07.139
forgotten that it's actually a tale
about a timid heterosexual Robert

102
00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.280
Anderson who adapted his own play for
the big screen in 1956 employs the

103
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.340
classic Outsider archetype of the man
who marches to the beat of a different

104
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.139
drummer and must endure the ridicule of
his peers in neither the film nor the

105
00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:22.800
play as it ever suggested that the
sensitive student Tom Lee might prefer

106
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.539
men over women the issue at hand is the
allegation of homosexuality Lee's

107
00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:31.740
classmates Call Him Sister boy because
like Jim from Rebel Without a Cause he

108
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.479
refuses to run with the pack Tom prefers
Bach to baseball and the companionship

109
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:41.399
of his housemaster's wife Laura to touch
football his male tormentors disregard

110
00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.899
the fact that he is obviously in love
with the Elder woman because he does not

111
00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:51.060
fit the stereotypical male role in the
Vincent film the majority of the

112
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.920
accusatory remarks about homosexuality
were toned down Thomas found swimming

113
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.519
nude with a teacher who is also
suspected of being gay in the play in

114
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.060
the film he's labeled queer because he's
discovered stitching a button onto his

115
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.899
shirt while lounging on the seashore
with a group of Faculty spouses the

116
00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:10.200
suppressed homosexuality of Tom's
primary Tormentor the masculine

117
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.100
housemaster played by Leif Erickson who
married Laura to establish his

118
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.140
masculinity is also subdued in the film
adaptation Ericsson disregards Laura in

119
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.000
favor of the young male Macho pupils
that he instructs in Tea and Sympathy a

120
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.839
heterosexual youth is falsely accused of
homosexuality by adults whose sporting

121
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.339
activities provide the most homoerotic
action on screen Tom Blends in well as a

122
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:35.820
scapegoat Femme in the well-established
friendships between his classmates

123
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.100
therefore the film Advocates tolerance
not for sexual deviation but for

124
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.820
disadvantaged heterosexuals who are less
masculine never is homosexuality

125
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.899
considered a viable option for a genuine
man the message is that one cannot

126
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:53.040
presume a young man is homosexual solely
on the basis of his football performance

127
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.140
when Laura ultimately sleeps with Tom
she is not sparing him from a life of

128
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.940
sissiness but rather from his own fear
that his classmates may be correct about

129
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:09.120
his sexuality a fear that has already
led him to attempt suicide writer Robert

130
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.680
Anderson said to me it was never a play
about homosexuality when Leif Erickson

131
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.779
hounds Tom Lee he's really persecuting
what he fears in himself Tian sympathy

132
00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:23.339
which again was not about homosexuality
nevertheless served as a lesson for a

133
00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:28.740
generation of gay men who perceived Tom
Lee's tormentors pointed accusations not

134
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.899
as timid heterosexuals but as horrified
homosexuals the film was able to convey

135
00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:38.940
a portion of what actual homosexuals
felt and experienced in the 1950s while

136
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.779
staying faithful to the cultural
imperative of invisibility cultural

137
00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:46.560
necessity was of course in the hands of
the production code and there was never

138
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.279
any thought given to making the
homosexuality in NT and sympathy more

139
00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:54.180
overt in the film even the prospect that
someone could be gay in reality was

140
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.839
eliminated prior to the commencement to
filming Deborah Kerr wrote to Vincent

141
00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:02.399
Minnelli the Breen office is very
difficult about the homosexual angle

142
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:08.640
which is I understand their objection
adultery is okay impotence is okay but

143
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.440
perversion is their bet Noir in fact
adultery was not okay and so it came

144
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.980
under attack from the Catholic Legion of
decency anyway the already altered

145
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.740
ending of Tea and Sympathy had to be
made to reflect the necessary

146
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.240
retribution for Laura's affair with Tom
thus the finished movie taught that

147
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:30.360
instruction and initiation by an older
woman was a positive thing but that at

148
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.740
the same time such Behavior could not be
condoned at least not for the woman

149
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.420
Laura gives herself to Tom undoes the
top button of her blouse and says years

150
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:45.860
from now
when you talk about this

151
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.339
and you will

152
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:54.600
be kind
this is how the stage version concludes

153
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.600
the fall of the curtain left the
conclusion of the encounter to the

154
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.399
audience's imagination this however was
not good enough for Hollywood it filmed

155
00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:06.180
the seduction scene with a subdued
reverence reminiscent of a church

156
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.740
service the way the scene was filmed in
the woods with the birds chirping and

157
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.399
the special lighting made it appear more
like the second coming of Christ than

158
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.920
the first coming of Tom Lee a glaring
epilogue provides the morally correct

159
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.700
conclusion that makes the preceding
material acceptable to the Legion of

160
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.140
decency at his class reunion 10 years
later Tom wears the largest gold wedding

161
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.399
band ever observed up close on film
Tennessee Williams stepped up to the

162
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:37.740
plate to provide what became yet another
comment on the foreign gay twice

163
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.760
previously Williams's plays were adapted
for the big screen with significant

164
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.440
homosexual references removed in each
instance the adapters asserted that the

165
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.480
homosexual aspects of the play were not
needed from a dramatic point of view in

166
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.519
1951 the pro problem that Blanche Dubois
encountered with her husband was omitted

167
00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:01.139
from the film adaptation of A Streetcar
Named Desire in 1958 the homosexual

168
00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.579
implications in the relationship between
brick and the deceased Skipper were

169
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:09.839
removed from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in
both instances The Producers emphasized

170
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:16.139
that homosexuality was not the point and
was readily discarded in favor of more

171
00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:22.380
acceptable explanations then in 1959 two
years before the production code was

172
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.519
actually revised to permit homosexual
subject matter on screen

173
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:31.980
Suddenly Last Summer dealt with the
subject as a psychosexual circus act as

174
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.120
the 1950s almost demanded the
homosexuality of Sebastian Venable

175
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.620
Williams's condemned poet could be
inferred but not shown if the Breen

176
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.160
office granted special permission as a
consequence of the combination of

177
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.380
insanity and cannibalism the film had an
unpleasant sickly Ambiance that made

178
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.040
everyone involved approach it with
caution Catherine Hepburn who portrayed

179
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.660
Violet Venable Sebastian's deranged
mother publicly conveyed her disdain for

180
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.980
the topic Ken Geist the biographer of
director Joseph Vanquis claims that

181
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.320
mankowitz and Spencer Tracy spent the
greater part of an evening in Boston

182
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.440
explaining homosexuality to Catherine
Hepburn

183
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.880
but she flatly refused to believe that
such people existed she need not have

184
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.260
made such a commotion over Suddenly Last
Summer though in a meeting with producer

185
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.060
Sam Spiegel and screenwriter Gore Vidal
the Breen office eliminated all

186
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.339
references to homosexual relationships
Gore Vidal said my script was perfectly

187
00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:34.200
explicit
and then the Catholic Church struck the

188
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.060
Legion of decency after seeing that the
necessary Cuts were made gave the film a

189
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.800
special classification since the film
illustrates the horrors of such a

190
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:50.220
lifestyle it can be considered moral in
theme even though it deals with sexual

191
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.380
perversion it was resolved that
Sebastian Venable would not appear in

192
00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.899
person in the film according to Vidal he
was destined to be a glimmer an occasion

193
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:05.880
for memory with this decision Hollywood
had accomplished the unthinkable

194
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:12.000
it has portrayed an invisible gay man on
screen in the film Elizabeth Taylor's

195
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.079
character Catherine recounts how she and
Sebastian spent their days in a Spanish

196
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:20.880
Hamlet on the seashore and discloses
that Sebastian used her to seduce young

197
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.260
men Sebastian's efforts were effective
due to the boy's desperation for cash

198
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.980
however when he began to make
preparations for his departure to

199
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.620
Northern Europe Sebastian and Catherine
were accosted by a group of youths

200
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.480
pleading for money on a scorching day
when Sebastian rebuffed their advances

201
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.500
they pursued him through the city
streets Sebastian attempted to flee but

202
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.860
the boys followed him wherever he went
in the meantime Catherine had been

203
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.399
feverishly attempting to catch up to
Sebastian but when she finally did she

204
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:54.720
found him surrounded by men
Catherine claims that they tore

205
00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.300
Sebastian apart limb by limb
and ate him Henry Hart a film critic

206
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.079
discussed the origins of Suddenly Last
Summer in the January 1960 issue of

207
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:08.220
films in review it is said that
Tennessee Williams wrote Suddenly Last

208
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.079
Summer when a psychiatrist advised him
that for his own sake not to mention

209
00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:18.600
societies he had better stop denigrating
normality and begin to expose the evils

210
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.000
of homosexuality and its Allied forms of
Vice this Williams did

211
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.880
regardless of whether the advice
actually came from a therapist

212
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.160
Williams's tormented depiction of a
flailing homosexual artist and the

213
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.259
individuals he victimizes with his
aberrant impulses is a classic horror

214
00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:41.220
Tale the creature is finally destroyed
by an angry mob of Street Urchins in a

215
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.839
climax similar to that of James Wales
Frankenstein in which the peasants

216
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:50.820
pursue the monster to the top of a hill
where he is consumed by Flames what

217
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.339
emerged from Suddenly Last Summer was a
simple horror film with a budget a film

218
00:16:56.339 --> 00:17:01.620
with a high moral tone that was
ultimately unable to investigate its own

219
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.280
subject but even the overt mention of
homosexuality in a film starring

220
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.839
Catherine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor
shook the foundations on which the

221
00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.500
production codes aversion to
homosexuality stood the erosion of the

222
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.579
power of the production code to maintain
specific taboos had begun at the outset

223
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.679
of the 1950s and was only eroding
Evermore as time went on the California

224
00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:27.900
state Supreme Court ruled in early 1959
after analyzing a case involving a

225
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.760
screening of Kenneth anger's fireworks
that homosexuality is older than Sodom

226
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.559
and Gomorrah and is a legitimate subject
for screen treatment if handled properly

227
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:42.480
the ruling overturned the conviction of
an exhibitor who had been fined 250 and

228
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.120
sentenced to three years probation for
displaying the film fireworks in 1957.

229
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.280
variety referred to fireworks as an
attempt to convey through impressionism

230
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.419
the homosexual outlook on life in
general and noted that the court opinion

231
00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:03.600
stated that homosexuality is not to be
endorsed but Society must understand its

232
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.980
causes and effects after homosexuality
as a subject reached commercial film

233
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.600
houses seven years later Kenneth enger's
Scorpio Rising was eventually released

234
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.220
in theaters albeit specialized Art House
theaters such as New York's Bleaker

235
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.179
Street Cinema and caused a similar stir
once more the film was interpreted to

236
00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:25.380
symbolize homosexual life and attitudes
in General Andrew Saras drew a

237
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.160
homophobic conclusion after viewing
Scorpio rising in the Village Voice and

238
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.900
observing that anger Compares a depraved
homosexual orgy to footage from an

239
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.460
ancient film about the Life of Christ
why the parallel with Christ what else

240
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.660
is there for attractive homosexuals over
the age of 30 besides crucifixion the

241
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.020
treatment of fireworks and Scorpio
Rising by the courts Distributors and

242
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.120
critics indicated how the code would
ultimately evolve even in enlightened

243
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.679
circles homophobia was far too pervade
and unchallenged for homosexual themed

244
00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:59.880
films to be evaluated objectively based
solely on their cinematic Merit there

245
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.600
would be no recognition of the
legitimacy of gay subject matter only a

246
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.820
condescension to a an intermediate adult
audience Hollywood was determined to

247
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.419
reach without alienating the old fogies
Spartacus was one of the last commercial

248
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:16.020
films to have homosexuality expunged
from its script before the code was

249
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.580
amended in a scene between crassius and
his adolescent subordinate antoninus who

250
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.179
did not look like an adolescent the
elder man discreetly establishes his

251
00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:29.160
preference for both men and women do you
eat oysters when I have the master do

252
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.900
you eat snails
no master do you consider the eating of

253
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.059
oysters to be modeled and the eating of
snails to be immoral

254
00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:45.059
my taste includes
in both snails and oysters this exchange

255
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:49.440
was excised from the finished film
immediately followed by antoninus's

256
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.179
departure to join Spartacus and the
other slaves in Revolt what is therefore

257
00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:58.620
lost is any indication of antoninus's
dread of having a homosexual

258
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:04.080
relationship with crassius the fear that
causes antoninus to flee at that time so

259
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.380
it just kind of comes out of nowhere
such omissions prompted producers and

260
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.640
writers in the film industry to lament
that the code restricted their artistic

261
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.440
freedom and prevented Hollywood films
from competing in the mature marketplace

262
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.580
with foreign films that dealt with such
subject matters openly at the beginning

263
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.500
of the 1960s the prohibition against sex
perversion was the only specific

264
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.660
restriction on subject matter still in
place for movie censorship the merch

meticulously orchestrated campaign in
the summer of 1961 to prepare the public

267
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.320
for the inevitable they disclosed that
Wyler's second adaptation of Lillian

268
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.160
Hellman's play would restore lesbian
implications to the story which had been

confronted in a society that was still
primarily antagonistic toward them at

315
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.179
the time Senator Anderson is portrayed
as a sympathetic figure who struggles

316
00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:18.720
with the contradictions between his
private and public lives he is

317
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.820
conflicted between his responsibility as
a senator to safeguard the nation

318
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.559
and his desire to live an authentic
existence as a gay man the film

319
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:32.820
illustrates how his sexual orientation
could be used against him not only by

320
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.620
political adversaries but also by those
who sought to exploit his vulnerability

321
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.179
for personal gain in the end Anderson's
wife receives Anonymous phone messages

322
00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:46.740
from a man warning that if the
subcommittee does not report favorably

323
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.140

fellow Army veteran named Ray shaft
shaft confesses to selling evidence of a

326
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.460
previous gay relationship between the
two

327
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.260
leading
to Anderson suicide the film victim was

328
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.820
released the same year Melville Farr
played by Dirk Bogard appears to be a

329
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.360
successful London attorney in a loving
marriage but he conceals his sexual

330
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.539
orientation from everyone when his
ex-lover Barrett contacts him for

331
00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:26.159
assistance in paying off some
blackmailers he disregards his requests

332
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:29.640
Barrett has stolen money from his
employers and has been apprehended by

333
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:35.039
law enforcement knowing that his sexual
orientation would soon be revealed he

commits suicide in his jail cell Farr

take on the blackmailing organization
but each of the victims he approaches

336
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.179
refuses to assist preferring to pay the
money to keep their private lives hidden

337
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:52.620
knowing that Dirk Bogart himself lived
his life as a closeted gay man makes

338
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:57.480
victim all the more poignant from a
retrospective standpoint those who were

339
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.500
familiar with the industry at the time
claimed that his refusal to enter into a

340
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.059
marriage of convenience
hindered his prospects at a successful

341
00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:10.080
career in Hollywood Hollywood continued
to produce similar Works throughout the

342
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.000
1960s and Beyond despite widespread
criticism of these and other films that

343
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.020
perpetuated the barrier gaze Trope
numerous lgbtq plus activists and

344
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.860
Advocates viewed the trend as evidence
of a hostile broader cultural and

345
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.640
political climate towards the community
as a whole they argue that the Trope

346
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.600
contributed to a culture of dread and
shame surrounding queer identities and

347
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.919
reinforced detrimental stereotypes of
queer individuals as ill immoral and

348
00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:40.559
dangerous the practice however persisted
well into the New Millennium but there

349
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:44.940
was a faint glimmer of hope on the
horizon as the 60s came to a close with

350
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.600
the Stonewall uprisings ultimately
bringing the lives of gay people to the

351
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.620
attention of the general public and then
the gay inclusive x-rated Midnight

Cowboy won the Oscar for Best Picture
the Norms surrounding the depiction of

353
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.580
gay characters in film began to
disintegrate gay people could now exist

354
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.940
in Hollywood

355
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.419

thank all my patrons

358
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.799
comes to pushing queer content let alone
historical queer content in fact in most

359
00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.559

hidden
