00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
the rags to riches story is a classic
narrative Trope that has captured the

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.639
hearts of audiences for Generations one
of the most enduring and popular

3
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.099
variations of this tale is the story of
a nobody becoming a star

4
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.660
this narrative has been a staple of
Hollywood movies for almost a century

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.760
and it continues to resonate with
audiences to this very day the earliest

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.260
examples of this story in cinema can be
traced back to the silent film era in

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.820
1927 Warner Brothers released The Jazz
Singer about a young man who defies his

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.040
family's wishes and pursues a career in
Show Business the film was a box office

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.079
sensation and marked the emergence of
sound in Hollywood movies throughout the

10
00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
1930s and 40s Hollywood produced a
string of films that featured the rags

11
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.320
to riches narrative perhaps the most
famous of these is a star is born which

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.239
was first released in 1937 and has been
remade multiple times since then

13
00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.940
starring the likes of Janet Gaynor Judy
Garland Barbra Streisand and Lady Gaga

14
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.100
as Hollywood left the studio era behind
in the 1970s we saw a shift towards

15
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
gritty realistic dramas but the rags to
Rich's narrative continued to be popular

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.640
one notable example was the rocky series
the films tell the story of Rocky Balboa

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.119
a struggling boxer from Philadelphia who
gets a shot at the heavyweight

18
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.119
championship
through hard work and determination

19
00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.420
Rocky becomes a hero to millions in the
1980s and 1990s Hollywood began to

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.259
produce more movies that focused on
individual achievement and the American

21
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.360
dream with movies like 1983's Flash
Dance about a young woman who dreams of

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
becoming a professional dancer and 1990s
pretty woman about a sex worker who's

23
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.380
hired by a wealthy businessman who then
Falls madly in love with her rags to

24
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
Rich's storylines are important to
people because they provide a message of

25
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.299
Hope and inspiration
emphasize the value of hard work and

26
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.340
resilience and offer a form of escapism
from the challenges of everyday life by

27
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.140
depicting the Journey of a character who
starts from humble beginnings and

28
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.520
achieves great success
these stories tap into some of the most

29
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.920
fundamental desires and aspirations that
people have and provide a powerful

30
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.200
reminder that anything is possible with
the right mindset and the right amount

31
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.000
of effort and that's why we're going to
explore the epitome of Rags to Riches

32
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.760

can of doggy Chow do you find cooking

35
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920

overwhelming

well hellofresh's pre-proportioned

[Music]
thank you lights

58
00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.460
other lights
there we go good evening girls and Bros

59
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.759
and non-binary hoes and welcome to the
main room of the Stardust Hotel and

60
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.720
Casino my name is James and I'll be your
MC for this evening of sexy

61
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.340
scintillating ladies and Macho super
jocks but

62
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.259
before we get to tonight's entertainment
I'd like to talk to you about these guys

63
00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.580
and gals in some detail
so that you know what kind of a show

64
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.560
you're in for
starting with the famous ladies of the

65
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.259
infamous film
Showgirls make no mistake Showgirls is

66
00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.419
many people's favorite movie there are
entire conventions dedicated to it with

67
00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.280
drag queens donning their feather boas
and throwing on Southern Accents and

68
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.419
flashing out tasseled nipples at the
slightest provocation regardless of the

69
00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.180
fact that there are not in fact any
tasseled nipples in Showgirls following

70
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.199
the movie's release in box office bomb
The Producers managed to turn a profit

71
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.460
off of the cult fan base via home video
Collector's Editions midnight screenings

72
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.479
touring the cast for autographs and
selling related merchandise the movie

73
00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.280
since it went to video and DVD has more
than turned a profit and is now fondly

74
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.100
compared to the worst of the worst bad
movies like the room and troll 2.

75
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.020
but with boobies when most people say
they like show Girls they're usually

76
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.520
quick to say that they like it
ironically there are some people who do

77
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.020
earnestly think that it's a good story
with amazing performances but we're not

78
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.520
going to talk about them there's also
usually gay people in the mix who adore

79
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.860
the amount of intended and unintended
camp that exists in this film but most

80
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.960
have again an ironic love of Showgirls
they're drawn to the absurdism of it

81
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.699
they watch it and they see a complete
failure of Direction in every way they

82
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.259
see Elizabeth Berkeley doing whatever it
is that she's doing they see a gruesome

83
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.880
carnivalesque car accident of everything
in a movie that could go wrong

84
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.940
going worse they see a failure to meet
basic expectations so dire that you

85
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.740
can't look away
for these reasons we love show Girls we

86
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.660
are drawn to this movie because of all
these terrible elements it's hilarious

87
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.240
to see such an egregious failure and
make no mistake showgirls

88
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.919
is bad
like it's awful the acting ranges from

89
00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:43.319
nuanced to unhinged and in Gina
gershon's case she dances on a thin line

90
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.880
between the two of them the plot is
Loosely strung together composed of

91
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.840
essentially every single Trope found in
A Star is Born movies everything is

92
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.120
bombastic and dialed up to an 11 for the
entire film there is no point of slowing

93
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.400
down however
in Vegas at a roulette table winning off

94
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.360
of a hundred Reds in a row is just as
improbable as losing to Black a hundred

95
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.599
times
but this movie pulls it off somehow

96
00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:16.500
hitting so many perfectly bombastic
overuse boring and only in the movies

97
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.680
plot tropes in perfect sequence can't
just be a matter of some of the most

98
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.460
competent and celebrated filmmakers of
the time

99
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.099
turning a blind eye to all of the other
ridiculous things that for some reason

100
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:36.180
landed on the screen
surely

101
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.380
someone in a suit and
Ty would have looked at some of the

102
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.660
pre-production rehearsals and said
you know what maybe Paula Abdul can't

103
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.320
dance even outside of how many people
will behind the camera were seasoned

104
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.760
Hollywood veterans after watching the
movie itself enough times you begin to

105
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.140
pick up on little patterns there's
something about Showgirls that other bad

106
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.940
movies just don't seem to have troll to
the room and any number of Camp horror

107
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.500
movies they tend to run out of steam
about halfway to two-thirds in they're

108
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.519
just not fun to watch anymore they draw
from a certain number of tricks and

109
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:15.660
sensibilities and after a while the
audience gets diminishing returns okay

110
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.980
cool Tommy Wiseau is doing Tommy Wiseau
things just like he did those same

111
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.300
things earlier in the movie it's
actually incredibly difficult to

112
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.480
deliberately create bad movies the
examples we Elevate are accidents the

113
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.680
room was intended to be a brilliant
Masterpiece with a Madman with too much

114
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.620
money at the helm Troll 2 was just uh
a lot

115
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.480
a lot of confusion because

116
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.800
movies that try to be bad by parodying
tropes in a genre usually run into the

117
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.680
aforementioned problem where they run
out of material before they've hit their

118
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.940
feature length or they become
predictable they conform to their own

119
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.220
format a little too insecure to keep
finding ways to flip the script it's why

120
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.019
Monty Python movies still hold up
comedically The Comedy troupe finds ways

121
00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:16.800
to keep you guessing until the very end
they just keep throwing things at you

122
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.880
you never have time to pay attention to
something that's not funny on the flip

123
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.540
side there is an abundance of movies
that are

124
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.320
technically
perfect and I mean that from a technical

125
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.160
standpoint they are perfect the
cinematography gives depth the editing

126
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.399
is tight they've got A-list actors
giving the performances of their lives

127
00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:40.320
the script is dripping with pathos
but for some reason they're just not

128
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.640
engaging and you can watch Modern
Spielberg with rose tinted glasses and

129
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.779
you can find a great movie in there if
you want but it doesn't capture the je

130
00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:53.220
ne sais quoi elements of how he just
stopped making movies that are

131
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.820
interesting to watch the difficult thing
when debating lifelong Spielberg fans is

132
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.260
that their idea of his modern works are
so colored by his early career that they

133
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.260
ignore the non-qualifiable elements of
is this movie engaging because engaging

134
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.040
isn't really anything that you can
reduce to a matter of technique or a

135
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.000
checklist of must-haves whether
something is engaging or not is less a

136
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.480
matter of technique and more a matter of
artistic taste

137
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.740
which is something that cannot be
learned but can be fostered and can be

138
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:32.339
lost the showgirls
show Girls is definitely engaging if

139
00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:36.240
nothing else and unlike a slew of other
Star Wars Christmas specials there's

140
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.899
never really that point in Showgirls
where it stops giving something new to

141
00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.560
the next scene it's closer in
sensibilities to Rocky Horror which

142
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.060
spits everything at you at such a
dizzying pace that you don't even

143
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.380
realize that the cast retires for the
night has some sex and after Susan

144
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.640
Sarandon distracts us with an acid trip
sex scene for some reason we are

145
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.200
gathered at a dinner table having like a
four course dinner what's the matter

146
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.160
Columbia it's not like you've never had
meatloaf before but the argument here

147
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.019
isn't that Showgirls is ironically
fantastic I honestly have come to the

148
00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:15.440
belief the Showgirls is unironically
a masterpiece of Cinema specifically

149
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.440
because it's intended to be a showcase
of Badness but in order to distinguish

150
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.140
what I mean by an ironic appreciation of
Showgirls we really need to sit down and

151
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.880
talk about irony itself
because in this post-jagged little pill

152
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.339
Alanis Morissette world we live in irony
has become one of the most overused and

153
00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:44.180
misunderstood words in all of the
English language

154
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:55.019
[Music]
many people who say that something is

155
00:12:55.019 --> 00:13:00.120
ironic probably are referring to
something that is coincidental or

156
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.800
something that seems vaguely literary as
it happens in real life this leads

157
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.100
people to believe that irony has a fluid
and interchangeable meaning which

158
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.620
results in the word being thrown into
random sentences to sound academic like

159
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.060
an undergraduate who has to fill out a
word count or a right-wing talk show or

160
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.500
podcast host clearly though irony has an
incredibly specific set of uses vaguely

161
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.740
when something is ironic it means what
happens occurs in spite of the events

162
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.500
that were meant to lead to it an example
of something ironic is actually a 1996

163
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.639
indie rock song deliberately outlining
the number of fake ironies and then

164
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:42.660
becoming so popular that it causes a
shift in the cultural awareness of irony

165
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.800
while fans of the song are entirely
unaware that a song called ironic does

166
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.000
not contain any actual ironies Alanis
Morissette's song actually outlines a

167
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.959
number of coincidences isn't it ironic
that a song called ironic does not

168
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:59.579
contain anything ironic the difference
between irony and a coincidence is that

169
00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:03.360
a coincidence describes two instances
which occur in spite of each other an

170
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.100
irony to describes a single outcome that
subverts preceding events or information

171
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.300
irony cannot be coincidental as a matter
of fact because the outcome happens

172
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.980
specifically because of an effort taken
to ensure it would not happen in order

173
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.360
for more sets line it's like rain on
your wedding day to be ironic you would

174
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.420
have needed to plan your wedding in a
part of the world with almost no

175
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.500
precipitation in a time of the year
where precipitation is additionally

176
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.639
uncommon only for it to rain anyway
while your hometown of Seattle

177
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:36.839
Washington has a solid week of sunshine
but this is only one kind of irony there

178
00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:41.040
are actually three different specific
ways that irony can exist the first as

179
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.300
demonstrated and most commonly misused
is situational irony raining every day

180
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.139
on your vacation only for the sun to
shine the day that you leave is classic

181
00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:53.760
but this symbolism and foreshadowing are
some of the oldest literary devices in

182
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.560
history one of the greatest ironies in
all of literature is Sophocles Oedipus

183
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.279
tyrannus which many people know is the
story of a guy who kills his dad to [ __ ]

184
00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:08.579
his mom popularized by by the
pseudo-scientific and Incredibly skewed

185
00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:14.100
research of Sigmund Freud Sophocles told
the story of Oedipus who in an

186
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.600
unnecessarily complicated Cascade of
time jumps and people stepping on stage

187
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.560
and saying but wait you don't know the
whole story Oedipus is the prince of

188
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.139
Corinth who once asked the Oracle of
Delphi who his birth parents were she

189
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:32.279
replied that he would kill his father
and marry his mother obviously put off

190
00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:37.139
by this thereafter he vows to never
return to Corinth so he would not kill

191
00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:41.639
his father so he decides to travel to
Thebes and gets in an argument with an

192
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:46.139
anonymous wealthy man at a Crossroads a
fight breaks out and Oedipus kills the

193
00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:50.579
other man he then instead marries
jocosta the recently widowed queen of

194
00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:55.260
Thieves which
seriously this is the guy who solved the

195
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.339
riddle of the Sphinx and he can't figure
out what happened to the recently

196
00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:03.480
murdered King of Thieves or that maybe
if you're prophesied to sleep with your

197
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.260
mother maybe avoid older women in
general and the way we get around this

198
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.100
plot hole is by Oedipus withholding
information from the audience until the

199
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.459
third act I don't know
sounds like it needs to get workshopped

200
00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:18.480
a bit in spite of oedipus's inability to
put two and two together we learned that

201
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.279
he was adopted by the royal family of
Corinth and was actually born to jocosta

202
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:27.360
in Thebes and the man he killed at the
crossroads which he was only traveling

203
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.779
specifically because he was trying to
escape his fate was actually his father

204
00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:35.699
the irony here is that oedipus's
decision to avoid his fate is what led

205
00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:39.600
him to do exactly what the Oracle said
he would do

206
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.740
the additional layer of situational
irony is that Freud named his Oedipus

207
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.920
complex to describe a boy who wants to
remove his father and sleep with his

208
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.199
mother when the point of Oedipus is how
desperately he didn't want to do this he

209
00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:56.220
wasn't weird meanwhile why does nobody
give the Oracle of Delphi the credit she

210
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.000
deserves [ __ ] given 10th dimensional
Chess Championship semi-finalists here

211
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.779
next year average anime teenage villain
so yeah that was situational irony

212
00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:08.760
events influence and outcome though the
outcome subverts the expectations the

213
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.079
next most well-known instance of irony
is dramatic irony dramatic irony is

214
00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.280
typically used in theater or more
recently visual mediums like film and

215
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.760
television this is where the audience is
made aware of how the story is going to

216
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.980
end before the Story begins which
Oedipus tyrannus is another example of

217
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.679
but this isn't to be confused with
foreshadowing where within the

218
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:36.840
literature itself there is an indication
of what is to come foreshadowing occurs

219
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.740
in a way where the characters
hypothetically could be be made aware of

220
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.280
future events with varying degrees of
subtlety this doesn't always need to be

221
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.980
a narrative prologue which directly
tells the audience what's going to

222
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.299
happen dramatic irony to use another
Shakespearean example for which all of

223
00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:55.559
our high school teachers drilled into US
is Romeo and Juliet which not only is

224
00:17:55.559 --> 00:18:00.539
probably one of his worst plays but
evidenced by the fact that he thought so

225
00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:04.320
little of the play's contents that he
opened it up with a prologue that

226
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.320
literally tells the audience that they
can leave if they want without missing

227
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.100
much gone are the days when people watch
TV and movies to actually watch them

228
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.200
instead of just the one-time instant
gratification serotonin Rush of gasping

229
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.980
at the obvious interchangeable plot
twists that you've seen in 20 other

230
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.480
movies back in my day we used to have
more reasons to watch movies than just

231
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.280
to be surprised for two minutes no
seriously spoiler culture has destroyed

232
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.419
the use of dramatic irony you get people
these days who refuse to watch movie

233
00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:37.020
trailers because they spoil the story
let alone that the plot is only one

234
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.400
component of any dramatic media the
audience goes into the play aware that

235
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.900
both Romeo and Juliet die
before they even meet them likely

236
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.700
because the first three acts are just so
Piney that he needed some indication to

237
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.240
let the audience know that it wasn't
just romantic drivel it was romantic

238
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.200
drivel with double suicide it was
entirely constructed to project the

239
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.720
message that young love is dumb how
ironic is it that we consider it a great

240
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.280
love story today dramatic irony doesn't
need to be literary either James

241
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.240
Cameron's Titanic is dramatically ironic
because you literally walked into the

242
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.780
theater knowing the ship's gonna sink
you know what's going to happen

243
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.520
the characters do not the third type of
irony and one we don't usually

244
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.100
acknowledge is irony is a verbal irony
or more popularly known as satire this

245
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.820
is where the phrasing in syntax used in
a work do not align with the actual

246
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.380
intentions of the author through the use
of other literary devices often the

247
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.340
carnivalesque or exaggeration the
Creator's intent is made clear this is

248
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.960
the case with Jonathan Swift's satirical
essay a modest proposal in which he

249
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.440
details a solution to the famine in
Ireland where the government enacts

250
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.220
emissive for the Irish to cannibalize
their unwanted Catholic infants this

251
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.140
wood he said solve three problems food
shortage overpopulation and affording

252
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.500
poor families a source of income by
selling their babies to meat producers

253
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.299
boom check check check but here's the
thing Swift himself was Irish and in the

254
00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:07.500
language of English intellectual
arguments of the day he dismisses other

255
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.539
plausible easy solutions to famine and
poverty in Ireland

256
00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:17.880
this is a satirical parody of the
political and academic justifications of

257
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.380
Cruelty instead he raises a claim so
absurd that it seems completely

258
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.280
unrealistic while highlighting the
lengths that the English Parliament will

259
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.980
go to instead of finding any other
feasible solution to a food shortage a

260
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.700
difficulty When approaching verbal irony
or satire is the non-qualifiable element

261
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.440
of taste as mentioned in other videos
and will be mentioned again satire has a

262
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.240
considerable risk of being too subtle
and thus can be read as supporting the

263
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.960
very thing that it intends to ridicule
in which case I have an argument to say

264
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.280
the Showgirls itself qualifies as verbal
irony for reasons that I fully intend on

265
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.900
explaining in gratuitous detail if it's
true and the entire point of Showgirls

266
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:03.419
is to make you see how bad it is then
those who love Showgirls ironically

267
00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:06.539
for the entertainment value of seeing a
terrible movie

268
00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:10.380
are actually appreciating Showgirls for
the exact reason it was meant to be

269
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.679
consumed
so if you say you love show Girls

270
00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:18.720
ironically
you're actually unironically conforming

271
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.640
to the Cinematic experience that Paul
verhoven wanted to give to you

272
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.380
and to the rest of us who admire it
unironically

273
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.720
we're the actual ironic ones you know
because that's how irony works

274
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.820
satire
things aren't what you would like

275
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.799
expect them to be
subverted and

276
00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:49.980
stuff yeah irony but it's quite a claim
to take a movie that's bad and say that

277
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.820
not only is it so bad that it's good but
that it's a masterpiece because it's

278
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.960
meant to be so bad that it can't not be
good

279
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:05.059
such a bold claim is going to require
some very bold evidence

280
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:21.179
[Music]
before we talk about Showgirls itself we

281
00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:24.780
need to justify my claim about seasoned
Hollywood veterans behind the camera

282
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:30.000
because when it comes to well-respected
directors it's not uncommon that they

283
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.500
make a bad movie so in that case it
usually is just boring or forgettable

284
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.900
but if we look at Trends in Hollywood
it's actually much less likely that an

285
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.460
incredibly competent and well-paid team
could fail to the point of making

286
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:50.700
something that spectacularly bad then
going out of one's way to make something

287
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.720
that's spectacularly bad on purpose
director Paul verhoven actually is

288
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.559
responsible for several other films from
the pre-millennial era of Hollywood

289
00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:05.100
which to this day continue to be held up
and even turned into memes specifically

290
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.900
I want to take a look at Basic Instinct
Robocop and Starship Troopers and while

291
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.760
Basic Instinct sets a
strange gold bar for murder mystery cop

292
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.320
dramas and is relevant to Showgirls
specifically both Robocop and Starship

293
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.120
Troopers established fairhoven as a
master satirist in the case of Robocop

294
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.559
and Troopers they ought to be used as
examples of the use of framing devices

295
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:34.200
to completely subvert the content of the
film in either instance the scripts

296
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.700
themselves are of very little substance
aside from intending to be mass-market

297
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.240
crowd-pleasing action movies however in
this process verhoven completely

298
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.600
subverts the written content and spoken
word of his visual cues and getting

299
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.960
especially specific performances from
his actors in the case of a visual cue

300
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.340
certain scenes or the entire film are
established One Way permitting a

301
00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.299
sarcastic interpretation of the events
in the instance of performances an actor

302
00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:05.700
May evoke certain references from their
line delivery alone this is a specially

303
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.360
important for Starship Troopers the plot
of Starship Troopers is nothing special

304
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.640
nothing you wouldn't get out of your
average Army movie originally written as

305
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.380
what was considered a coming-of-age
novel by Robert a Heinlein while on one

306
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.580
hand it was praised for its sequences of
training and combat it was very divisive

307
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.200
in nature heineland's very deliberate
show of support for violent military

308
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.460
campaigns was met with criticisms that
echoed The public's fatigue of ongoing

309
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.559
conflict in Vietnam that didn't seem to
have a clear goal or end point the use

310
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:42.720
of military and War in a coming-of-age
novel is also a real wholesome boys

311
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.460
becoming mankana story right the story
is problematic and even at the time

312
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.419
there were some raised eyebrows which in
conjunction with the novel's politics

313
00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:56.100
about who is not worthy of being a
citizen have left a relatively tarnished

314
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.720
Legacy for the story heinlin himself was
inspired to write this novel when in

315
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.760
1958 America announced a suspension of
all nuclear arms testing he apparently

316
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.900
felt that America faced too much of a
threat to just be wide open like that

317
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.960
what if a race of semi-sentient bug
people were to attack how would America

318
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.679
defend itself then so he wrote a book
about it which in itself has a kind of

319
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:23.760
Clueless Ridiculousness about it on one
hand Heinlein wanted to write a book

320
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.039
where the American I mean I mean human
where the human way of life is under

321
00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:32.820
threat of annihilation by the Menace of
sentient murderbugs on the other hand

322
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.840
Heinlein really wanted to depict the
kind of futuristic Utopia that he felt

323
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.000
mankind would only attain
through a fascist State he depicts our

324
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.779
leaders as unilaterally virtuous and
trustworthy furthermore the only

325
00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:49.380
citizens who have a right to vote or
participate in Civic discussion are

326
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.919
those who have worked within the
government almost exclusively in the

327
00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:56.340
military
so what happens when you give what is by

328
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.900
almost all accounts a proto-fascist
narrative that is so celebratory of the

329
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.679
military that there's a strong case to
describe it as a recruitment tool to a

330
00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:09.299
Dutch director who watched the Nazis
take over his country

331
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:13.500
you get a space Nazi recruitment film
that's what you get as if the Aryan

332
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.159
poster boy who goes through the trials
of war and doubt to shut off the Flippin

333
00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:22.740
Boyhood to become a grizzled yet
dazzlingly handsome leader among men was

334
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.460
not convincing enough we get Neil
Patrick Harris as a psychic officer and

335
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.960
an SS Overcoat verhoven seems to take
the recruitment meta text of the book

336
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.580
and incorporate it into the text of his
film where there are Fascist elements he

337
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.860
draws inspiration from Lenny Riefenstahl
but at the same time very subtly makes a

338
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.240
mockery of these characters and their
problems and when in doubt showcase an

339
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.679
absurd number of shots of these space
fascists dying in droves against these

340
00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:52.740
aliens because they don't have the power
armor that they had in the book however

341
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.059
there is an additional layer to this
movie which is the opening and closing

342
00:26:57.059 --> 00:27:02.580
sequence the I'm doing my part too is a
meme that sees frequent usage on the

343
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.580
internet in conjunction with the closing
sequence where the three primary

344
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.080
characters basically look at the camera
and say enlist today really work to

345
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.539
frame this entire film as enlistment
propaganda that would exist in a

346
00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:19.440
universe where humanity is embroiled in
a conflict against giant murder bugs in

347
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.240
space and really
especially when it comes down to Johnny

348
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.020
every area and over here
he goes through the stages of a

349
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.400
Whimsical desire to serve his country
questioning and doubting his own

350
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.400
leadership making trauma-bonded friends
and learning the hard way how to make

351
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.000
tough choices it really does establish a
flattering expectation of armed services

352
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.380
in conjunction with his two other high
school friends who were also military

353
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.720
bound we are shown that there are more
ways than one to serve one's country I

354
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.200
mean planet the overwhelming majority of
satirical elements though are from

355
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.200
visual cues and performances when it
comes to the majority of Hollywood

356
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.679
executives
that's a little too subtle for them to

357
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:05.220
pick up on with their little business
degrees the film was marketed as a

358
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.120
straightforward cut and dry Sci-Fi
Action Movie trailers for the film make

359
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.779
no attempt to display any kind of
satirical intent this is something that

360
00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:18.720
was fairly common in many verhoven films
particularly his action movies as

361
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.600
Billy from their depictions in the
trailers they can be sold as

362
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.520
straightforward action movies but have a
little bit more substance than other

363
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.120
films in the same genre while Starship
Troopers maybe verhoven's greatest

364
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.220
example of scathingly sarcastic
condemnation of his own source material

365
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:40.260
RoboCop is his best example of genre
criticism so unapparent

366
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.940
that it can pass for the media it's
actually trying to subvert again set in

367
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.380
a science fiction Universe RoboCop is
the kind of Bionic Man story that you

368
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.880
would expect a cop is killed in the line
of duty and after being reconstructed as

369
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.200
a cyborg begins to get flashes of his
old life and then goes on a Revenge

370
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.559
Quest against the human people who
killed him holy [ __ ] is that the dad

371
00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:04.460
from That 70s Show

372
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.460
at a glance RoboCop seems to be your
run-of-the-mill cop movie but he's a

373
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.700
robot the city of Detroit is so crime
ridden that officers can regularly

374
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.240
expect their buddies to die in the line
of duty being an officer is more about

375
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.740
saying badass lines to the queer-coated
bad guys and the corporate bad guys to

376
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.539
whom they are secretly employed not to
be confused with the corporate good guys

377
00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:32.159
who will benefit from having the icky
corporate Executives unceremoniously

378
00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:36.600
removed on a level deeper
the film is about excessive police

379
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.000
violence officers are depicted treating
their firearms like toys and take

380
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.200
apparent Delight in opportunities to use
them police officers put themselves in

381
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.240
situations where they need to use Force
instead of say due process and

382
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.279
investigation when police officers die
the force uses this as justification for

383
00:29:56.279 --> 00:30:01.740
requiring greater armaments leading to
the bad guys acquiring more Firepower

384
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.299
for themselves on a deeper level the
film speaks as a cautionary tale of the

385
00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:10.799
kind of world this police state arms
race will generate spliced in between

386
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:15.240
the narrative are a number of newsreels
where anchors give a brief synopsis of

387
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.840
the state of the world functionally
these newsreels give the audience an

388
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.940
idea of how the public reacts to police
crime and the introduction of the first

389
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.840
cybernetic officer both Robocop and
Starship Troopers demonstrate Paul

390
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.520
verhoven's ability to create a narrative
which can deceive audiences and

391
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.899
producers into believing a film project
is one thing when it's actually another

392
00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:41.520
in spite of his satirical Tendencies
verhoven does manage to pull off serious

393
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.299
fiction very well working on projects
that earned him a heap of Hollywood cred

394
00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:49.799
namely his other titso cocaine snorting
bisexual demonizing wacky waving

395
00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:55.159
inflatable tube orgasming psychological
Thriller Basic Instinct which bears and

396
00:30:55.159 --> 00:31:00.320
outstanding connection
to show Girls

397
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.559
from what I can gather Showgirls was
intended to recreate the magic of Basic

398
00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:18.600
Instinct but bigger Basic Instinct was
small in scope a psychological ROM

399
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.539
through sex and conflicts of interest in
the police force which was a big hit and

400
00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:27.960
even though Studios may have thought it
was because the audience got a front row

401
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.340
view of Sharon Stone snatch iconic the
film itself was an engaging and

402
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.000
methodical case study in gaslighting the
audience the key here was engaging

403
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.960
performances from everyone involved
Beyond sharing verhoven is the director

404
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.000
of these films also have the same writer
Joe esterhaus being able to navigate the

405
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.200
twists and turns in this whodunis when
the who is abundantly clear and yet even

406
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.279
the audience begins to doubt themselves
takes a strong narrative Direction this

407
00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:57.840
movie made an absurd amount of money
especially for a hard R rating and

408
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.799
surely not all of that could be credited
to the sex in order to really sell the

409
00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:04.760
story to the audience everyone else
needs to be on top of their game

410
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.240
estherhas also wrote the script for
Flashdance which helped cement him is

411
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.659
Hollywood's naked lady go-to guy the
surge in popularity of high-profile

412
00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:16.559
erotic Thrillers was drawing the eye of
upper level Hollywood Executives and

413
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:20.340
they wanted to take the Acclaim of Basic
Instinct and push it even further the

414
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.360
primary draw to Basic Instinct may have
been the strongly provocative sex scenes

415
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.520
but the real dramatic pull was the
chemistry between Michael Douglas and

416
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.279
Sharon Stone who plays Catherine tremel
is an heiress and an author involved in

417
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:38.700
a gruesome murder as the victim's
girlfriend one of her novels also

418
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.779
depicts the murder scene in perfect
detail right down to the ice pick she

419
00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:46.320
also has other novels depicting murders
that she is linked to while it seems

420
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.700
that Catherine is the obvious suspect
she has everyone wrapped around her

421
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.779
finger through the process of seduction
even the audience questions whether she

422
00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:58.559
actually did it or not we may be
inclined to wonder how a writer could go

423
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:04.260
from Basic Instinct
to show Girls however to be honest there

424
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.520
was a lot about Basic Instinct which
from a writing perspective would be red

425
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:14.220
flags things there seem to just happen
which are nonsensical except to fit

426
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.820
certain dramatic beats namely the
dramatic relationship between Douglas's

427
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.620
homicide detective Nick Curran and
police psychologist Dr Beth Garner after

428
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.880
Corrine was put under investigation for
shooting two tourists he had to undergo

429
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.659
therapy sessions with Garner where they
also began seeing each other

430
00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:36.840
romantically even while Curran was still
her patient which is an ethical cluster

431
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.039
and while the film makes no attempt to
flatter the sfpd there is a certain

432
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:45.000
suspension of disbelief needed to take
this seriously especially as it's made

433
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.320
clear that the other officers gossip
that kurin only started dating Dr Garner

434
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.940
to get off the hook there are also a few
other minor plot holes or dropped beats

435
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.880
the kind that exists in almost every
movie that you don't pay attention to

436
00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.380
however as I said about suspension of
disbelief the audience remains engaged

437
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.640
regardless because the performances of
the actors are selling you a world in

438
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.260
which this chain of events is possible
we can dismiss the breaches of Ethics as

439
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.399
a self-aware criticism of corruption in
the police force we can dismiss the

440
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:18.540
dropped beats as an additional layer of
doubt that the audience is meant to Come

441
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.379
Away with provided the talent in front
of the camera with the chemistry between

442
00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:25.619
Stone and Douglas especially
shortcomings in the material can be

443
00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:30.540
excused because you are so engaged in
what the film is doing well

444
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.919
that you don't notice when it's not
Landing verhoven's initial cut would

445
00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:38.879
have actually gotten Basic Instinct in
NC-17 rating the release cut was about

446
00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:42.720
45 seconds shorter and swapped out
different shots to obscure the explicit

447
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.139
elements no doubt this was at the
Studio's insistence but the seed was

448
00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:50.520
planted if it was okay to make an NC-17
movie how much more could a studio get

449
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.040
away with showing all they needed was
one genuinely great NC-17 film to open

450
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.220
the floodgates
which brings us

451
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.960
to Showgirls there's a movie that's
creating quite a buzz in Hollywood these

452
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.339
days not only because of its racy
content but also because its director is

453
00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:12.740
hoping it will receive the very rating
that usually means box office death

454
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.880
NC-17 so there was a lot riding on the
idea of the film that would become show

455
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.579
girls even if the script didn't exist
yet and as it so happened esterhaus

456
00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:27.960
pitched the idea of a Las Vegas story
about the corruption of Fame to Paul

457
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.640
verhoven and wrote it down on a napkin
the idea of the duo behind Basic

458
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.619
Instinct collaborating on this project
was something everyone in Hollywood

459
00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:43.380
wanted in on every major Studio made
bids on Esther haas's pitch resulting in

460
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:48.780
an idea that went to auction and landed
a 2 million dollar advance in the early

461
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.800
90s when the film went into production
he was paid another 1.7 million dollars

462
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.119
for the finished script MGM wanted to
recreate the magic of Basic Instinct and

463
00:35:57.119 --> 00:36:02.220
they were pulling out all the stops and
so it is in spite of being surrounded by

464
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.280
some of the most renowned character
actors of the day that Elizabeth

465
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.560
Berkeley was doing this
and Elizabeth Berkeley is no Sharon

466
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.880
Stone with no Sharon Stone and so the
audience has no reason to take for

467
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.119
granted that any of the weird elements
of Showgirls are happening on purpose

468
00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:22.560
instead it's all part of the hurricane
of pure chaos that occupies the majority

469
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.880
of screen time in Showgirls and so all
the little questions and doubts bubble

470
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.420
up to the surface and instead of
suspending your disbelief you openly

471
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.740
wonder if this is a strip club or a drag
bar is it camp

472
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:40.140
is it drama
is a cringe is it gritty is a glamor

473
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.280
even if Aster Hoss's script itself is
lacking it's one thing to say that

474
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.440
verhoven made a dog and pony show of
Badness a project he was signed on to

475
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.000
that had no hope of being good so he
steered the ship into hurricane Nomi in

476
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.119
the hopes that it would find a cult
audience so it's another thing entirely

477
00:36:57.119 --> 00:37:01.980
to argue that verhoven specifically
opted for the depictions that he did to

478
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.579
deliberately make a mockery of the
entire genre of rising star narratives

479
00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:10.920
through a lens so subtle that it was
mistaken for the trash

480
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.440
it was entirely meant to satirize
which provided verhoven's affinity for

481
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.380
satire I don't think it's out of the
realm of possibility

482
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.740
but Showgirls is an entirely different
Beast

483
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.839
so really the next question we need to
ask ourselves is

484
00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:40.740
what the [ __ ] is going on in this movie
[Music]

485
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.460
even if it's good for being bad you
don't make something this good without

486
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.180
knowing what you're doing as a filmmaker
you know it's a long path from

487
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.839
conception to release
to be good at your job you need to know

488
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:56.339
how to identify the Stepping Stones you
should avoid they're usually wobbly with

489
00:37:56.339 --> 00:38:01.200
bad writing acting or even editing you
want to stick to the solid stones to

490
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.280
make your job as easy as possible so
what happens if you choose to step on

491
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.260
all the wobbly ones on purpose before we
begin to look at Showgirls as a master

492
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.180
class in meta textual satire there are
cues to examine that indicate that even

493
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.220
if trying to make a mockery
verhoven can't help himself but use

494
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.449
exemplary cinematic technique
[Music]

495
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:34.190
[Music]

496
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.400
I don't want to miscommunicate even if
it is a case study of Badness it's

497
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.240
intended to be a collection of the worst
possible non-qualifiable narrative

498
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.099
decisions Showgirls from a structural
point of view is a big hot mess first

499
00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:50.760
you start with a plot that really isn't
anything special a normal girl gets

500
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.720
swept up into a life of Fame and stardom
by nothing but her own grit and raw

501
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.339
talent the quintessential American
Underdog though she learns that Life in

502
00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:04.200
the Fast Lane comes with its set of
drawbacks haunted by an examination of

503
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.859
who she has become to succeed in this
lifestyle she steps away from the

504
00:39:07.859 --> 00:39:12.720
spotlight she fought so hard to achieve
realizing that the real spotlight

505
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.099
where the people she met along the way
such and such Etc nonsense coupled with

506
00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:21.000
several love triangles a tempestuous
love-hate rivalry and an inevitable

507
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.859
departure from this lifestyle this movie
is basically every other movie like it

508
00:39:25.859 --> 00:39:29.339
but it's the fact that
stuffed into the plot

509
00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:33.960
is every other movie like it this movie
is the most

510
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.680
movie that it could possibly be within
the first seven minutes there is

511
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.460
hitchhiking a switchblade attempted
vehicular manslaughter references to

512
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.180
gambling addiction vomiting attempted
suicide and eluded lesbian undertones

513
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:49.980
and the movie doesn't really slow down
from there it systematically goes around

514
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:56.280
and hits every single Mark that a
dramatic film could hit this results in

515
00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.900
a plot that has about
two dozen things in it that don't really

516
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.380
need to be there it's a situation like
Tommy with sews the room where things

517
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.640
seem to just happen because these are
things that happen in dramatic movies so

518
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.640
it should go into this dramatic movie I
got the results of the test back I

519
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.720
definitely have breast cancer so it's
really hard to synopsisize Showgirls for

520
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.400
its elements of Badness because there
are many sequences that seem to be from

521
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.200
many different sub-genres of rising star
movies on one hand it wants to draw from

522
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.740
the starving artist who's persevering on
Talent alone on the other hand it's

523
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.220
telling a story about the exploitation
of women in entertainment it's also

524
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.160
telling a story about navigating the
politics of the entertainment industry

525
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.820
and it's telling a story about the
consequences of stardom burlesque Black

526
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.960
Swan Hustlers any number of the
stars-born movies they're only trying to

527
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:51.180
tell one of those stories there are also
sequences that just don't make any sense

528
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:56.460
the recurring theme of food is strange
even though she's managed to be an

529
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.359
incredibly successful crowd pleaser at
the Cheetah club Nomi is now relegated

530
00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:03.920
to a diet of brown rice and vegetables
this

531
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.420
apparently culminates later on in the
film with Nomi reflecting on her life

532
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.220
while gazing over the Vegas strip eating
a hamburger it seems that under the

533
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.599
pressure she has broken from her diet to
afford herself a small pleasure which

534
00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:22.079
would be very impactful if it wasn't for
the fact that

535
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.880
not only do we never see her ingest
brown rice and or vegetables but we do

536
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.540
see her eating junk food regularly
including a hamburger outside of looking

537
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.720
pretty this scene offers nothing to the
development of the character there's

538
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.040
also the weirdness in which esterhaus
has these people talking about brown

539
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.300
rice and vegetables like it's nutrient
paste do you like brown rice and

540
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:50.160
vegetables yeah
you do worse than dog food and food in

541
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.079
general I've had dog food

542
00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.839
you have doggy Chow John I used to love
doggie Chow

543
00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:04.560
I love doggy Joe
avoid this sign up for hellofresh and

544
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.500
especially given that the entire
top-down decision making behind the

545
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.820
movie was about tits I'm especially
confused about the depiction of nipples

546
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.560
the missiles first of all
is it normal for girls to apply lipstick

547
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.060
to their nipples is that a thing do
straight guys want that what what what's

548
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.680
going on here but primarily the display
of bear boobies is so gratuitous it

549
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.160
Ventures into complete desensitization
again this is a movie about topless

550
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.180
girls in a Las Vegas show boobs being
nothing special is probably par for the

551
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:37.260
course however this ends up being
another indication that Esther Haas

552
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:41.820
doesn't know what he's talking about
topless shows in Las Vegas to my

553
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.140
knowledge according to one Elvira do not
happen like this yes there were topless

554
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:51.000
shows in Vegas but nipples were covered
with pasties or tassels so that's a

555
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.280
thing and second the girls were rarely
exploited to this degree at least not

556
00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.099
professionally okay show me your tits

557
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.579
this scene itself
is a bit wonky

558
00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:09.240
because there's a huge deal made about
Nomi exposing herself like this even

559
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.800
though it's nothing we've already seen
at least once in the last 30 minutes the

560
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.240
more impactful thing to do would be to
have know me never really take off her

561
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.920
top in the early part of the movie even
at the strip club however because she

562
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.960
wants this part so badly she's willing
to begin making compromises but because

563
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.420
not one scene earlier we saw Nomi give
it topless gyroscopic lap dance when the

564
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.440
audition scene hits not only are Nomi's
boobs nothing we haven't seen before but

565
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.880
her reaction doesn't fit someone who has
been stripping to pay rent

566
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.420
since she stepped foot in Vegas
according to interviews with Vegas

567
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.640
showgirls the topless part of auditions
was done very impersonally the dancer

568
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.000
would have a topless Polaroid taken
which would be shown to the director

569
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.839
later the photo would likely be taken by
another woman I can't speak to the

570
00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:02.880
casting procedures of every director in
Vegas but esterhaus seems to treat it

571
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.200
like the worst person is the common
element this movie is about the

572
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.400
exploitation of women in professional
spaces and we will twist the plot's arm

573
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.060
to make it happen God damn it you can
tell that Esther Haas was at the very

574
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.079
least thinking of the themes he was
trying to present here because even

575
00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:24.900
after her tantrum Nomi gets the part and
on her first performance she opts to

576
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.240
apply ice to her nipples herself
signifying that she's being corrupted by

577
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.500
the drive to compete in this atmosphere
not that someone passed the third row

578
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.760
would be able to see how hard her
nipples are but you know symbolism the

579
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.980
sexual themes themselves are
a lot and common celebrations of

580
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.040
Showgirls Focus around several famous
sex scenes where Elizabeth Berkeley

581
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.160
demonstrates her core strength the sex
is quick wild and demonstrates a

582
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.460
Fantastical ease at which women can
reach convulsing orgasm while riding a

583
00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.660
man's abdomen for those who have seen
Basic Instinct one may say that this is

584
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.900
just how Paul verhoven thinks sex
happens however the sex and Basic

585
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.500
Instincts served a methodical purpose
sex in the opening scene features a

586
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:12.300
woman rhythmically arriving a soon to be
ice-picked man every subsequent instance

587
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.220
of sex in the movie going forward
becomes a little bit more unhinged in

588
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.980
the final sequence Catherine tremel is
rigid robotic and not at all sexy my

589
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.819
take on this is that it's meant to be
read that she loses a bit of her

590
00:45:26.819 --> 00:45:32.819
Humanity as we get to the core of who
she really is the sex and showgirls

591
00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:38.520
at least doesn't seem to be as nuanced
it's kind of just wacky definitely worth

592
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.780
a watch content warning of course
because there is an completely out of

593
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.200
nowhere sexual assault which I would say
even provided an artistic reading of

594
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.920
show Girls shouldn't be there actress
Gina Rivera did not need to be put

595
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.780
through that but if the movie is this
much of a train wreck

596
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.090
why would I ever assume that there was
anything more to it

597
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:06.970
[Music]
foreign

598
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:11.290
[Music]

599
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.359
the first real indication I noticed of
Showgirls demonstrating that it knows

600
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:20.040
what it's doing came towards the end of
the second act rising star Naomi Malone

601
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:25.200
has just sabotaged the show's star
Crystal Connors and taken her role as

602
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.579
the star of this world-renowned show
goddess while being celebrated by the

603
00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:33.720
Press Nomi poses beside the power
players of the casino

604
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.280
chest bear
this is an almost identical Recreation

605
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:43.560
of an earlier scene with Crystal Connors
the primary difference aside from know

606
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.480
me being in her Shadow is that Crystal
conceals herself in a massive fur coach

607
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.760
the connections between the two scenes
function on multiple levels having moved

608
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.440
up from her Vegas Origins as a dancer in
a strip club Nomi longs to be part of

609
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.119
The Prestige of proper performance
dancing Crystal spends the entire movie

610
00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:06.240
trying to convince her that at their
core

611
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.099
there really isn't any difference
between topless dancing at this casino

612
00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:15.180
and topless dancing at the Cheetah club
Nomi resents Crystal for these little

613
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.200
reminders and fully chooses to believe
that she has left behind her old

614
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.640
salacious life for greener pastures
Crystal cynically entertains no

615
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.020
Illusions know me by contrast is open
and exposed to the glittering fantasy of

616
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.980
Las Vegas she is so enchanted by the
lights and the glamor that she is

617
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.940
vulnerable to the darker reality of the
industry even as Crystal does what she

618
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:41.460
can to disenchant Nomi to the underbelly
of it so now that we have this one very

619
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.380
visceral instance of symbolism
what do we do with it we can either

620
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.660
discount it as an accident or a
coincidence or we can examine valhoven's

621
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.940
film library and give him the benefit of
the doubt if this one instance holds

622
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.960
heavy symbology
what else in the movie is symbolic if we

623
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.640
examine Crystal as a proper literary
foil to know me rather than just a Trope

624
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.960
there's a bit of a rabbit hole that we
can go down Crystal urges Nomi to

625
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.500
understand that there are more
similarities between them than

626
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.780
differences Crystal still Likens herself
to a kind of sex worker but Nomi does

627
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.740
not find this similarity flattering what
seems to be the story's apparent villain

628
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.040
trying to get a rise out of the
protagonist is actually an indication

629
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.880
that Crystal sees right through her the
only difference between them it seems is

630
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.980
that Crystal is honest about her former
identity whereas Nomi keeps paulianne

631
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.660
Costello hidden from everyone when Nomi
does get a role in the chorus she seems

632
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.980
to feel like she's moved up in the world
and no longer has to exploit herself for

633
00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:49.020
survival this is of course not the case
I mean really the script doesn't handle

634
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.640
this with a whole lot of subtlety

635
00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:00.480
hard sells subtext the girls it seems
are regularly brought in to entertain

636
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.520
potential businessmen to facilitate
Partnerships with the casino meanwhile

637
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.200
at the cheetah there are very clear very
specific rules about interactions with

638
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.720
John's 50 books a pop you take them in
the back touch and go they touch they go

639
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.460
you can touch them they cannot touch you
there are no such rules at the Stardust

640
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.119
the girls are exploited and pitted
against each other they are shopped

641
00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:27.839
around for sex and they use sex to
advance their positions there's even an

642
00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:32.099
argument to be made that claims that the
cheetah is a safer more wholesome

643
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:38.099
atmosphere than the Stardust which may
not be an approximation to reality but

644
00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:42.900
it fuels the point the film is trying to
make it also helps that as Nomi enters

645
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.599
the chorus of goddess there are numerous
ways that the dancers are subtextually

646
00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:51.660
dehumanized through a number of
comparisons to animals primarily there's

647
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:56.760
I still love doggie Chow coupled with
the addition of a set of chimpanzees

648
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.420
the administration considers managing
the girls to be the same as managing The

649
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:05.220
Chimps what they say or want doesn't
really matter so long as they dance

650
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.960
even the show within the show goddess
mirrors the film itself while we never

651
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:15.480
see the show start to finish nor do we
even see all of its numbers the audience

652
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.640
has evidence of four maybe five sets we
know the introduction is the volcano

653
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.960
setting iconic and we know that the
finale ends with Crystal being lifted

654
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.380
from the stage
we see the industrial setting where Nomi

655
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.160
pushes Crystal down a flight of stairs
and based on costume changes backstage

656
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:36.060
we know that after the opening number we
go into a beat address sequence that

657
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.720
thanks to a boat show we can link to one
of the most played songs in the movie

658
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.339
between the beaded dress and the
industrial set there may be another

659
00:50:44.339 --> 00:50:49.680
fifth number for which we hear the music
in the audition choreography but not for

660
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.420
sure the assumed plot of goddess in
sequence opens with men and women in

661
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.859
chaos and conflict the goddess's arrival
ushers in an era of passion and

662
00:50:58.859 --> 00:51:04.559
sensuality as the archetype of sexuality
and Womanhood in stark contrast to Our

663
00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:08.339
abrahamic Roots we can't say what the
next two numbers are about but when we

664
00:51:08.339 --> 00:51:11.880
next pick up with the industrial scene
women and The Feminine archetype of the

665
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:16.619
Goddess are held prisoner and exploited
by the men on stage in turn the women

666
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:20.700
are in conflict with each other we move
into the presumably final sequence of

667
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.140
the show where there is once again unity
in order and the goddess transcends the

668
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:29.220
world in the same way that Nomi Malone
transcends Las Vegas when she decides

669
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:33.599
that the casino industry is a bit too
skeezy for her granted the play within a

670
00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:38.040
play a literary device is crude but
serviceable it indicates that those

671
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.160
creating this film are thinking about
their own content

672
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:49.099
[Music]

673
00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:56.220
be fair some of this may be to Esther
haas's credit it seems he had clear

674
00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:01.440
intent but just got kind of very mixed
up in all of the pesky minutia of the

675
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.700
you know being a human being thing I've
heard rumors that he had a clause in his

676
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.720
contract that no changes to the script
could be made after his final draft

677
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.059
which is never the case in Hollywood the
director almost always rewrites a script

678
00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:19.200
or has it Rewritten to match their own
style however estherhas and verhoven

679
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.400
were friends so there may have been a
significant amount of input that

680
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.380
verhoven had in its development without
asking verhoven I can't really know for

681
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:33.420
certain but provided that there is some
very deliberate methodology incorporated

682
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:37.980
into the visuals of this film
what happens if we give it the benefit

683
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.619
of the doubt and say that this was all
deliberate at the same time if we take

684
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:46.800
into consideration what expectations
were coming down from Studio heads at

685
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.359
MGM what do we get we get a movie that
does exactly what the studio wanted it

686
00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:55.140
to
everything not because the filmmakers

687
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.740
didn't know how to restrain themselves
but because they were deliberately

688
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.220
trying to conform to the level of
ridiculousness that this film was

689
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.480
expected to be it's like that episode
from The Simpsons when Homer designs his

690
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.280
own car each little part is kind of a
cool idea on its own but assemble

691
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.000
everything together and if you just get
a monstrosity because the point of

692
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.500
Showgirls isn't about the corruptive
power of Fame it's not about the sexual

693
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.220
exploitation of women in the
entertainment industry the point of show

694
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:28.740
Girls
is to point out that this movie is a

695
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.400
monstrosity because all of these things
in Showgirls are things that in other

696
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.660
movies are celebrated just like know me
the audience is suspended into believing

697
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.780
that these kinds of Underdog Fame
narratives are possible

698
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.680
how many girls in America set out to Las
Vegas hoping to be seen by the right

699
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.319
person
how many of them never get out of the

700
00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:50.579
cheetah Showgirls is holding a mirror up
in front of that expectation it's as

701
00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:54.960
ridiculous as these sex scenes just like
women having orgasms in behoven films

702
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.280
the cell is the dream the Khan is
believing that it could really happen

703
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.960
that way Showgirls is like its content
it only really works if we live in a

704
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.920
fantasy world where rules don't matter
the dancing the glamor even Nomi's

705
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.119
insane wild sex moves they all benefit a
fantasy

706
00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:16.800
of what it could be like people praising
Nomi for her incredible dancing skills a

707
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.260
fantasy a stripper reaching climax while
giving a lap dance a fantasy the sexual

708
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.400
fantasies seemed to fit a masculine
perspective the fame and fortune

709
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.819
fantasies seem to speak to the dreams
and Ambitions of young women

710
00:54:29.819 --> 00:54:34.440
the whole thing suggests that Vegas or
the idea of Vegas is

711
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:40.079
a fantasy all while the film makes a
scathing criticism of Las Vegas itself

712
00:54:40.079 --> 00:54:43.500
for all that Nomi holds up Vegas
entertainment has the Pinnacle of

713
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:48.599
prestige and dance valhoven takes every
opportunity to Lampoon Las Vegas itself

714
00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:53.280
from the comedic acts of the drag-esque
performances at the cheetah to Nomi's

715
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.660
Premier performance as goddess being
heralded by a singing man in a toga at

716
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.380
the famous Caesar's Palace even
something as nonsensical as Nomi's

717
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:08.160
mispronunciation of Versace as Versace
while this textually shows the audience

718
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:13.740
that even if Nomi dresses herself up
that she doesn't actually have any class

719
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.059
if we take into consideration that this
is a movie made by Europeans it says

720
00:55:18.059 --> 00:55:21.540
something else all these high-rolling
Americans making fun of Nomi for

721
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.339
pronouncing Versace wrong seem to be
clueless that this Italian surname is

722
00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:31.740
pronounced Versace they are mocking her
for saying it wrong and correcting her

723
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.540
with a different mispronunciation for
all the Vegas props itself up as a high

724
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.960
society
just like Nomi slipping on a dress she

725
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.819
bought with a 500 lap dance
Vegas doesn't have a lick of class

726
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:49.619
itself
there's a tacky greasy cringy film over

727
00:55:49.619 --> 00:55:54.800
everything in this town in the movie
fake pyramids fake breasts fake values

728
00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:00.540
this world that know me prizes so
desperately is the equivalent of a

729
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.839
cardboard cutout of success and
validation

730
00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:10.020
even the down to earth artist dancer who
promotes real values is fake

731
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.940
the only thing that's real is fakeness
something that Crystal is nonchalantly

732
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:19.500
trying to communicate
the film lies to your face when its

733
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.260
characters remark that know me is a good
dancer

734
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:26.220
the film lies to you when it tells you
that female orgasms can happen

735
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:31.559
instantaneously and the film seems to be
pointing out that any other time you see

736
00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:37.040
this stuff in any other movie it's just
as much of a lie

737
00:56:39.859 --> 00:56:42.980
thank you

738
00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.660
[Music]

739
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:59.119
foreign
[Music]

740
00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:05.819
for Showgirls is accomplishing exactly
what I would argue the filmmakers want

741
00:57:05.819 --> 00:57:09.900
to communicate maybe there was once an
intention to make this an earnestly good

742
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.880
movie and the pieces are all there maybe
dial back the clown car of a script to

743
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.800
focus on the beats that support the
underlying themes without obfuscating

744
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.780
them my deepest reading of Showgirls is
that it functions as a warning verhoven

745
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:31.020
longed to validate the NC-17 rating
because of the way the American NC-17

746
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.940
rating was widely applied to European
films that were otherwise celebrated and

747
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.720
popular
the open displays of sexual themes in

748
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.880
cinema was and remains fairly common in
Europe verhoven expressed frustration

749
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.839
that when these films went for an
American release

750
00:57:48.839 --> 00:57:52.920
they would be stamped with an NC-17
rating and they would tank at the box

751
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:58.619
office an NC-17 is
like taking a hit out on a movie in

752
00:57:58.619 --> 00:58:02.460
America this is speculation on my part
but when verhoven finally had a studio

753
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.440
stamp of approval to make an NC-17
Hollywood feature his tune may have

754
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.520
changed perhaps validating the NC-17
rating

755
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:17.160
would have just resulted in studio heads
throwing tits in a movie and not for any

756
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.000
artistic reason just for shock factor
and instead of deliberately sabotaging

757
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.140
the project verhoven crafted the kind of
film that would eventually be the

758
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.940
outcome of letting Hollywood Executives
notoriously know very little about

759
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:33.960
Cinema or film Theory play with tits
perhaps you realize that America

760
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:39.200
wouldn't adopt more European values
instead would be more like

761
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:45.720
Las Vegas Nomi's Exodus from Nevada on
the road to Los Angeles was heralding a

762
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.619
warning to Hollywood
that upon the conditional validation of

763
00:58:49.619 --> 00:58:54.359
NC-17 sexuality one could expect many
movies to become more like Showgirls

764
00:58:54.359 --> 00:59:00.540
instead of say angli's lust caution
and that perhaps Americans simply do not

765
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:05.040
have the same values when it comes to
sex or sexuality as Europeans when as a

766
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.559
society did we become so confused about
the difference between sex acts and

767
00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:14.579
sexuality
to the point where even an object which

768
00:59:14.579 --> 00:59:18.540
is tangentially related to a symbol of
sexuality is seen more or less as the

769
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.099
same as promiscuity itself
during the 2016 presidential run husband

770
00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:27.359
of presidential candidate Pete butterjas
chaston canceled a scheduled campaign

771
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:32.819
stop in a gay bar because there was a
poll on the stage a poll which well used

772
00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:36.900
for many things one of which being the
traditional dance form in India and

773
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:41.220
China can be used for sexual titillation
many in the queer community at large saw

774
00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:45.780
this as a slap in the face from a man
whose claim to fame was the first openly

775
00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:50.400
gay man to run for president
and an ill Omen of how he would observe

776
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.960
queer issues from the Oval Office but
the question to me wasn't why Buddha

777
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.400
judge specifically would reject an
instance of queer sexuality

778
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.480
but why is it expected of American
political representatives to detest

779
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.380
sexuality
in general

780
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:12.660
the more we reject instances of sex and
sexuality the more we treat sex as this

781
01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:17.220
naughty taboo thing where the slightest
mention of human sexuality something

782
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.220
that is pivotally fundamental to the
species is risque but we can't ever not

783
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:29.579
think about sex as a society because
looming over this sexist dirty mindset

784
01:00:29.579 --> 01:00:36.720
is the fact that we are all aware that
every person in this Society exists as a

785
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.760
result of sex
the movie The Showgirls was meant to be

786
01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.780
can never exist in Hollywood
because the second you want to develop

787
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:50.160
an artistic project about sex sex is all
it's ever going to be about

788
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.559
sex becomes a gimmick sex becomes a
spectacle a selling point sex becomes a

789
01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:59.579
statement
a shock an exploitation

790
01:00:59.579 --> 01:01:05.400
but one thing that sex can never be seen
as is normal I can see a very

791
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.420
problematic state of human existence
arising from a mindset where the action

792
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.579
dependent on our survival is seen as
abnormal because if sex itself is

793
01:01:14.579 --> 01:01:20.160
abnormal sexuality and any opinion you
may have about sex is abnormal too even

794
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.780
an unwillingness to have sex is seen as
abnormal because people believe that in

795
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.160
spite of society's condemnation of it
that you still should want to do it

796
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.980
anyway and it's weird if you don't it's
a very sad state of America when a film

797
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:39.780
about the exploitation of sex is decried
as one of the worst movies of all time

798
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:44.400
whereas when the same director made
RoboCop featuring gratuitous violence

799
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.099
and the plot of which is just about as
nonsensical it is held up as an action

800
01:01:50.099 --> 01:01:55.799
masterpiece
violence is okay sex is not we need to

801
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:59.819
begin reevaluating our widespread
stigmatization of sex because even as

802
01:01:59.819 --> 01:02:03.660
the NC-17 rating remains a death knell
for Hollywood movies some of the most

803
01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.140
significant television series that have
been made between now and the release of

804
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:11.400
Showgirls would have gotten that rating
without hesitation Game of Thrones sex

805
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.020
in the city Queer as Folk we clearly are
comfortable enough with sex to be open

806
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.500
to its depiction in the comfort of our
own homes

807
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.839
but we still like to pretend like it
doesn't exist when we're anywhere else

808
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:30.359
a world where Showgirls exists is a
world where America can find dignity and

809
01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:33.599
sex
a culture that is embarrassed by sex

810
01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:38.280
cannot take it seriously
because nobody is going to know how to

811
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.240
bring it up in polite Society think
about that the next time you shame

812
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.819
someone for posting a thirst trap on
Instagram

813
01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:48.480
or get embarrassed because your friends
started in only fans we're never going

814
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:55.559
to be able to use art to celebrate sex
if we use sex to shame other people so

815
01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:58.740
if you find yourself in the habit of
shaming others for their sexual

816
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:04.740
practices or even micromanaging what
ought to qualify as normal sex

817
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.420
take a moment to stop and remind
yourself

818
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:14.660
that it's you
it's your fault

819
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.859
it's your fault that we have showgirls

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.460
