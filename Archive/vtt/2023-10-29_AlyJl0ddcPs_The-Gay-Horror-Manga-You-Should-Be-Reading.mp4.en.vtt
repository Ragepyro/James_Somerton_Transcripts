8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.079
On a scorching day in rural Japan, we find
ourselves in the midst of a chilling tale,

9
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.230
where two boys, Yoshiki and Hikaru, seek solace
from the relentless heat by indulging in frozen

10
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.579
treats from a quaint local store.

11
00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.269
Outdoors, amidst their laughter, a sudden
unease grips Yoshiki, prompting him to utter

12
00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.640
these haunting words to his friend: "You ain't
the real Hikaru, are you?"

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.299
Hikaru, initially taken aback, undergoes a
startling transformation as his human facade

14
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.830
fades away, revealing the demonic spiritual
entity lurking within.

15
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.729
However, instead of unleashing his malevolence
upon Yoshiki, Hikaru surprises us all by embracing

16
00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.540
his friend, pleading with him not to reveal
his true nature.

17
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.869
You see, this is the first time this new Hikaru
has experienced life as a human, even if he's

18
00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.250
borrowing the old Hikaru's form – his feelings
for Yoshiki are undeniably genuine.

19
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.509
The real Hikaru may be lost, but Yoshiki,
consumed by grief and fear, accepts this new

20
00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.149
Hikaru into his life, for he cannot bear to
be without his friend.

21
00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:04.350
Thus begins the spine-tingling horror manga
"The Summer Hikaru Died" by the mangaka MokuMokuren.

22
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.300
It debuted in August of 2021, and has enjoyed
resounding commercial success, despite the

23
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.900
unease it provokes among commentators within
the medium who have a hard time categorising

24
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.129
it.

25
00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.510
Is it a BL manga?

26
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.120
Is it horror?

27
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.960
Can it possibly be both?

28
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.090
The difficulty in classifying the genre of
this story itself puts us at an interesting

29
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.430
juncture.

30
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.069
With ‘gay boys’ being a genre all to their
own, perhaps this has set a precedent for

31
00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.239
gay characters being unable to appear in other
genres.

32
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.819
Does the inclusion of a gay character automatically
facilitate a gay story?

33
00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.480
It seems that among publishers and critics,
this may very well be the case.

34
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.550
Meaning that when a horror story about one
or possibly more gay characters becomes a

35
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.220
sensation, there’s a reluctance to discuss
it because it’s unclear whether it ought

36
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.530
to be judged on its merits as horror… or
as BL.

37
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.780
This speaks to a common complaint among nonbinary
people and some trans people as well.

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.360
Why does the inability to sort this thing
into one of two categories generate so much

39
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.800
confusion?

40
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.530
Is it gay or straight?

41
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.409
Are they a man or woman?

42
00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.290
In either case, many people won’t neatly
fit into either of those groups, and it’s

43
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.819
just as incorrect to force people into these
categories as it is to omit people altogether

44
00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.600
because they can’t pass.

45
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.170
Similarly, it’s also wrong to look at The
Summer Hikaru Died in the same way.

46
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.239
Genre classification limits the scope of what
a story can be, and is often biassed to what

47
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.569
the hegemonistic majority considers ‘normal.’

48
00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.330
I wouldn’t take it as a good sign either
if it were classified as a ‘cross-genre’

49
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.590
for the same reason that we don’t consider
‘straight-horror’ to be a genre.

50
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.290
‘Boys kissing’ and ‘scary’ do not
need to be two different genres.

51
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.700
Because when you’re a gay boy living in
a rural village, kissing another boy is VERY

52
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.709
scary.

53
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.090
And it also seems that The Summer Hikaru died
explores many of these same horrors.

54
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.410
Even though whatever has replaced his friend
speaks with that voice and projects those

55
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.120
emotions, Yoshiki is left in mourning regardless.

56
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.590
Caught between ‘everything is different’
and ‘nothing has changed.’

57
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.979
Yoshiki grapples with the fact that Hikaru
still acts ‘normal’ while he feels that

58
00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.580
he has lost something that he will never get
back.

59
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.729
This new Hikaru… though he smiles, laughs,
and cries just like his predecessor, is not

60
00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.320
the same.

61
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.170
The-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru has adopted
all of Hikaru’s memories and feelings.

62
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.780
Pragmatically — this Hikaru ought to be
no different than the previous one.

63
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.139
Yoshiki is unsure if he can go on with his
life without a clear answer, though.

64
00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.870
No matter how much Yoshiki wishes this thing
were still Hikaru, some things are just...

65
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.290
off, especially at first.

66
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.819
He exhibits an unnatural enthusiasm for mundane
experiences, and even kind-hearted animals

67
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.890
cower in his presence.

68
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.530
But The-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru is just
so thankful for his friend’s acceptance

69
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.220
— for Yoshiki to show kindness to ‘someone
like him.’

70
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.600
However, Yoshiki grapples internally.

71
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.760
He questions his own sanity for embracing
this being, this entity that once was his

72
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.900
friend.

73
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.870
His disquiet only intensifies when some townsfolk
react to Hikaru as if he were the very monster

74
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.949
that had taken residence within him.

75
00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:03.280
It’s important to note that this new Hikaru
never harmed the real one.

76
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.040
While some may be hesitant to trust a monster,
this is confirmed in a flashback.

77
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.539
The original Hikaru, dying alone in the forest,
had pleaded for someone to protect Yoshiki,

78
00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.289
and that's when this enigmatic spirit inhabited
his body.

79
00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.759
Now it carries the warmth and love Hikaru
felt for Yoshiki, vowing to safeguard him

80
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.810
by any means necessary.

81
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.060
The-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru lacks the social
awareness of being a born-and-raised human,

82
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.340
and declares the feelings that the previous
Hikaru had kept hidden from Yoshiki: that

83
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.080
“he’s crazy for him”

84
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.449
Which ought to betray any doubt that Hikaru
is gay or gay-questioning.

85
00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.479
While it is not a specific classification
on his part, the phrasing and context of this

86
00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.389
line says all that it needs to.

87
00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.569
Subtly shouldn’t need to be specific to
be apparent.

88
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.280
What isn’t subtle is that there is something
much darker and more ominous lurking in this

89
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.000
quaint little town than our sweet Hikaru.

90
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.690
The forest covered mountain itself is alive,
teeming with spirits, some far less benign

91
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.440
than the one residing within this boy.

92
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.791
When a group of their school friends takes
a shortcut through the forest one day, they

93
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:30.090
feel uneasy, especially Yoshiki.

94
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:36.320
There's an ominous presence watching them,
drawing nearer.

95
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:44.090
It lunges at Yoshiki, attempting to possess
him, but Hikaru steps in, absorbing the spirit,

96
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.530
battling it to shield his friend.

97
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.229
The fight even makes his nose bleed.

98
00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:56.660
Hikaru warns Yoshiki about spirits… that
they're lonely and latch onto anyone who gazes

99
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.590
upon them.

100
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:04.849
He advises Yoshiki to avoid looking at any
spirits, except for him.

101
00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:11.120
Yet, Hikaru is not as adept at concealing
his secrets as he believes.

102
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.909
One of their friends, a girl named Asako,
senses something amiss.

103
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:22.210
She can't quite put her finger on it, but
she knows that Hikaru's nosebleed was no random

104
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.419
occurrence.

105
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:31.270
Curiosity gnawing at him, Yoshiki longs to
understand how Hikaru took the spirit inside

106
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.510
him.

107
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:38.160
Unable to convey it verbally, Hikaru decides
to demonstrate it physically.

108
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.440
When they are alone, he exposes a dark slit
in his chest, inviting Yoshiki to plunge his

109
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.160
hand inside.

110
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:53.280
The spirit beyond the form of Hikaru is tumultuous,
chaotic, and cold.

111
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.920
A sensation Yoshiki compares towards raw chicken
in marinade.

112
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.480
Hikaru finds great pleasure in the feeling
of a warm body — a sensation he cannot even

113
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.850
recall having as a spirit.

114
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:13.710
Unexpectedly, he draws the arm deeper inside
of him, sending Yoshiki into a panic.

115
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:21.180
Reeling away, Hikaru laughs and tries to assure
Yoshiki that he was never in any harm.

116
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.380
Just horsing around.

117
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.750
This is a pivotal scene for framing the whole
of the series, and cementing this story as

118
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.529
not only containing gay characters, but presenting
gay experiences.

119
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:39.350
Without being explicit, this scene portrays
a representation of sexual experimentation.

120
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:46.649
While Hikaru’s enjoyment is apparent, Yoshiki
is confused as to whether he likes the sensation

121
00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:47.860
or not.

122
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:55.529
Hikaru, while abiding by consent, does push
boundaries — a bit too fast for Yoshiki.

123
00:09:55.529 --> 00:10:00.180
Moving at different speeds is also a hallmark
of developing queer identity.

124
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.500
To Yoshiki, there is an element of danger
with this.

125
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.260
And this danger articulates an ongoing theme
in the series about the-thing-that replaced-Hikaru:

126
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.080
should we be afraid of it or not?

127
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.529
Because an act of Hikaru ‘just playing around’
is a horror to Yoshiki.

128
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:25.720
Regardless that Hikaru himself is aware of
the difference between ‘play’ and ‘harm,’

129
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.500
Yoshiki does not know the limitations and
abilities of this spirit.

130
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.510
Being harmless and meaning no harm are two
different things.

131
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.800
A question that persistently looms over the
head of the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru.

132
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.149
These anxieties compound within Yoshiki.

133
00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:47.339
In addition to his questions of whether he
can think of the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru

134
00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:53.860
as Hikaru, he now has questions about his
own feelings for himself.

135
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.180
In the fever of this internal struggle, he
has a chance encounter with a woman from town.

136
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.860
She does not recognize him… but she recognizes
something about him.

137
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.610
She reveals that she used to sense an ominous
presence emanating from the mountainous forest…

138
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.220
the very mountains where Hikaru met his end.

139
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.430
However, she remarks that the malevolence
that once resided far away has now crossed

140
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.990
into the village.

141
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.850
And she spies that this malevolence has touched
Yoshiki.

142
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:32.130
Expressing concern for him, she explains that
as humans draw closer to spirits and the realm

143
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.220
of spirits, they become ‘mixed.’

144
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.730
She warns that Yoshiki is doomed if he continues
his entanglement with the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru.

145
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:48.610
The first of a series of warnings against
‘mixing’ with others who should remain

146
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.880
separate.

147
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.450
This revelation deepens Yoshiki's disquiet
around Hikaru, though guilt gnaws at him whenever

148
00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:03.450
they are together, for Hikaru is unfailingly
kind, professing that just being near Yoshiki

149
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.450
brings him joy.

150
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.649
But that’s not a mutual feeling for Yoshiki.

151
00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:15.180
The way Hikaru looks, sounds, talks, it’s
all Hikaru… but he’s not Hikaru.

152
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.490
But the spirit can’t let Yoshiki go because
he feels everything Hikaru felt.

153
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.750
He liked him too much.

154
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:29.560
His feelings for Yoshiki were so strong that
even after death they remain, and they bind

155
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.089
the spirit to him.

156
00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:36.839
Terrified, Yoshiki demands that Hikaru leave
him be, claiming he no longer needs him.

157
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:41.560
This sends Hikaru spiralling into despair,
questioning why he isn't enough.

158
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.660
What’s really so different about him?

159
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.510
He’s the same person, more or less, only
one thing has changed, and it’s not even

160
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.010
something most people can see.

161
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.850
He just doesn’t want Yoshiki to hate him.

162
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.060
The next day Yoshiki apologises.

163
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:03.930
In tears, Hikaru tells Yoshiki he just wants
to be near him, that’s all.

164
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.370
That’s all that he needs.

165
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.800
To please just not hate him.

166
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.991
Instead of forsaking his friend, Yoshiki opts
to stand by Hikaru's side, heedless of the

167
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:16.480
ominous warnings he has received.

168
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.080
The once-fearful animals gradually warm up
to Hikaru, and he joins Yoshiki and his younger

169
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.510
sister at a summer festival, just like any
ordinary kid.

170
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:31.760
But has to turn back when he comes up against
a Torii gate, blocking this spirit from entering

171
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.690
the Shinto shrine.

172
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:39.520
So Yoshiki gets some shaved ice for both of
them and they eat it outside the gate.

173
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.490
There, Yoshiki reveals something to Hikaru
that his friend didn’t know.

174
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.720
That he’d actually seen Hikaru’s dead
body.

175
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.820
The stormy night he went missing, Yoshiki
trudged out into the rain, marching through

176
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.320
the forest until he found his friend’s body,
unresponsive.

177
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.699
The trauma left him bedridden for days and
when he finally came around…

178
00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:05.910
Hikaru was alive.

179
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.089
This new Hikaru was alive.

180
00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:13.790
He grieved the loss of his closest friend
for days before finding out that he was still

181
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.639
here, in some way.

182
00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.959
He thought it was a dream.

183
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:24.990
But even now, sitting next to Hikaru as he
is… he misses his old friend.

184
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:33.240
In response, Hikaru pledges to Yoshiki that,
although he may never truly replace the original,

185
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.680
he will always cherish and protect him.

186
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.610
However, at this point in the manga, we take
a departure from the tale to uncover a council

187
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:49.120
of individuals well-versed in the spiritual
happenings of the area.

188
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.800
Something known as "Kubitachi's Burden" has
escaped the confines of the forest and infiltrated

189
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.649
the town.

190
00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:02.220
As a result, they've enlisted the services
of an expert to investigate this phenomenon

191
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.329
firsthand.

192
00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:07.650
This spells danger for Hikaru, and also Yoshiki.

193
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.959
The pair begin growing close again.

194
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:14.279
Yoshiki even puts his hand in Hikaru’s body
once more, this time permitting himself to

195
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:21.089
wonder if it does feel good, in spite of telling
himself it ought to feel wrong.

196
00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:24.899
But getting this close to Hikaru might be
dangerous, according to some.

197
00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:29.910
It might attract other things from the spiritual
side toward Yoshiki.

198
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.279
Things more dangerous and unpredictable than
his smiling friend.

199
00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:39.009
Like some sort of demon lurking in Yoshiki’s
shower drain that attacks his little sister.

200
00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:45.330
A demon Hikaru promises to deal with… but
when Hikaru seems to be taking too long Yoshiki

201
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.089
becomes worried, and comes to rescue him.

202
00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:55.040
The demon takes the opportunity to lunge into
Yoshiki, take over his mind and forces him

203
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.139
to try and drown Hikaru.

204
00:15:56.139 --> 00:16:03.350
The demon is expelled and escapes, giving
Yoshiki a glimpse into the danger that spirits

205
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.610
present.

206
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.889
As time marches on, the council of village
elders redoubles their efforts to unearth

207
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:14.200
the truth behind the elusive forest spirit's
escape.

208
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.380
One fateful night, amidst a gathering of friends,
Hikaru and Yoshiki find themselves separated,

209
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.009
leaving Hikaru alone with Asako.

210
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:30.970
The young girl delves into memories of Hikaru
from before his mysterious disappearance and

211
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.339
then poses a daunting question to the new
Hikaru:

212
00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:38.540
"Who exactly are you?"

213
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.150
Asako has a familial history of sensing spirits.

214
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.190
Some may see them as faint shadows, but Asako
can hear them.

215
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.380
Even though she can sense that there is something
paranormal about Hikaru, she does not fear

216
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.380
him.

217
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.850
She recalls an experience where she encountered
an invisible spirit calling for her attention

218
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.630
on a village road.

219
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:03.370
Trying to live by her family’s rules of
remaining separate from spirits, she eventually

220
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.320
realised that this spirit was trying to warn
her — her best friend was crossing a blind

221
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.949
corner where a driver was speeding.

222
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:13.990
The spirit saved her friend’s life.

223
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.900
While other characters who are aware of spirits
believe that not all spirits are malevolent,

224
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:25.559
they hold the caveat that — because some
are dangerous, that we must be suspicious

225
00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:26.559
of all.

226
00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.120
Asako simply does not have this outlook.

227
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.700
Instead, showing a willingness to allow the
spirit to show its true colours.

228
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.049
Just as she affords that same opportunity
to the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru.

229
00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:45.510
Noticing for the first time that she can see
him differently than others, the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru

230
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:51.460
tries to show her his true form, that which
he can only describe to Yoshiki.

231
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.880
Perhaps she can see him for what he truly
is, stripped of the physical form.

232
00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.309
He does, after all, repeatedly mention that
spirits are lonely, and long to be seen — is

233
00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:03.590
he truly so different?

234
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.990
Their connection, while brief, causes Asako
to collapse — just as Yoshiki is in view.

235
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:14.370
In a frantic state, he fears that Hikaru may
have killed her.

236
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.280
The-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru expresses confusion
at these anxieties.

237
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.000
He struggles to grasp the distinction between
life and death.

238
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.700
Not a foreign concept to him, entirely, but
he simply sees no empirical difference between

239
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.920
something alive, and the same thing while
dead.

240
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.780
Thankfully, Asako regains consciousness, having
merely fainted.

241
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:40.159
Remarkably, her first concern isn't for her
own well-being but for Hikaru's.

242
00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:45.580
She recognizes that he's been possessed and
seems willing to help, but Yoshiki cannot

243
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.830
bear the weight of it all and decides to depart,
leaving Hikaru to ponder the profound questions

244
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.130
of life and death alone.

245
00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:00.450
Hikaru wrestles with existential questions,
contemplating the meaning of being alive.

246
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.640
He dreads the thought of losing those he cares
about, especially Yoshiki.

247
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.929
He's uncertain whether his thoughts are truly
his own or remnants of the old Hikaru's consciousness

248
00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:13.650
lingering within him.

249
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.169
What he fears most is that he may have irreparably
driven Yoshiki away.

250
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:23.740
However, when Yoshiki unexpectedly appears
at Hikaru's doorstep on Monday, offering to

251
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:29.190
take him to school, Hikaru is both astonished
and elated.

252
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:35.289
To his compounded delight: Yoshiki proposes
to cut class and embark on a day of fun together.

253
00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:39.809
They visit the movies, savour popsicles, and
spend time reading manga.

254
00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:45.020
For the first time since Hikaru's transformation,
it feels like Yoshiki is making an earnest

255
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.190
effort to bring happiness into Hikaru's life,
reminiscent of the days of their youth, before

256
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.409
Hikaru's apparent demise and the arrival of
the new Hikaru.

257
00:19:55.409 --> 00:20:02.450
Yet, Yoshiki's intentions take a shocking
and brutal turn as he plunges a knife into

258
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.299
Hikaru's abdomen.

259
00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:11.210
His plan was to grant Hikaru one final day
of joy before ending his existence, but Hikaru

260
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.710
does not succumb.

261
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.940
Hikaru’s physical form does not have the
same limitations as a normal human.

262
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:25.250
Overwhelmed by despair, Yoshiki realises that
things can never return to the way they were.

263
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.080
This new Hikaru will not release him from
his grief.

264
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.620
Consequently, he implores Hikaru to kill him.

265
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:40.110
Instead, Hikaru chooses to demonstrate his
trust for Yoshiki, by giving himself a mortal

266
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.990
vulnerability.

267
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.799
Reaching into himself, he pulls roughly half
of his spirit from his body, and condenses

268
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:50.590
it into a small stone for Yoshiki to keep.

269
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:57.280
With Hikaru’s spirit now ‘small’ enough
to be harmed by lethal force, he hopes Yoshiki

270
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.040
can trust him.

271
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.840
Deciding to move forward as friends, the boys
stand before another hurdle: to truly trust

272
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:12.610
each other, they need to know what the-thing-that-replaced-Hikaru
was before it became Hikaru.

273
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.560
The why and the how already known.

274
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:22.190
Yoshiki takes the fragment of Hikaru’s spirit
and decides to help him find out what he really

275
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.190
is.

276
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:30.730
During their investigation they discover their
little village, called Mount Hope, was once

277
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:38.460
a much larger domain, but near the end of
the Edo period, split into the five smaller

278
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.380
villages it exists as today.

279
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.779
The split was caused by famine, economic strife,
and a number of strange, unexplainable deaths.

280
00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:55.470
Locals attribute those deaths now to the Lord
Brain Snatcher, a malevolent god within the

281
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.650
mountainous forest that plagued the people
of the domain.

282
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.700
But it’s believed to have been trapped within
the boundaries of the forest ever since the

283
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.419
famine.

284
00:22:05.419 --> 00:22:11.090
Like the deaths might have actually been sacrifices
in a protective ritual against it.

285
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:17.380
And Hikaru’s family, for centuries, have
been the protectors of the boundary.

286
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.990
Going into the mountains to conduct a ritual
that would keep solid the barrier between

287
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.799
the realm of the Lord Brain Snatcher and the
human world.

288
00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:32.549
But when Hikaru died performing it, and then
came back, he brought something back with

289
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:34.650
him.

290
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.310
Is Hikaru the Lord Brain Snatcher?

291
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.010
Or is he something else?

292
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:46.610
This, as of now, is where the story has left
off…

293
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.130
We can see Hikaru as dead, possessed by an
imposter.

294
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:57.460
But shunning this new creature doesn’t change
the fact that the original Hikaru is gone.

295
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:04.310
Alternatively, we can observe this spirit’s
intervention as a chance encounter to allow

296
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.480
Hikaru to live on.

297
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.190
I consider the latter more optimistic.

298
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.490
Aren’t people always changing anyway?

299
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:18.440
A person cannot walk through the same river
twice — they are no longer the same person,

300
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.960
nor is it the same river.

301
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.990
What is this possession but another, albeit
radical, form of change?

302
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.500
The alternative is that Hikaru stays dead.

303
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:36.530
The lingering question hanging in the air
is the mystery of intention.

304
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.279
What is this story trying to say?

305
00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:45.240
Perhaps it’s as indicative of queer experiences
as I’ve outlined — indeed it is focused

306
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.880
on a queer character.

307
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.799
But how does the author plan on moralising
this?

308
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.309
What should we DO about the monster?

309
00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:55.460
Is the monster even something to be feared?

310
00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:01.260
Or is this a looming cautionary tale about
‘mixing’ with the others?

311
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.220
This is information we do not as of yet have.

312
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.670
Mangakas are notorious for their anonymity
— and for good reason.

313
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.179
For manga — what is on the page, is what
is intended to be read.

314
00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:19.350
Everything else is what you bring and take
away from it.

315
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.100
Only as the tale unfolds will we understand.

316
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:28.919
And what this has to say about mixing — that
depends entirely on what Hikaru is.

317
00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:33.539
Is Hikaru truly the Lord Brain-Snatcher?

318
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.410
There are many spirits…

319
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.730
perhaps he is another?

320
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:42.750
After all, the elder council references Kubitachi's
Burden… is this the Brain Snatcher?

321
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.820
Or something else?

322
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.110
A protective force created to keep the evil
spirits within the dark domain of the mountain

323
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.640
forest?

324
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.200
Perhaps this is what Hikaru is instead.

325
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.880
However, I choose to believe the resolution
will support a mixing of human and spirit.

326
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.750
They are not without vulnerabilities… and
we are not without strengths.

327
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:09.590
After all, there are various humans in this
story who generate as much — or more — threat

328
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.570
than the lonely, needy spirits.

329
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:19.799
And there are some who are even as hostile
and chaotic as the malicious ones.

330
00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:25.049
We fear the spirits only because we are not
familiar with their intentions.

331
00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:29.080
In English we have a phrase: better the devil
you know.

332
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.880
I generally prefer to trust creators, and
people in creative fields for having the best

333
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.669
of intentions — for leaning towards social
growth and acceptance, leaning towards ‘mixing.’

334
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:44.610
At least… until they show their true colours
otherwise.

335
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.830
Art speaks to a need for human connection,
anthropologically.

336
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:54.899
The role of art across the human experience
is to bring people together through universalities

337
00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:58.419
of life and existence.

338
00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:05.110
Biography or allegory make no difference — the
goal is connection.

339
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:12.309
To be seen and to see another; to find joy
in commonalities, to normalise what the divisive

340
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:16.450
nature of society considers taboo.

341
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:24.309
Art for the sake of division, or isolation
is of no use to us — perhaps it cannot even

342
00:26:24.309 --> 00:26:26.270
be called art.

343
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:31.880
Art meant to warn people against ‘the other’
is art that’s intention is divisive, not

344
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.940
connective.

345
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.279
Art meant to unite one group of people just
to exclude another is to pander to the archaic

346
00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:45.200
days of human tribalism, for which thousands
of years of art have been tirelessly trying

347
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.190
to correct.

348
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.750
Perhaps because I recognize a connection between
this half-way-dead boy, his confused best

349
00:26:53.750 --> 00:27:00.090
friend, and a world which wants to keep them
apart; I see this example of art trying to

350
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.000
argue that our need to connect is stronger
than our ability to separate.

351
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.860
And instead of shunning what we don’t understand,
or what we fear, Hikaru will teach us to show

352
00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:22.321
empathy, compassion, and patience to those
who are different, who don’t fit in, and

353
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:30.900
even those who are, by many, considered monsters.

354
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.230
