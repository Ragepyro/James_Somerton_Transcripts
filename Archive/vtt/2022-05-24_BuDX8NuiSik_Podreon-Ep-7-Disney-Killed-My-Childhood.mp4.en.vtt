[Music]
hello hello everyone welcome to this

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.519
week's episode of the patreon
my name is james i'm

3
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.400
and i'm not here right now
he's not um we're recording this early

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.080
um no i'm also projecting from ontario
yeah

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.160
we're recording this early because nick
is going on a trip to see his family for

6
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.280
the first time in two years
so if we say anything off color because

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.960
something has happened in the world
that we would not have been able to

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.440
predict uh we preemptively apologize i
can't imagine we would though i don't

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.640
really like unless i don't know we might
make fun of someone who's dead or

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760
something yeah yeah

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
although i'm of the philosophy that dead
people are not beyond reproach like just

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.000
because they're dead
yeah

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.840
sorry nancy reagan like
i don't want to say nice things about

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.520
you because you're dead the bushes

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.799
any how is big cheney still alive
because he's a robot

16
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.240
this is procedurally replacing
like i mean like it's you can't write

17
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.520
irony as good as this the fact that he's
had to have his heart replaced so many

18
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.400
times yeah i mean isn't it a pig's heart
now

19
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.920
i don't that actually sounds familiar
but like just like

20
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.840
he wears out his heart so quickly yeah
like

21
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.880
which is like wow
no in a metaphorical context like you

22
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
know the guy has no heart yeah his heart
shrivels up inside of his chest because

23
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
he's heartless he's a [ __ ] grinch
um he's someone that i will not be shy

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.720
about saying bad things about if he dies
i mean we as a society need to get more

25
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.520
comfortable talking about that yeah we
need to stop pretending that nancy

26
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.680
reagan was a good person hillary clinton
said a champion of human rights

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.759
i'm like direct quote
at least bernie had the sense to just

28
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.560
say as little as possible like bish she
let her friend

29
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.440
her good friend
just die of aids

30
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.319
and gave no [ __ ] zero [ __ ] and it's
not like she could have saved him but

31
00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.599
you know they could have allocated some
money to

32
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.360
you know aids stuff anyway but it came
to like the reagan administration she

33
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.680
honestly pulled the strings like she
twisted her twist her [ __ ] mind

34
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.920
reader
she could twist her husband's arm so far

35
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.720
at almost as far as his donors um anyway
we're not here to talk about that no

36
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.840
we're not um

37
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.360
start we're actually here to talk about
what gives us joy

38
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.040
and
what has stopped giving us joy and this

39
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.680
tarp week has storped and this stuff
because last week uh we were talking

40
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.519
about um last week on the padreal we
were talking

41
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.159
just like the old comic books don't like
c issue 262. um i had an episode 262. oh

42
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.879
god uh but yeah um
are trixie and kochi even on no no they

43
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.599
just close to 200. okay they're almost
200.

44
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.720
um
but we were talking about how

45
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.159
you know like sent like what we do to
kind of unwind and i was like you know i

46
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.120
don't really have anything anymore and i
am feeling

47
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.560
very rudderless
in my ability to diminish my stress

48
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.760
level
um and so we got the idea like why don't

49
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.879
we just talk about that like i can talk
about it

50
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.440
um

51
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.720
so
things that we're a fan of

52
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.720
well yeah uh let's start off we're fans
of yeah the positive like some things

53
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.319
that bring me joy yeah like
obviously you know like playing

54
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.159
minecraft and lego and stuff like that
media wise things that consistently

55
00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.560
cheer me up are like bob's burgers
um

56
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.480
i can re-watch bob's burgers on a loop
grace and frankie which ended recently

57
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.400
but i still watch all the time 30 rock
every now and then you put the series 30

58
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.439
rock um the christopher and eric podcast
tdp tdps presents christopher and eric

59
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.440
podcast that's uh eric shaw quinn and
christopher rice they're fabulous what

60
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.799
we do in the shadows
let's see i've never really i love what

61
00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.199
we do in the shadows but i've never
really re-watched it i'm gonna re-watch

62
00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.040
it just because i really want to um um
but like uh other pot the bad gays

63
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.440
podcast i've listened to a bunch of that
uh things like that that just kind of i

64
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.199
can listen to or watch and
they kind of lift me up a little bit

65
00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.520
um
whereas

66
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.680
it's a nice breather from
you know being on twitter and just

67
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.880
seeing
hellfire and brimstone rain down upon me

68
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.280
i think that's why i'm so negative
lately is like twitter is kind of my

69
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.360
go-to like default place to exist in
yeah that's not good yeah i should stick

70
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.000
i should go back to the the free the
free patreon and the free discord um

71
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the free patreon i've got some bros hoes
and

72
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.120
those
non-binary people peeps friends there

73
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.400
yeah we talk a lot
um

74
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.240
so like i i am
i am kind of at a remiss for things that

75
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.880
really kind of just give me that sense
of belonging and sense of like existence

76
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.880
um

77
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.479
what i i i i i
i i'm trying to play off of you

78
00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.600
oh i thought like
i thought that you wanted to talk about

79
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.120
like
the marvel situation well yeah but like

80
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.800
that's better when it's discussion
okay so

81
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.440
um
i feel like i'm being read for film oh

82
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.840
yeah because you're on your computer
i'm sorry yeah and so like i have the

83
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.720
computer open so i can look stuff up
it's hard for me to engage with you when

84
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.759
you're clicking through things
okay sorry

85
00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.360
um because then i'm just that's kind of
just on me to just talk ad nauseam which

86
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.639
normally isn't a problem but i do feel a
little bit self-conscious when i do have

87
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.759
to do too much of that
okay um usually you get angry at me for

88
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.840
talking too much well yeah but i also
hate being left out on a on the end of a

89
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.880
stick stick branch stick branch wrench
branch stick french brick it's a gay

90
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.120
brick stench
stanch okay

91
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.479
um
so yeah one thing that you that like for

92
00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.280
a very long time you in particular like
that brought you a lot of joy was

93
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.520
the marvel just not the mcu but marvel
comics like the whole marvel universe i

94
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.120
used to be a pretty big fan of things
like i was a big star wars fan i never

95
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.400
lead games with the extended universe
because i didn't really like a lot a lot

96
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.639
of it had this stank on it
um yeah like some of the extended

97
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.199
universe like the original thrawn
trilogy by timothy zahn was like

98
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.440
in my opinion the perfect sequel trilogy
and then there were other things like

99
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.680
princess leia's only first appearance in
a novel was she was spending the time

100
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.440
planning her wedding and
she was switching her name to leia solo

101
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.440
even though the house of organa was a
royal house of alderaan and now we've

102
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.720
learned solo is a bastard name yeah and
and so she was just okay switching her

103
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.039
name to like that daenerys snow yeah and
and even like the with the new trilogy

104
00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.400
you know like um ben solo like no that's
ben organa yeah like you like like and

105
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.880
once once again we are trapped in our
weird judeo-christian

106
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.039
people
it's not judeo-christian it's

107
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.639
yeah because the the the
the jewish culture is matriarchal yeah

108
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.680
um so it's it's it's it's specifically a
patriarchal handing down your name from

109
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.639
your father the reason that uh women had
to change their names when they got

110
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.120
married to a man is so that the child
would have the father's name yeah um

111
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.960
because the child was automatically give
given the mother's last surname i saw a

112
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.120
tweet last night of some [ __ ] saying
how um trans people are evil and hateful

113
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.039
to their parents because they change
their names and when you change any part

114
00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.199
of your name you are disassociating from
your parents and you're saying that what

115
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:12.560
your parents gave you wasn't good enough
sounds like a parent of a trans child

116
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.759
and i just love all of the comments
we're like

117
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.120
what about when a woman changes her name
after she gets married it's like that's

118
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.319
different no no
i've seen a lot of trans people actually

119
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.759
really complain about that like okay i
changed my first name

120
00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:29.440
why is it taking you months to figure
that out when before the wedding even

121
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.399
happens it's mrs whomever for for a
cousin or something which i actually

122
00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:37.120
liked um
a guy i follow

123
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.200
uh
he's trans and he was talking about

124
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.120
he was retweeting this and he was like
ha checkmate i let my parents pick my

125
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.279

126
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.640

156
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.839
like and i pull a quote from the
internet it's like almost identical

157
00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.880
uh
yeah like like we were saying like bob's

158
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.200
burgers is something that gives me a lot
of joy and nice segue back into the

159
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.240
topic
you were talking about

160
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.959
uh star wars so how has star wars gone
from something that you love to

161
00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.760
something you have well like i said the
the extended universe was always a

162
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.440
little bit stanky like even like i
engaged with the video games because i i

163
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.279
like lucasart as the company even though
they had

164
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:31.519
they were at a pretty much like 50 50 in
terms of hits and misses but their hits

165
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.800
were hits
and that they hit hard

166
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.160
um so like engage with their because
they um especially like the next

167
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.000
republican and honestly that's what the
public too is shafted so hard it could

168
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.320
have been so much better uh i wonder if
for the remake of knights of the old

169
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.480
republic if they're going to smush them
together i'm so

170
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.040
excited that they will and afraid that
they will

171
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.240
because like there is a lot it that's
totally public too in terms of just how

172
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.480
much game is there
is like five times as much and that's

173
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.120
the problem this oblivion was shot had
to

174
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.560
com was uh put under crunch to complete
it yeah and so so much had to get cut

175
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.040
from the final game and the final game
was so buggy but it was so good because

176
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.560
i feel like there's no promise of the
sequel

177
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.760
because like as far like i haven't
played them because the game what i

178
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.480
would like to see what i would like to
see

179
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.839
is for them to kind of they can't do the
rev reveal so they need to have

180
00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:31.440
something else going on to kind of drive
the narrative tension like i i wouldn't

181
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.880
be surprised if it's actually revealed
fairly early on that you are revan just

182
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.720
to kind of get it out of the way um and
like let's get some something else out

183
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.839
there i don't know because like when you
actually look at how many copies of

184
00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:45.360
knights of the old republic sold
not that many but the thing is like you

185
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.240
know like it's going to be on gaming
news media

186
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.480
everywhere yeah um so like you know
twitter will be a light kind of like i

187
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.480
don't know kind of like you know like oh
we're going to the game we're going to

188
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.120
get to the rev reveal and it's like it
happens like two hours into the game

189
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.160
like what yeah um like that's a reveal
and then like something and then you

190
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.880
find out do you know who was planning it
all along

191
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.920
[Laughter]

192
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.959
the same time travel that was used to
save ashoka in uh rebels um

193
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:23.279
palpatine did that he went but when when
rey killed him he actually used the

194
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.800
force to go back in time to
retroactively conquer the guy and that's

195
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.600
what spurred everything that's why
there's a remake and not just the

196
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.160
original game because the the timeline
diverged

197
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:38.399
oh god

198
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:44.639
disney don't do it so it's not there's
no doubt behind it all right there okay

199
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:48.320
okay because it's not ea it's not ea
okay i thought it was like an indie

200
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.920
studio anyway i'm getting excited um so
yes i think something gives me joy

201
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.279
because like what anyways what i'd like
to see is like have the game the big

202
00:13:55.279 --> 00:14:00.320
reveal have hints to other things that
will prelude the second game like kind

203
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.560
of reference crea reference some of the
other masters reference the seth seth

204
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.440
triumvirate um and that way like if the
game does do well you can make a sequel

205
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.360
that not only picks off on this game but
can conti can because we have account

206
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.240
migration now can pick up where we where
you left off with revan yeah um so that

207
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.560
you can have like two uh customizable
characters both revan and the exile

208
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.959
um
anyway

209
00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:28.880
so yeah so as you can tell star wars
used to be like your star wars used to

210
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.800
be your thing yeah yeah the mythology
the larger mythology not the massage

211
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.720
star wars for me was always like it was
something i enjoyed but it wasn't like

212
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.639
my thing i was like i was a fan of star
i became a fan of star wars the same

213
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:44.160
time i was a fan of wrestling so
wrestling was my thing yeah that was

214
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.240
your thing like star wars was something
fun but wrestling was like

215
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.920
that was like yeah because like i like
my jam about star wars is like i really

216
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.639
like the philosophic the female
philosopher philosophical aspects and

217
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:02.240
not the metaphysical bits that everyone
in the fandom clings to like oh the

218
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.399
light side versus the dark side no i
liked the ethics of like what to do with

219
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:11.519
power what to do with vulnerability um
whether it's more important to save your

220
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:15.440
friends in cloud city or train with
master yoda for a while so that you can

221
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.360
guaranteed a take down the emperor
short-term gains versus long-term stuff

222
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.720
yeah and like you know like the the more
kind of uh taoist referential

223
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.680
elements of the force that the fans
continuously

224
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.920
ignore that taoism is a real philosophy
and they could use that to well fans and

225
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.839
modern creators can like use as a model
for creation instead of focusing on this

226
00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:40.160
kind of hashed out like force gods thing
that was introduced in freaking rebels

227
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.600
yeah um
no no no no that wasn't introduced in

228
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.560
rebels that was introduced in
uh as i recall in the the final books

229
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.560
that were published in the original
extended universe

230
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.199
that law i think the book was like it
was like 23 23 books in the series it

231
00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.959
was in there that those
force god type things were created yeah

232
00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:05.920
which i with malik no not malik i i just
think that's dumb i think that is so

233
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.800
dumb um i the force as like you know a
god that's dumb

234
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.320
it's more interesting if it is an
amorphous

235
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.040
uh morally ambiguous um energy source
like they say it flows through all

236
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.959
things taoist philosophy um and that you
know like jedi accrue their power by

237
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:27.839
um
relinquishing their free will and

238
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:31.279
succumbing to what the force wants them
to be where they need to be and that's

239
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:35.360
how they can overpower the sith because
the force is behind them whereas the

240
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.519
sith drive their power from essentially
swimming against the flow swimming

241
00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:43.040
against the current yeah um weak
swimmers will perish

242
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.759
strong swimmers will thrive yeah um and
so that's why the dark side obvious

243
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:50.480
skates
um the agitator's ability to perceive

244
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.680
the future because their will is
superseding what the force wants yeah uh

245
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.680
and so like the south philosophy in this
context is like it's one sith versus the

246
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.360
entire universe and so a truly powerful
sith will be able to dominate and

247
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.839
redirect direct their force to their
will right um which is way more

248
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.439
interesting than there were some gods
once and they had a disagreement about

249
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:15.600
something and now all of our squabbles
are basically derived from their um

250
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.199
their willpower and their objectives
yeah and that just sounds boring it

251
00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:23.360
doesn't it closes down the number of
available plot lines so we can already

252
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.720
see where i'm beginning to sort of
distance myself from stars but i kind of

253
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.480
kept on like okay this isn't
this is quote official star wars

254
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.880
merchandise but it's tough george
lucas's approach to approving um

255
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.559
extra media content was like basically a
shrug and a nod yeah um because i've

256
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:42.640
even seen
a lot of um

257
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.440
aboleth was like the the demon that
star wars creators of these books kind

258
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.640
of point out like yeah i made some
mistakes about these things it was late

259
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.919
at night when i was writing it's like
okay but it's your job

260
00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:56.960
the way i kind of look at it is and you
know this is also something that i'm

261
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.520
having a problem with with
disney's ownership of star wars is that

262
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:08.240
there doesn't seem to be a guiding force
to make sure enforcement there's no to

263
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.679
make sure they're doing dark side stuff
they're swimming against the flow to

264
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:16.320
make sure that everything fits that
there's someone who's like okay so

265
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.120
here's the book pitch for a new leia
book and in this book bloody bloody blog

266
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.640
because there are star wars nerds out
here who know all of this who can say

267
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.360
actually no that can't happen because in
you know

268
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.720
uh 22 bby
this happened and this happened and so

269
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.799
that can't happen because that
contradicts something that happened

270
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.640
between empire and jedi yeah and because
they exist

271
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.080
they have already done the research for
free all you gotta do is well yeah i

272
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.799
know but like all you gotta do is pay
them like

273
00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:49.120
this wikipedia is like kinda cringe
because everyone contributing takes it

274
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.480
so
seriously but that's the thing is that

275
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.240
you need someone who takes it you know i
mean like you know like that like disney

276
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.919
does you know how in rise of skywalker
how we had the gay kiss of the autofocus

277
00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:04.160
gay kiss for like um
about one and a half seconds three and a

278
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.000
half seconds and then it cut away to the
slug thing yeah um that slug has a name

279
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.080
that slug is gendered male
and because you know space slugs have

280
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.840
gender um
which is another thing that bothers me

281
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.520
about the fandom as a whole is that they
impose our very

282
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.960
uh
christian puritanical remnant values on

283
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.919
space societies
um

284
00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:31.200
yeah
uh and so like you know like that thing

285
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.960
has a name it has a backstory everything
is there and it's like

286
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.960
can't a slug just be a slug yeah and as
wikipedia is constantly compared against

287
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.799
the transformers wikipedia um i forget
which one it was but it's a specific one

288
00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:46.960
that kind of oh transformers is worse it
kind of acknowled it it tells you the

289
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.480
details well there's so many different
canons in turn i know but it takes that

290
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.760
into consideration it doesn't sort of
say like in some versions this happens

291
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.840
in summers apparently
the transformers wikipedia

292
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.039
actively acknowledges that there are
contradictions and diff and problems

293
00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:03.679
with this media and that there are
outrageous things and it's kind and kind

294
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.760
of approaches it with more
tongue-in-cheek sort of thing i like

295
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.880
this i'm on wikipedia right now and
there's actually a thing at the top

296
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.440
where you can look at the canon version
of something and then the legends

297
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.840
version of something i like that yep
it's been there since they um reset it

298
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.720
since disney was like
um i love that disney uh immediately

299
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.200
nixed the extended universe and the
first thing they did is [ __ ] with

300
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.960
lightsaber crystals which was one thing
that no one really complained about and

301
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.320
everyone really really liked the way
that it was before is that jedi

302
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.320
mind their crystals for their
lightsabers the sith synthesized them uh

303
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.280
because they couldn't have access and
synthesized lightsabers were red yeah

304
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.400
and synthesized lightsabers were red and
the sith took that as this is a

305
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.159
indication of our power and superiority
because we can create with the jedi

306
00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:51.280
repurpose yeah and that fits even like
cleanly into the overlying philosophies

307
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.280
of the jedi and the scene
i even liked that playing into episode

308
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.880
seven where it was like kylo ren did it
and he kind of was lazy about it and

309
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.799
that's why his lightsaber was amazing so
much lore that you just threw away

310
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:07.679
because the ashoka book said oh no the
lightsaber crystals start crying when

311
00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:10.720
they kill someone

312
00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:14.720
[ __ ]
so we are seeing the cracks in where i

313
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.840
started to distance myself from star
wars because i could ignore the books

314
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.640
the books did their own things and you
know like you said there was no guiding

315
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.159
hand george lucas didn't give a [ __ ]
yeah which i must say

316
00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:28.080
as of star wars like i said i was never
a huge fan of star wars like although i

317
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.960
probably played rogue squadron more than
almost any game other than wrestlemania

318
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.799
yeah like i had like rogue squadron
wrestlemania 2000 were my two games on

319
00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:40.400
n64 that i played to death
um

320
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.520
like i don't know how the character is
george lucas didn't give a [ __ ] i mean

321
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.320
that in a very loving way like that
wasn't his baby those were other things

322
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.000
babies he didn't really yeah his baby
was the movies yeah and everything and

323
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.520
he wanted he wants in the video games he
had a huge hand in those like like he

324
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.320
was but he wanted star wars to kind of
be like an open source kind of thing

325
00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.080
yeah yeah um which you know god bless
him um

326
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.200
disney is going in the opposite
direction i hate them uh but

327
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.760
we'll get back to that yeah um but like
i was never a huge star wars fan and

328
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.039
like in the last couple of years the two
things that have come out of star wars

329
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:15.039
that have been my favorite things have
been obviously the last jedi was that

330
00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:19.440
which i recently released a short little
video about uh how the last jedi gives

331
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.039
me hope which has like no views and you
converted a few but you confronted a few

332
00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:26.240
people did you convince a couple of
people who hated last jedi success and

333
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.799
their fallen order was also not just
because cameron monahan fallen order was

334
00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:36.159
like a legitimately good story i loved
how they did it like it was so good like

335
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:40.080
it it's hard for me to get into
narrative video games but fallen order i

336
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.360
just dove into and adored and it wasn't
just because i got to stare at cameron

337
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.039
monahan the whole time it was like it
had good gameplay and good good

338
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:52.480
mechanics i am super [ __ ] excited for
the sequel yeah yeah but like

339
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.960
i liked the first season of the
mandalorian didn't love it

340
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.720
uh i have a stuffed baby yoda i don't
care if his name is grogue who's baby

341
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.799
baby
um

342
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:08.799
i have a stuffed baby yoda um
uh you got the the mandalorian ship

343
00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:13.919
which has been blown up yes i love that
as soon as they establish a um household

344
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:18.880
iconogra icon uh they destroy it
yeah for no reason it's like you don't

345
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.000
destroy the millennium falcon in the
second [ __ ] movie it's like renaming

346
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.080
the slave one two boba fett [ __ ] it's
just stupid yeah because boba fett's a

347
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.240
hero now and as a hero he doesn't engage
in bounty hunting and and they tried to

348
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.039
make him a hero and everybody hated it
and that's why his show had really bad

349
00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:36.559
ratings um
the two best episodes of his show were

350
00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:41.200
the ones where mando came back yeah um
but uh

351
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.640
i didn't watch the boba fett i watched
one episode of boba fett i think i

352
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.440
watched one episode of the second season
the mandalorian that's the one where

353
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.640
luke shows up at the end
um so bad

354
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:57.039
like i i have not been in and i hated
episode nine um have not been into star

355
00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:01.840
wars whole bunch lately and this makes
me sad because i was on top of star wars

356
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.880
media that excuse me that wasn't books
like new movies new games i consumed it

357
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.360
all
and like this is and i'm sure you've

358
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.320
been listening as you've been listening
you've noticed that i've pointed out

359
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.679
some things that i'm very not happy with
and where george lucas and this is this

360
00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:19.039
is like kind of a new development
because like when episode seven was

361
00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:23.840
coming out we went to see that like
three times opening weekend yeah like

362
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.799
we like star wars night that they they
they that toys r us was um

363
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:32.480
uh so we were in line for the toy room
at midnight yeah and then we couldn't

364
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.440
get any so i went to walmart at 6 00 a.m
the next morning and grabbed them um

365
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.360
and like we were excited for that we
liked it the last jedi was fantastic but

366
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.279
then star wars has just been kind of
having a [ __ ] [ __ ] having a [ __ ] that's

367
00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:48.400
a good way to put it having a [ __ ] um so
like

368
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.840
star wars
was and to sort of explain how important

369
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.679
this is to me star wars is the
formative media of my life of my ability

370
00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:01.520
to craft stories of my ability to
generate characters um it it was the

371
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.880
foundation of how i wanted and still
want to kind of impart emotions to

372
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.679
people who consume my media yeah um
for whatever reason emotional simplicity

373
00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:18.960
philosophical mixing with action like
empire strikes back is like just so good

374
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.000
well yeah but it was like star wars for
you was like batman for me yeah and well

375
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.240
i have this
i have i've read like you know the

376
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.039
batman comics like i have a shelf full
of batman uh comics collected like all

377
00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:38.320
of the major storylines um from no man's
land nightfall like all three volumes of

378
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.960
nightfall um obviously you know like
year one dark knight returns all of that

379
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.559
kind of stuff um quarterbacks i think
you have the court of allah the court of

380
00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:49.679
owl's the man who laughs like all of it
yeah like i

381
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:53.279
or a couple of years i just like binged
the batman stuff because i'd always been

382
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:57.360
a fan of batman but i was like oh
there's like literally decades of batman

383
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.360
stories that i haven't read almost a
century at this point getting there and

384
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.799
so like i just kind of went through them
and read them all and i loved them and i

385
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:09.039
discovered new characters and stuff and
batman

386
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:12.080
hasn't let me down
because the batman was an amazing movie

387
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.520
yeah um but like
that was kind of my star wars since i

388
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.760
was a kid
and

389
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.919
so like it's like and just to sort of
explain like it wasn't like oh one thing

390
00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.400
and then i didn't like it and then i
turned away like a lot of the other star

391
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.080
wars bros like i loved everything unless
they did the last jedi

392
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.120
rigged my childhood like no
um

393
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.320
new star wars content hasn't wrecked my
childhood old star wars is still there

394
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.559
the prequels the original trilogy the
video games they will always be there

395
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:46.400
and i will always be able to have them
yeah but like it took so much for me to

396
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.080
officially call it quits
yeah i enjoyed so much it was at the

397
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.480
point where i was um like like a normal
dry grace fan and i did nothing but

398
00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.320
[ __ ] and [ __ ] and [ __ ] about this
stuff that was coming out um

399
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.279
uh like i said a lot of the big problem
i didn't really have a problem with the

400
00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:06.080
clone wars it was kind of distant and it
seemed kind of like interesting i never

401
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.120
really watched it um
rebels was the first thing i had to kind

402
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.000
of turn a blind eye to i watched the i
think the first half of the first season

403
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.080
um
and it kind of once again had that stank

404
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.240
on it
um

405
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.960
yeah um the thing that bothered me about
rebels specifically a the weird

406
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.679
the egregious depiction of the holocron
being it's just a fancy walkie-talkie

407
00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:35.600
that's actified by the force yeah that
was that was dumb because holocrons were

408
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.360
you know like interfaces that they were
personality interfaces that jedi

409
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.200
couldn't that force users could interact
with yeah they were places to store

410
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.240
knowledge that someone could interact
with on a per on a conversational level

411
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.159
um not pre-recorded messages
um

412
00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:56.000
says holocrons were even cooler they not
cooler isn't like they got dark and

413
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.720
gotten psychological
um

414
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.880
because sithal crunch could influence
her mind from what i read anyway and

415
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.520
that's the thing there's a lot of
contradictions it's like the bible you

416
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.279
pick and choose what you like
um

417
00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:12.480
but and you could you had the license to
do that because it was kind of george

418
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.840
lucas didn't really pretend to have any
oversight about it yeah he didn't really

419
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.559
pretend like he was like oh i need to
make sure that all these details are

420
00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:22.559
he's like no that's it's other people's
creations it's not mine yeah um he had a

421
00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:26.399
hand in making sure that the video games
were all canon or could fit into a kind

422
00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:29.360
of canon
not all of them not all of them but he

423
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.159
was like empire uh shadows of the empire
that was canon he built that around like

424
00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:38.480
um a novel a series of comic books in
the video game and you had to take in

425
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.039
all of it to get the full story of what
happened between way before 2015.

426
00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:46.880
just saying yeah um
and way better because so the empire

427
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.640
actually functioned as a game well yeah
it functioned it functioned it worked

428
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.080
because through the game you followed
dash rendar through the comics you

429
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.000
followed luke and through the novel you
followed princess leia yeah if i

430
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.600
remember correctly i might be off it
might be switched with the comics and

431
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.159
they kind of all kind of collected in
the end it was really yeah i think the

432
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:07.840
book was luke and the comics were laid
out that's interesting i i've took it

433
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.640
all in i read it all yeah i i should i
should do that thing because i only ever

434
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.080
played the game and i played it so many
times yeah i have the novel and the the

435
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.240
comments the collected comic but um so
like

436
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.440
there were you
george lucas lets you have the ability

437
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.440
to turn a blind eye to certain things
and not miss the story yeah

438
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.440
um because the most important story was
the movies yeah and that was always the

439
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.840
thing and that's why rebels really
started to piss me off

440
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.960
and clone wars too and it started to get
into like the force god [ __ ] because

441
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.840
it's like what's the point in having the
movies be the important story if you're

442
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.120
skipping that and going straight to
force gods well yeah like if the force

443
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.640
gods aren't
important enough to be in the movies

444
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.159
yeah
why did they exist so i just found it

445
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:56.480
kind of dumb and from just from like you
know like retrospect of the series

446
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.919
because when i started watching it uh it
had already finished or mostly finished

447
00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:03.840
yeah and like you know we'll say i've
watched some of rebels and i i did like

448
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.240
when i watched rebels it's not that i
didn't like the chara it was very kid's

449
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.080
cartoon though at first like with the
which is so was clone wars and the funny

450
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.960
thing is the original clone wars was nah
which is much more childishly i did

451
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.919
watch that i loved it it's much more
adult

452
00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:23.520
and so like um like that's actually
dealing with the horrors of war

453
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.520
especially like that one episode
with grievous yeah clone wars like he's

454
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.080
a slasher
does do that was a good episode did you

455
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.120
watch it yeah that's good uh clone wars
the uh cgi show did do that but like

456
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.960
from what i gathered uh the fans kind of
raving about like this one particular

457
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.640
episode was stuffed between twenty
filler i apologize about the motorbike

458
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.799
in the background
room um

459
00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:51.120
um
so

460
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.679
immediately i'm kind of going into
rebels a little bit soured because i'm

461
00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:56.960
like okay what's the point of the movies
being the spectacle if this is just

462
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.679
talking about force ghosts yeah force
gods

463
00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:06.080
and then like it did the kids cartoon
thing where luke had to train for years

464
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.360
to lift a lightsaber
and ezra

465
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.840
lift a lightsaber yeah when he's trapped
in the ice cave with these with the oh

466
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.919
right right yeah he had to focus to
really pull that off and that was kind

467
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:21.679
of a life or death situation yeah
meanwhile either you get the lightsaber

468
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:26.240
you die meanwhile ezra after a week of
training is i'm lifting rocks now yeah

469
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.559
i'm
and it just got i'm like very gary's too

470
00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:35.039
yeah yeah in a way that like i praised
avatar for not doing because you like

471
00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:40.240
katara yeah as a character you over four
seasons you see her going from act three

472
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.279
three right cora was four yeah uh same
same number of episodes though

473
00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:48.720
yeah cora had shorter seasons yeah so
like you know you saw qatar going from

474
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.679
not being able to do water bending
except by accident

475
00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:54.720
to that like kind of final season where
she's confronting she's doing blood

476
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.679
bending yeah doing blood burning the
scene where she's confronting her

477
00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:02.960
mother's murderer yeah like and she's
taking on a zula like yeah like you see

478
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.039
her progression you see her struggle um
and

479
00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:09.519
like you argue oh well kids don't have
the attention span for that yeah well

480
00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:14.159
why was avatar so successful yeah kids
hate like and this is i hate this kind

481
00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:17.600
of presenting that you know like the
natural aptitude sort of thing kids hate

482
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.559
feeling
like they can't handle it yeah like

483
00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.039
pander to but they hate feeling like
they can't do something because they're

484
00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:26.480
not immediately an expert at it yeah and
so that's why i think kids give up so

485
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.679
many hobbies because like they don't
realize every hobby even if something

486
00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:33.679
that comes naturally to you takes
practice yeah like piano or violin or

487
00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:37.440
drawing or whatever so like even though
like rebels apparently had all these

488
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.440
really great character moments i could
not get past the stink yeah and then you

489
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.240
had kathleen kennedy which no offense to
a woman is an ex as an executive i think

490
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.760
that when she had her freedom she did a
fine job she did a fine job with episode

491
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.840
seven she defined job with episode eight
and the one between row one rogue one

492
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.360
all great it's when she started reading
i think personally rogue one and episode

493
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.200
eight are probably my favorite star wars
yes rogue one was so good

494
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.799
um which you know it's a failure because
it didn't make as much money as episode

495
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.760
seven
um but anyway like so like

496
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.880
kathleen kennedy like wanted star wars
to suddenly have this kind of organized

497
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.760
through line that you didn't get from
the old extended universe where you

498
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.919
could
stop into different books and different

499
00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:21.200
comic books and it wouldn't feel like
something was violating something else

500
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.880
it's all one story the problem is that
did not happen

501
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.440
well yeah like for instance general
holdo yeah in episode eight

502
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.320
is in one of the leia books where you
get

503
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.679
all of her backstory completely
different character no no really not i

504
00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:40.240
heard it i heard that she was much
she was more eccentric but that kind of

505
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.000
played up as like okay she's like 60
years old by the time you see her in

506
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.240
episode 8. so she's you know matured but
she's still still got purple hair yeah

507
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.480
um you know her hair is still kind of uh
cotton candy

508
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.760
um
and so she's matured but you see that

509
00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.000
maturation happen um
and that works but

510
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.760
the people who didn't read the book were
like hold us a [ __ ]

511
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.440
and it's like no no no no you you need
her backstory but it's like we didn't

512
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.280
get her backstory because that's in a
book yeah and

513
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.599
a lot of people don't read
books yeah in general

514
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:21.520
let alone like specifically you know
especially the leia book which is almost

515
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.159
entirely about politics yeah
and like i think that the reveal and as

516
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.839
a critique of episode 8 i feel like
holdo's reveal is going to be like we're

517
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:33.280
finally seeing her on screen and that's
kind of how it was kind of depicted it's

518
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.320
like we haven't really earned she was in
one book and it was published like a

519
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.520
year or two earlier yeah it's like it
was a much bigger deal seeing ashoka in

520
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.359
live action yeah because you had seen
her for

521
00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:46.480
years and years in animation and now you
were seeing her in live action even

522
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.399
though she was supposed to and so like i
i've i'd always kind of known there was

523
00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:53.839
weirdness in the star wars universe like
people like there were creators who kind

524
00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:58.320
of made these really weird statements
being like there are two separate forces

525
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.920
one is light and one is dark and you can
draw from one or the other rather than

526
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.160
being the force being a neutral force
and how it's the user that brings their

527
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:12.160
own darkness yeah byod um
bring your own darkness uh

528
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.200
used to be a t-shirt um
so our recorder just had a little bit of

529
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.079
a hiccup uh the batteries died so we're
just going the

530
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:24.720
there's like two minutes that are
missing but we're just gonna skip ahead

531
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.320
to um
the thing that we started talking about

532
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.720
when we realized that the recorder had
died which was how marvel is another

533
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.480
thing that um
just kind of

534
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.599
was great and sucks now
uh so

535
00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:43.200
i'll hand it over to nick because he is
the marvel expert yeah yeah i can't

536
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.000
really call myself a marvel expert
anymore because i haven't really picked

537
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.400
up a comic book in
yeah but talk about like so like but my

538
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.119
kind of why you were a marvelous
adventure into marvel uh was i was in

539
00:35:55.119 --> 00:36:00.640
university i wasn't having a great time
i discovered wiccan and hulkling um

540
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.079
and this is back when i still had
optimism about you know characters and

541
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:07.839
you know representation i could consume
media like that um

542
00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:12.079
and so like as someone a normal person
does i was like i don't know the back

543
00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:15.180
story to this so i'm just going to learn
all of it

544
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.760
[Laughter]
so over one summer i read about 2 000

545
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.560
comic books sorry for the background
noise all of the avengers from 1963 to

546
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.400
2005 bearing a spewis a few issues in
the 90s

547
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:34.400
um and the annuals yeah um
i i i had so much stuff just kind of

548
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.280
memorized and
especially if you know how like earlier

549
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.960
comic books were written they were they
were a novel and

550
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.680
i picked up a trick um there is so much
text in these things all you have to do

551
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.960
look at the pictures yeah that's it look
at the pictures if you don't know what's

552
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.640
going on go back a few pages and start
and read a few lines of dialogue that's

553
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.240
everything you need to know and that's
to jack kirby's credit is yeah where the

554
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.000
art is so
clear and even other artists of the time

555
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.760
even if they weren't as good as jack
kirby uh and you know you look at jack

556
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.640
kirby's art and it's like this face is
wonky it's like yeah because he had to

557
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.320
put crank through like 50 issues a month
yeah um it's like and it wasn't about

558
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.280
the detail it wasn't about the you know
the facing the faces or the shading or

559
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.680
the the technique the the jack kirby was
all about the anatomy yeah making sure

560
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.000
that he told because stanley wrote the
outline for a comic book handed it to

561
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.599
jack kirby jack kirby did the entire
thing yeah and then stan lee came in

562
00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:32.480
later and added dialogue where necessary
and then he went over the whole thing

563
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.359
again and added a narration that said
exactly what the dialogue was saying

564
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:40.720
uh that was just how it worked and
that's how i learned that you could just

565
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.000
skip what was being written um so like
there was a very strong

566
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.920
urgence for comic book artists to get
the story across in pictures like

567
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.160
imagine if there's no dialogue yeah um
and

568
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.359
that's really when i started to fall out
of love with comic books is when they

569
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:02.640
stopped doing that in the mid to late
2000s

570
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.520
and it was splash pages action um the
amount of story that happened in one

571
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.800
avengers title from the 60s from the 60s
or 70s that's a that's a an event yeah

572
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.480
yeah it's now
you are i realized i was not getting my

573
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.680
money's worth i was you know like for
instance when we were working on the

574
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.880
scarlet witch video i read through some
of the older even i think they were only

575
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.760
from the 80s yeah and
yeah in three comic books there was so

576
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.680
much story three issues there was so
much story there

577
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.599
that
that

578
00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:41.680
is what would fill a six-month event
yeah marvel event crossover thing now

579
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.760
yeah yeah it was ridiculous and so i
feel kind of i felt kind of cheated at

580
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.560
first i'm like i'm a fan of this stuff
so i'm going to keep going

581
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.200
um no one also i also never was told
never to follow a comic book title

582
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.800
follow writers yeah always follow
writers don't even follow characters

583
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.760
unfortunately i follow characters which
means that some of my favorite

584
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.200
characters got dragged through the mud
by bad writers sorry not sorry

585
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.680
um
it happens

586
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.960
yeah i'm just saying like a particular
one that we're gonna get to we're gonna

587
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.760
get to to that
um

588
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.920
so i wish i had had the foresight to
follow writers even across dc and marvel

589
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.680
across other characters um i wish i'd
done that a bit more but you know i

590
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.560
stuck with the avengers the avengers was
my baby i kept at it

591
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.400
um
so there was a [ __ ] and um

592
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.040
i loved the old comic books especially
from the 80s uh the 70s were fun too but

593
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:39.119
um following avengers disassembled this
seems to be where the switch was

594
00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:44.640
when we went from having these very
descriptive pictures these smaller these

595
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.240
pages with smaller panels that showed
you and told you more

596
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.920
to an entire page of jessica drew
sitting at a table

597
00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:00.160
while steam from her coffee cups rises
over four panels yeah and like yes

598
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.320
you're getting the sense that she's
waiting

599
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.599
that was once what narration was meant
to accomplish but we don't do narration

600
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:10.400
in comic books anymore god forbid
um so comic books like it became splash

601
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.680
spectacle it became
busy it became you know like we have to

602
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.720
do as much as possible as little space
as possible and we're not doing a whole

603
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.839
lot as it is
um

604
00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:24.800
characters got put to the sidelines for
just having more action less character

605
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.920
development um
less continuity uh believe it or not and

606
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.440
i i actually kind of had this out with
hector hector did the um art for my book

607
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.359
which was referenced earlier um hector
barros is on twitter

608
00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:40.800
i mean i kind of complained as like is
this just me because he's an artist he

609
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.240
does comment he's a huge comic fan like
is this just me or is this like actually

610
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.880
happening it's like no this is something
that i've noticed with the industry is

611
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.079
they they're way too busy there's too
much going on one page

612
00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:54.480
you know the comic book where super
super boy john um meets his boyfriend

613
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.200
yeah um i could not figure out what was
going on across a page

614
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.440
so much stuff was happening panels were
overlapping yeah um things were bleeding

615
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.960
out of panels into other panels it's
like how do i read this yeah and it's

616
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.520
like because there's so much um emphasis
on flash and awe and i completely get

617
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.079
that it's kind of hilarious that reading
american comic books

618
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:20.079
it's
even it's so hard to follow sometimes

619
00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:23.040
where it's like wait
where you think you're following where

620
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.760
the next dialogue thing is but it's like
no it's actually at this other part

621
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.800
who's talking right now the dialogue
bubbles are so far away from where the

622
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.720
face is like and it's so hilarious
because like reading manga even though

623
00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.400
it's backwards from what i'm you know
you're reading right to left instead of

624
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.400
left to right it's easier to follow yeah
yeah

625
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.800
um

626
00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:47.760
so yeah like that that kind of was like
kind of an initial struggle with comic

627
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.359
books but also like the content just
became so superficial yeah um it was all

628
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:56.160
about bigger
we we've talked about this a few times

629
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.920
like comic books are an episodic form of
media and episodic me means it's

630
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.240
television in book form episodic means
that this is a story that is occurring

631
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.359
regularly it is going to be projected to
the future there is no set and

632
00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:11.359
determined ending this ending this is
opposed to what i would just define as

633
00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:15.200
epic narrative even though like you know
like whatever happened to baby jane or

634
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.560
who's afraid of virginia woolf that's
technically epic in this context because

635
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.760
there is a set ending there is a
beginning middle and an end okay epic

636
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.520
versus episodic yeah um
ongoing versus episodic that's better

637
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.640
yeah
um i just know episodic is the ongoing i

638
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.000
don't anyway
closed ended versus episodic yeah so

639
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.800
marvel through the process of brian
michael bendis's um

640
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.240
crossover events brown milk appendices
you may just hear him have described as

641
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.160
having a deconstructive uh writing style
and that means he likes to take a

642
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.960
character
and basically um

643
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.880
deconstruct his character and page and
what that means is he likes to explore

644
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.480
what this makes this character tick yeah
uh he likes to sit peter park ultimate

645
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.880
peter parker down and be like okay
let's guide him let's guide you the

646
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.920
reader through elements of peter
parker's life that will help you

647
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.119
understand how peter parker thinks what
were the formative elements of his life

648
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.640
which works really well i think for like
his ultimate spider-man run because like

649
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.240
i i've read them before but i actually
just bought the first volume of the

650
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.640
ultimate spider-man omnibus which is
like huge it's like a thousand pages um

651
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.599
it's like 30 pounds
um

652
00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:27.280
and like i'm gonna read that i think
over the summer because it was

653
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.119
i never got to kind of read them in the
proper order

654
00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:34.640
um
and i think he did an incredibly good

655
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.680
job with it with spider-man really
deconstructed this is something that

656
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.599
people have said about brian miller this
says he does solo characters really

657
00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:46.960
really really well he cannot write a
team and he should be by law kept away

658
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.720
from teams
um because he can only focus on one team

659
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.760
member at a time yeah and all the other
characters become generic i need this

660
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.720
character to do this for this character
by the way i just want to say there's

661
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.359
people outside talking and i apologize
profusely if that's bothering some of

662
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:06.640
you because i know that
um it might be hard to pay attention

663
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.280
when there's voices in the background
i'm really sorry it's kind of warm we

664
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.319
need to keep the patio door open or else
have the air conditioning on which is

665
00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:14.880
also nice
um

666
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.040
i don't notice them i'm sorry um
so

667
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.480
um so that works really well in certain
situations some people just don't like

668
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.240
that deconstructive style and i don't
think that really works if you are in an

669
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.079
ongoing thing like if you're doing alias
like which was all which was never going

670
00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:37.839
to be an ongoing series that's great
because it means jessica

671
00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:42.640
jones jessica jo i was thinking jessica
drew spider woman um jessica jones

672
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.200
uh has her character progression she has
her beginning middle and end she has her

673
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.839
character development she develops the
story ends when it ends yeah and

674
00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:55.280
that's a good story that's how you tell
a good story

675
00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.079
are is an ongoing avengers title a good
place to tell that story yeah

676
00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:03.760
uh because this you're not you're
suddenly moving from a medium where

677
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.599
you're developing hyper focusing on one
character in their emotional development

678
00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:11.119
to a group of people
who have other people developing that

679
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:17.200
character who also cannot have an ending
yeah you can't develop your characters

680
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.200
in that way at the same keel that he
really wanted to and that again is one

681
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.079
of the reasons i really like manga is
because it's one yes uh mangaka

682
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:31.200
i think is is the the creators
i i think they're called mangaka um

683
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.960
they're the writers and and artists of
manga um

684
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.839
they kind of they follow it through
like dragon ball z was just one writer

685
00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:43.200
attack on titan was just one writer and
if there's more stories to tell they

686
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.800
tell more stories well yeah but like
there's there's offshoot titles from

687
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.920
like attack on titan yeah offshoot
comics that are written by other people

688
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:55.359
that the main line is just one writer
yeah and he follows it from beginning to

689
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:58.560
end and
like in many cases

690
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.800
uh mangakas have
the ending planned from the very

691
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.760
beginning and even though it might go
for they plan like okay it's going to be

692
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.119
20 volumes and maybe it ends up being
39.

693
00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:13.440
that they still have the the ending plan
it's just that things grow in the talent

694
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.400
yeah same thing with like like tolkien
said about lord of the rings the tale

695
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.920
grew in the telling breaking bad the
same thing happened yeah breaking bad

696
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.520
was supposed to be three seasons it
ended up being five that's not uncommon

697
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.280
um and sometimes can work to the benefit
of the of a piece of medium some can

698
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.400
sometimes can be a detriment when a
producer demands more seasons of a

699
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.160
series that really doesn't need it yeah
um and you know you have your series

700
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.480
where you think of where i say that but
like so having that kind of story of

701
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.400
beginning middle and end
uh doesn't work

702
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.880
if you're in an episodic storytelling
yeah um and brian michael bendis tried

703
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.480
his best to do that and what that ended
up being was

704
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.920
this isn't a bendis thing sorry i'm i'm
trying to move you along

705
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.040
um
it's it's this isn't about bendis this

706
00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.079
is right yeah i blame him because he
kind of pulled the launcher yeah but

707
00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:04.880
this this is the marvel thing um
you you you blame bendis it's the

708
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.440
editors it's not the writers but anyway
the the thing that has really

709
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.800
you were never
as depressed about marvel comics moving

710
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.040
on as you were with the mcu's recent
um

711
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.200
[ __ ] yeah um and that kind of ties in
because like as i was abandoning marvel

712
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.240
because they were kind of really leaning
heavily marvel comics marvel comics

713
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.599
because they were like every
few months there was a universe

714
00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:33.839
shattering event yeah every few months a
new a character as that was happening

715
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:38.400
the mcu was coming into fruition they
were which gave you a marvel outlet that

716
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.359
what that was doing long buildings
long buildups and it was very stable

717
00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:47.440
because there was a clear directed
oversight uh there was an understanding

718
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.200
that yes these stories will have an
ending because actors will age out of

719
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.960
the role so these characters won't be
able to be here and especially with like

720
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.640
the end of phase one kind of setting up
thanos it's like okay we know that

721
00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.640
there's a there is a if not an ending
climax

722
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.760
that is already built in thanos is going
to be a climax to this story um

723
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.920
which i think happened and i don't think
they knew what the second arc was going

724
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.599
to be and i think that's the problem of
what happened with the mcu because phase

725
00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:19.520
4 has been a
i don't want to say it's been a disaster

726
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.680
but phase four has been a hot mess
yeah a hot mess you've gotten some

727
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.319
really awesome things out of it like one
division and even the loki series

728
00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:31.839
and hawkeye i loved hakka like kate
bishop is like

729
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:35.280
kate but then i want to show just of
kate and elena yeah but then you have it

730
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.079
but then you have a situation where like
you're cut where kevin feige is like oh

731
00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:40.960
the avengers are young avengers are
coming the young avengers were coming

732
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.800
and like you have one young avenger
who's in her 20s another one who is a

733
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.680
teenager and two others who are children
yeah and so

734
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.640
i'm assuming when the young avengers do
show up kamala khan is going to be on

735
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.119
the team yeah and cassie also weird
situation right she's there

736
00:48:57.119 --> 00:49:01.280
um and so like
you have shang chi pulling the series in

737
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.119
one direction
you have black widow

738
00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:09.680
being its own thing
um you have the tv shows sending con

739
00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.800
very conflicting information about
what's the state of what this universe

740
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.880
is
and it just doesn't really seem like

741
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.280
there's
that that direction that marvel used to

742
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.240
i do not know what that noise is
um

743
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.400
that the direction that marvel used to
have is lacking and you know like

744
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.760
well yeah because it was very clear
here's my theory of what's going on with

745
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.119
marvel um
the movies for a very long time there

746
00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:34.000
were about two a year
um

747
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
and i think kevin feige had a very firm
grasp on what was happening with each

748
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.760
movie
um

749
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.000
and then it became three year and i i
think he still had a good grasp on it

750
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.800
what was going on the art the marvel
machine became a well-oiled oiled

751
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.720
machine yeah i think very well was not
too much he had directors and writers

752
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.960
and and and everyone that he trusted but
then when disney said okay we need

753
00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.640
marvel to prop up disney plus basically
and so in one year you had one division

754
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:06.240
loki what if uh american captain america
and hawkeye in one year you had five

755
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.480
marvel series on disney plus
all of which kevin feige has to oversee

756
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.119
at the same

757
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.280
black widow and spider-man oh forgot
about spider-man i thought that was this

758
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.160
would have been sony but i guess kevin
feige would have had he still yeah he's

759
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.280
still yeah so there's like
five tv shows and four movies that this

760
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.079
one man is being told to oversee yeah
and i think at some point

761
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:35.520
it's not that he lost interest or
anything like that but as we talked

762
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.800
about in the last episode i think a
burnout hits yeah like he did you

763
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.880
especially because in that one year how
many different flavors of multiverse we

764
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.880
got yeah and i think honestly here

765
00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:55.440
i think he knew like okay i am reaching
a saturation point where i am not going

766
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.640
to be able to minutely control the
things that need to be minutely

767
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.800
controlled and so
he gave the eternals to chloe zhao

768
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.400
because he's like she's an oscar-winning
director she's a fantastic director

769
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.920
she'll be able to do this but then
everyone was like this doesn't seem like

770
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.880
a marvel movie and there's way too much
here

771
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.720
and like i think i think this evening
is that the eternals was very

772
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.559
disconnected from everything else so it
didn't yeah but it still gave a stank to

773
00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.640
marvel
um

774
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.760
like
my language i think yeah like i think it

775
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.200
should have been uh mini seriously very
very serious and then i think he was

776
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.559
like okay doctor strange is safe because
i'm giving it to

777
00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:38.160
sam raimi who has already proven himself
with the spider-man movies he's you know

778
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.359
he's a you know well-known very talented
director

779
00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:45.200
but then it turns out the sam raimi and
the writer of dr strange neither of them

780
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.880
watched one division and then decided to
make a movie

781
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.000
or they have this this character
who is at the center of the story

782
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.200
who they have not done the homework for
um

783
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.400
and so
he was kind of i think handing it off to

784
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.760
them thinking they're professionals
they'll know what to do i can trust them

785
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:09.680
while i work with you know x y and z
and they were not trustworthy

786
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.359
and i think that's a problem because i
think disney is saying like we need more

787
00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:16.640
marvel stuff because that's the cash
couch yeah star wars we're trying to

788
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.880
rebuild from the bottom up because we
[ __ ] it up yeah the parks are failing

789
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.280
the parks are the parks are not doing
well uh disney plus has next to nothing

790
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.680
marvel is the cash cow marvel is what we
need and

791
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.599
it's not working like with the most
recent series moon night moon night's

792
00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:38.319
ratings were the have been the lowest of
any marvel show including what if yeah

793
00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:42.079
and luna has another character like moon
and this sucks because my two favorite

794
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:46.559
comic characters are moon knight and the
scarlet witch yeah uh for completely

795
00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:50.559
different reasons they're very
completely different characters but like

796
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:54.559
uh scarlet witch is my favorite because
like i follow i made it i wrote an

797
00:52:54.559 --> 00:52:59.359
entire video about her
two at this point but um i just love her

798
00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:03.359
progression i love what she signifies i
love her powers and i love her struggles

799
00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:08.240
it's so very human even though she is
one of the least human characters

800
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.760
yeah
excuse me and moon knight is just very

801
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.720
psychological and cerebral and it's a
very interesting take on batman and

802
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.040
marvel has a few of those they have
daredevil

803
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.240
um
yeah yeah yeah wolverine and you know

804
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.520
like moon knight as kind of like
different variants about like hey this

805
00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.440
is us doing batman and moon knight kind
of fits that more kind of violent

806
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.359
deliberately crazy version that batman
has but like very struggling

807
00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:37.599
and so like i haven't seen moon knight
yet i would like to still

808
00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:41.760
um but like i'm sad that another thing
i'm sad about is that they apparently

809
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.400
their cgi is getting worse progressively
um not necessarily

810
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:51.200
i've seen people ripping into she-hulk
yeah the thing with she-hulk is doing

811
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.640
cgi of something that's supposed to look
very human

812
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.160
is difficult yeah you get away with it
with the hulk because although he's

813
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.960
human he's very inhuman looking his
proportions are wrong whereas she-hulk's

814
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.760
proportions are right um
you know she-hulk is really just a big

815
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.880
woman yeah um and because of that
it's difficult to make it feel realistic

816
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.000
but at the same time like you know we
talk about how much marvel content sorry

817
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.520
about that but talk about how much
marvel content came out last year that

818
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:26.240
nine things and like that's a lot of
strain to put the cgi

819
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.520
uh team under at disney and disney owns
a

820
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.559
a but but you know what you know [ __ ]
off no because not you not you

821
00:54:34.559 --> 00:54:38.880
but like disney because like
like you can say like well you know the

822
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.799
special effects in x weren't that good
the special effects in one division or

823
00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:46.799
the special effects in um
doctor strange not that good special

824
00:54:46.799 --> 00:54:51.680
effects in uh spider-man not that good
like sony was literally releasing like

825
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.319
dlc
to the movie theaters with updated

826
00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:58.400
effects i've seen the trailer for
stranger things season four marvel can't

827
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.240
[ __ ] touch the special effects in
stranger things season four so why is it

828
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.440
that netflix has better special effects
than one of the largest media

829
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.359
conglomerates on the planet yeah
why

830
00:55:11.359 --> 00:55:16.000
why like answer me
tell me i need to know this is something

831
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.839
that marvel's had a huge struggle with
consistently that star wars did not

832
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:24.400
until the last movie um
that movie was such a mess it was i

833
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.760
don't talk about it it wasn't even a hot
mess it was just

834
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.599
it was like a three day old cold mess it
was a disaster disaster um

835
00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:37.280
like cold piss disaster in the same way
that like you know people kind of are i

836
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.520
heard you say that people are comparing
doctor strange to the rise of skywalkers

837
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:46.880
and critics yeah um i
because i i don't think i can bring

838
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.920
myself to watch it even though
apparently like they're horrible

839
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.119
there is still gay up heel there like i
see my gaze on twitter kind of be like

840
00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:56.640
oh my god this movie she sir like the
movie sucked but she searched i'm like i

841
00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.079
i can't engage with that well that's the
response that's basically the everyone

842
00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:03.040
who didn't like the movie was like i
hated it because of what they did to

843
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.280
wanda but she was the best part of the
movie because she

844
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.200
you know went balls to the wall yeah and
and like you know i i'm glad that

845
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.799
elizabeth olsen makes knows how to play
a good villain but it's like that's not

846
00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:19.119
wanda that's not my character yeah that
isn't who and they've made it very clear

847
00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:22.079
she's not dead she'll be coming back
there's a there's a scarlet witch movie

848
00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:25.280
in development just trying to shoot that
ending then like they've done the whole

849
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.680
thing and it's like
okay well why did you do that ending

850
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.720
then yeah
like like you said kevin feige has

851
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.880
probably stretched way too thin yeah
because you know you trust these people

852
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.400
who have done good on other things the
head writer on loki that you know sam

853
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.000
raimi
and you know they've done good things

854
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.680
and then they don't do the research and
either of them watch one division sam

855
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.720
raimi watched the first two episodes of
one division and liked it and then was

856
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.839
like okay but doesn't really realize
that the entire show is about this is

857
00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:57.920
her trauma bubble yeah that you know
it's about this woman processing trauma

858
00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.640
and grief and that's what the entire
show is about and then you and then it's

859
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.240
like the next time you see her she's the
biggest villain of the mcu dragon lady

860
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.920
bad
yeah

861
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.720
she is daenerys in the last two episodes
of game of thrones yeah and it's like

862
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.319
it's this needless flip and apparently
like one of the reasons the winds of

863
00:57:12.319 --> 00:57:16.559
winter the the new
book has been taking so long is because

864
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:22.160
when game of thrones came out yeah and
george rr martin saw that ending

865
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.160
apparently he rewrote
oh the winds of winter nice and that's

866
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.480
why it's taking so long well
that he went in and rewrote a ton of

867
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.599
chapters in that book that actually
makes me give me some makes me respect

868
00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:36.960
him a little bit
um because i know you do it faster but

869
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.040
like well yeah like he saw the disaster
that it was and was like

870
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.640
i have no doubt that if he did want to
go with the madqueen daenerys kind of

871
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.280
angle there would be more build up there
would be more build up and it would be

872
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.599
more justified but that's 2 000 pages
always my argument is that it needed it

873
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:55.520
didn't either change it just needed more
or it needed to change yeah

874
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.520
but like with marvel it's like you know
like i am so heartbroken over what they

875
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.119
did to wanda
because like the fact that that content

876
00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:06.480
managed to slip through and it's like
that's not the character in the comics

877
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.359
that's not the character that's been
built up through

878
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:12.720
uh the movies
that's not the character that i've been

879
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.640
kind of like identifying with and
putting a lot of my kind of like

880
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.520
hope and joy into and it's like i
feel it made me feel broken like that

881
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.880
kind of bro like that was kind of at the
last per last episode kind of like at

882
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.920
the peak of my burnout and i'm like i'm
frustrated because like for for years

883
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.480
literally years it was give the x-men to
disney because disney will do it right

884
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.359
and now disney has the x-men
and it's like

885
00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:43.920
oh now it's when they're losing their
grip yeah um because like unlike you i

886
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.880
am a fan of the x-men i've always liked
the x-men and the characters and the

887
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.960
stories and all of that i've always
loved it um i've always liked the movies

888
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.720
and the tv show and the comic club like
reading through the one the video that

889
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.760
came out recently like i had a lot more
x-men hate and you're like nick i need

890
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.599
to take this out yeah
uh and most of the comments are

891
00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:06.559
on it are like
why do you hate the x-men so much yeah

892
00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:10.559
there is a very avid fan base
yeah because the x-men are great

893
00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:14.400
characters like i know you don't like
them but i like the characters i don't

894
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.920
like the way that they are handled okay
well that's anyway uh let's hear under

895
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.640
there um
but like now i'm like

896
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.760
oh i don't think disney's gonna do this
right i don't think disney's gonna make

897
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.520
magneto a holocaust survivor i don't
think they're gonna go there i don't

898
00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.960
think they're going to go with the
sarajevo angle either

899
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.839
i don't think you can you've got to have
them be a holocaust survivor and i don't

900
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:38.480
think they're going to do it i don't
think they want to touch the holocaust

901
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.319
they they managed to skip over it
entirely with super nazis with captain

902
00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:45.200
america so i really don't think they're
going to even mention the holocaust and

903
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:50.160
that's probably very problematic
because the x-men are kind of innately a

904
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.760
darker kind of storyline because you are
dealing with trauma well you're dealing

905
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.839
with trauma but you're dealing with
subjugation your genocide like the

906
00:59:59.839 --> 01:00:02.960
mutant genocide too yeah like you're
you're literally dealing with a federal

907
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.480
government trying to genocide an entire
group of people and you know lots of

908
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.200
people say wanda did the genocide and
it's like

909
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.839
yeah okay whatever that's a one-time
event but

910
01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:18.079
like like this is the story of the x-men
is constant persecution and that's why

911
01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:22.960
you have people like magneto who become
quote the villain because they're sick

912
01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.960
and tired of being persecuted and you
have people like scott summers breaking

913
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.720
and becoming the villain because they're
tired of being persecuted and like you

914
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.119
can like the argument is very valid of
saying like well yeah maybe the x-men

915
01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:37.680
aren't a great example of persecuted
people because they have [ __ ]

916
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.720
superpowers but
like that is kind of the what they are

917
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.599
they are an analogy for persecuted
people

918
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:48.319
and
you know the government's wanting to

919
01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:52.240
euthanize them and get rid of them and
sterilize them and all sorts of stuff

920
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.960
and
it's like

921
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.040
i don't think disney's gonna go there no
like like like they said with the first

922
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.319
two episodes of moon night like it's
like i don't like people are like this

923
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:05.920
is i don't think disney's a great place
to have these discussions about severe

924
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.799
mental disorders
because like mental health yeah um

925
01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:14.400
well dissociative identity disorder yeah
i know but disorder

926
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.440
people don't like calling it is so
that's fair okay uh but just you know

927
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.440
like that is a
that can be a very dark

928
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.000
um area of mental health yeah um and
especially you know given mark spector's

929
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.200
history like you know you can't really
talk disney can't really talk about he

930
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.440
was a mercenary but left for dead but
resurrected um and you like talk about

931
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.920
what being a mercenary actually means
yeah um and like you know it's like not

932
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.880
like oh i get paid to like beat people
up i was like no like when you're the

933
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.319
kind of mercenary mark spector was like
in an insurrection in the middle east

934
01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:47.520
you are black helicopters yeah and
disney's not willing to have that

935
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.280
discussion there disney's not willing to
have a discussion about

936
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.839
um you know like the
uh d.i.d uh and especially it's not the

937
01:01:55.839 --> 01:02:00.079
way that split did it with um night
shyamalan yeah um so like you know like

938
01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:04.400
maybe moon knight isn't the best kind of
place to have this discussion if you're

939
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.240
like well yeah moon knight would have
been better with kind of the netflix

940
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.200
treatment where they were willing to go
a bit darker like with daredevil and

941
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.920
jessica jones and stuff like that
because like disney has said like we're

942
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.400
definitely bringing back daredevil and
jessica jones and it's like really

943
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.920
you're bringing back jessica jones
you're and like they were even talking

944
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.680
about bringing back purple man i'm like
really really disney's going to do

945
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.280
purple man is jessica still going to be
an alcoholic yeah she's still going to

946
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.119
be well i think so because tony they did
this tony stark demon in a bottle they

947
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:37.680
did he got drunk once
for most of the movie he was drunk

948
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.720
um
but like they did that so i i wouldn't

949
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.440
be surprised if they did actually i
don't remember that movie

950
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.760
but like jessica jones
and purple man specifically like that's

951
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.520
a very dark villain yeah and they
they've been talking about wanting to

952
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.039
bring him back and like bring back david
tennant and stuff and i'm like i'm all

953
01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:57.520
for you know
i want more of him because he was an

954
01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.839
amazing villain but
i don't think disney could do that well

955
01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:04.799
especially because like you know look at
the difference between uh the daredevil

956
01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:08.559
show and hawkeye show it's like both
dealt with organizations

957
01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:11.520
and daredevil was literally talking
about human trafficking look at kingpin

958
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.359
and daredevil look at kingpin and
hawkeye and like hawkeye two completely

959
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:19.280
different organized crime angle was very
much like kind of above it all it's like

960
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.799
you had the tracksuit mafia and it's
like oh you they make jokes about being

961
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:26.799
russian and uh the jokes about imagine
dragons and it's like yeah but like

962
01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:30.960
daredevil dove into
the kind of things that organized crime

963
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.359
does yeah and like i said like
taking just look at kingpin from

964
01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:39.839
daredevil the net first season of
daredevil and kingpin in

965
01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:42.640
um
hawkeye and it's like

966
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.880
in daredevil kingpin was terrifying he
was terrifying

967
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.039
and in hawkeye he was a joke yeah
so it shows

968
01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:57.520
in my opinion disney is not willing to
go where they need to

969
01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.039
if they're not willing to go dark for
their villains

970
01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:04.079
how are they going to go dark with their
heroes

971
01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:07.599
ooh that's a good angle and the easy
solution is to make them crazy and turn

972
01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:13.119
them into a villain
like they did with juan yeah

973
01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:16.880
because like god forbid you have any
kind of uh psychological nuance when it

974
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.760
comes to a character

975
01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:22.480
stop
god forbid you have any psychological

976
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.559
nuance when it comes to a woman yeah
because you know like it's okay that

977
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:30.720
bucky is struggling with his ptsd and
sometimes slips up a few times it's okay

978
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.240
that tony has trump probably and has
killed thousands hundreds or thousands

979
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.440
of people over the years that's fine and
tony committing war crimes because he

980
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.119
saw space
yeah but you know like tony creating

981
01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:45.760
ultron and all of that stuff but wanda
taking a town prisoner for a week

982
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.440
um because she needed a because her
psychology said honey you're burnt out

983
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.480
and you need a break from reality so i'm
gonna take over okay and she's like

984
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.280
please don't they're like i got this
yeah like that's and like yeah it sucks

985
01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.720
that she took away their free will for a
week that's horrible but you know she

986
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.799
didn't kill thousands of people until
doctor strange where she did

987
01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:09.039
because you know they
they they kind of lost the grasp of the

988
01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:11.440
character
um

989
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.920
and again i think it's you know kevin
feige is trying to delegate yes and he's

990
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.359
delegating to the wrong people yeah
because like you know like sam rami has

991
01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:23.839
had some hits but he's also had some
very very misses and like they've said

992
01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:26.480
like they want to do
secret wars

993
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.039
uh as the next big kind of crossover
but they're bringing back the russo

994
01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:35.119
brothers for us and i think that's kevin
feige being like i need to bring them

995
01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:37.599
back because i trust them these people
know what's going on what i don't like

996
01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:43.200
about secret wars is that they're going
back in time and doing it over the blip

997
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.400
no no that's secret invasion

998
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.960
oh

999
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.920
really confuses me because like
nick fury is the main character in

1000
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.960
secret invasion but he got
snapped

1001
01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.240
yeah it makes no sense yeah but no
secret wars

1002
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.599
is supposed to be the big
multi-dimensional crossover event you

1003
01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:06.880
know okay was you know how in spider-man
you figured out that nick fury on earth

1004
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.000
was actually the alien yeah what if it's
those two that got blipped maybe yeah

1005
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
maybe but who knows yeah um
but um

1006
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.720
um
yeah secret wars is going to be like a

1007
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.760
multi-dimensional crossover event that's
where you're going to have tom cruise as

1008
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.240
iron man that's where you're going to
probably bring wanda back like all that

1009
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.680
stuff is going to happen you're going to
get this the symbiote suit and stuff

1010
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.359
like that for spider-man that's going to
be in secret wars um

1011
01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:39.359
but he's bringing back the russos for
that because

1012
01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:43.359
it's like
i can trust them to do the job because

1013
01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:47.200
they did winter soldier they did civil
war they didn't but then again

1014
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.000
everything like the last year of marvel
and kind of just you know doing really

1015
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.520
dirty by my character in a way that i
don't understand how they can possibly

1016
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.039
redeem wanda after murdering after
genociding

1017
01:06:57.039 --> 01:07:00.000
wizards
and

1018
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.760
getting really dark with the illuminati
yeah the luminaire are not fantastic

1019
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.920
people but you know like bisecting peggy
carter snapping professor x's yeah

1020
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.240
cutting cutting peggy carter in half
snapping professor x's neck

1021
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.079
richards had it coming but the black
blowing up black bolt's head yeah

1022
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:19.520
squishing captain marvel the black
captain marvel yeah

1023
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.839
and just like
really like i i like

1024
01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:28.480
if what's it gonna take like oh and and
and spaghettifying mr fantastic like i

1025
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.599
said he had it coming uh

1026
01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.039
um
uh with the needlessly detailed

1027
01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:38.640
fantastic four suit um

1028
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.559
like i don't know what it's gonna take
to get me back on board with marvel like

1029
01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.760
i completely understand that i'm i'm not
like

1030
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.599
even thor wreck not thor ragnarok thor
love and thunder like i'm excited for it

1031
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.880
but at the same time i'm like i'm gonna
wait for the reviews before i pre-buy my

1032
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.680
tickets and even then i'm gonna go in
late so i don't have to look at chris

1033
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.920
pratt yeah um
because i love the gore the god butcher

1034
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.240
storyline in the comics i love the
mighty thor storyline in the comics i

1035
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.280
want that i wanna see that i wanna see
natalie portman jacked because she's

1036
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.039
[ __ ] jacked
uh like i want to see that

1037
01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:17.120
i don't need to see chris pratt so you
know i'll go in 20 minutes late um

1038
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.400
and you know if the reviews are like
it's amazing i'll go see it but i'm not

1039
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.640
pre-buying my tickets like i pre-bought
the doctor strange tickets um

1040
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.719
like not necessary
and you know it sucks that like for me

1041
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:31.759
for the last 10 years marvel's kind of
been in my bag like that's been the

1042
01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:36.159
thing i'm most excited about all the
time i'm always like looking forward to

1043
01:08:36.159 --> 01:08:39.279
the next marvel thing and now i'm not
looking forward to anything that marvel

1044
01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:41.920
has and we were talking about this
earlier because like i've kind of marvel

1045
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.040
was like the marvel cinematic universe
was kind of like the last thing that i

1046
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.520
was really that was really kind of
giving me any kind of anticipation and

1047
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.679
it started to wane a bit like
honestly it was during one division the

1048
01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:55.520
mephisto discourse
really beat me down

1049
01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.319
like just the constant what no not not
you like just like the the constant

1050
01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.279
speculation the oh what is this and what
is this and what is this therapy that's

1051
01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:05.839
what television is there i know but
people went through the kamala khan

1052
01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:08.400
trailer and found a black character in
the background and said is this going to

1053
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.359
be miles morales
that's what fandom is

1054
01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:17.120
you watch the trailers you watch the
shows and the movies and you speculate

1055
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.600
you were not a part of the game of
thrones discourse for eight years

1056
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.719
i was where it was just every episode it
was oh this happened

1057
01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:31.679
and oh i think this is the theorizing
that's what drives fandom i guess so but

1058
01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:36.000
like you know so like that is necessary
for media to exist that kind of wore me

1059
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.239
out a little bit but you know i was
still engaging i was still looking

1060
01:09:38.239 --> 01:09:40.640
forward to things we still watched
hawkeye

1061
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.520
um
we went to see spider-man and the

1062
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.920
eternals on opening night for each
like i was still engaged but like you

1063
01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.640
know like this kind of really pushed me
in a way and i think in a way that i

1064
01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.880
think kind of soured and and may sour
the future for me

1065
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.600
um just kind of being like like
and i get that because like i understand

1066
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.960
the frustration with what's going on not
just with wanda and moon knight but just

1067
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.080
kind of like the lack that it was so
strong for so long and now that it's it

1068
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.080
seems to be waning it seems like the
control is gone the not even the control

1069
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.960
the kind of um oversight
no the direction of

1070
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.719
sure i was going to use a word but
you're confusing me

1071
01:10:20.719 --> 01:10:24.640
but um
just that there's there's something

1072
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.679
missing now yeah and
the same thing happened with star wars

1073
01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:32.400
where star wars even with the prequels
even though the prequels aren't that

1074
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.480
great they felt special
and

1075
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.280
even like
episode 8

1076
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.760
it's like

1077
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.840
probably the worst star wars movie
episode eight yeah not episode eight

1078
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.520
episode episode two
um yeah

1079
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.640
probably attack of the clones probably
the worst star wars movie

1080
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.880
um
but when i've re-watched it

1081
01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.960
it still feels special yeah because it
wanted to show you new things well yeah

1082
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.920
it was because i think i because i
remember going to the theater with my

1083
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.360
dad and watching it and feeling yeah
like

1084
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.360
this is something new and cool george
lucas is obviously just one of the best

1085
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.120
visual storytellers that and all of the
movies gave you something new yeah

1086
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.080
whereas the disney stuff is
very obsessed with reprising the old

1087
01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.679
yeah like episode seven felt special
because it was you know it's back to the

1088
01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:28.480
millennium falcon and han and chewie and
it's all there and like all of that

1089
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.800
felt very special um but it was just
episode eight felt very special because

1090
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.480
it was like oh wow star wars is going in
a different direction

1091
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.960
and then episode nine and solo just kind
of shat all over it the tv shows are

1092
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.679
very
it's not it doesn't feel

1093
01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:48.080
special
like that's what i mean like you know

1094
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.400
when george lucas saw an opportunity to
make some things grand he took it and so

1095
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.719
when he saw an opportunity to take
things in a new

1096
01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:58.960
direction that hadn't been done before
he took it the tv shows and the star

1097
01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.440
wars movies were very hesitant to go in
any new direction yeah i know that like

1098
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.000
uh a couple of days before this podcast
is released the the obi-wan show will

1099
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.560
start on disney plus i haven't seen it
but i've seen the trailers and i get no

1100
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.199
i don't get that special feeling from
the trailer especially because they've

1101
01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:20.880
promised two fights with darth vader and
obi-wan kenobi which is just like okay

1102
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.400
so you've completely removed the power
of their confrontation in a new hope

1103
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.280
yeah
uh you know i felt a presence i have not

1104
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.760
felt since implied that you know the
last time you met each other [ __ ] went

1105
01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.800
down um not like yeah you got chopped up
not just like oh funny like funny funny

1106
01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:40.239
game to you here apparently darth vader
is german

1107
01:12:40.239 --> 01:12:43.760
it's just like funny running into you
here just like you know like just kind

1108
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.679
of gal venting across the galaxy having
lightsaber fights with darth vader like

1109
01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:50.320
yeah
it doesn't seem and it removes the

1110
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.640
component of specialness
yeah um and i think

1111
01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.440
that is
a disney thing

1112
01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.239
i think because it's all disney is so
formulaic you're right yeah he built all

1113
01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:06.719
of their new content based on feedback
from their performer content it's like

1114
01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:11.840
when was the last time an original
property came out of disney that felt

1115
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.320
special

1116
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.719
so
honestly tangled kind of

1117
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.800
i've never actually seen tangled no
tangled was a lot of fun and very well

1118
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.239
constructed as a movie better than
frozen but didn't do as well uh i think

1119
01:13:28.239 --> 01:13:32.320
because there was less to let less girl
power to latch on onto there wasn't

1120
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.159
frozen was sold on let go
if let it go had not been in frozen i

1121
01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:39.440
don't think it would have done as well
you're absolutely right um cause frozen

1122
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.960
was the first frozen was a bit of a mess
frozen two

1123
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.640
felt new and special
not an original property

1124
01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.679
that's true uh let's go back
further

1125
01:13:51.679 --> 01:13:54.239
um
apparently john carter of mars wasn't

1126
01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:59.360
that bad but i need to go back to 2003.
which one's that pirates pirates the

1127
01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.080
first pirates of the caribbean
oh that's the last time an original

1128
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.880
thing came out of disney that i was like
this is different

1129
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:14.000
i like this yeah and you know what it
was the executives got pushed away they

1130
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.120
did everything in your power to push the
executives away yeah the director was

1131
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.159
protecting johnny depp and whatever he
was doing yeah

1132
01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:22.480
like
because the directors were just like

1133
01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.640
they saw the dailies
he's got a row in the fountain is he

1134
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.719
drunk is he gay he's ruining the film
and it's like he's none of these things

1135
01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:34.320
and all of these things he's just being
a pirate

1136
01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.440
and
you know now

1137
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.320
the specialness isn't there whereas
i watch heartstopper and i'm like this

1138
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.000
feels special i watch
the

1139
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.040
you know the
everything everywhere all at once and

1140
01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.800
i'm like this feels special oh yeah and
you know we need to watch the northmen

1141
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.239
uh there are things
that are coming out that aren't disney

1142
01:14:56.239 --> 01:14:59.040
discussing that like i think that's the
problem with disney

1143
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.679
absorbing so much media is that i had
that we had we were watching chip and

1144
01:15:03.679 --> 01:15:05.920
dale we're kind of talking this the
other day it's like

1145
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.239
with disney absorbing so much media
is this just where media is going to

1146
01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:14.480
automatically sanitize itself and moving
towards that disney brand yeah and so

1147
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.840
everything feels like you know
incredibly sanitized very safe because

1148
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.159
my great criticism about chip and dale
was that they just they explained all of

1149
01:15:22.159 --> 01:15:25.920
the jokes that needed to land like um
they talk about going and going to the

1150
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.040
uncanny valley because you know like if
you're from california you know where

1151
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.000
the valley is yeah i'm a valeno
um you know what the valley is you know

1152
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
that it's kind of sketchy we're in the
we're in the valley the uncanny valley

1153
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.199
and then they explained that this is a
place where all of the old cgi

1154
01:15:41.199 --> 01:15:43.840
characters from the new year like you
could have just said the uncanny valley

1155
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.679
and then showed someone from the polar
express or beowulf

1156
01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:51.600
or something else because like you know
like the kids or final fantasy watching

1157
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.320
this
kids watching this movie aren't going to

1158
01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.120
know what an uncanny valley is they're
also not going to know get a lot of

1159
01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.400
these references because these movies
did not have staying power but

1160
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.000
explaining the jokes so that the kids
get it is going to diminish the value of

1161
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.440
the joke for the adults and make it not
funny for the kids either because they

1162
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.400
don't know what i don't think it
diminishes it for the adults i think

1163
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.120
you're kind of hyper critical on that
um i don't think it diminishes it i i

1164
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.640
think the joke is still there i don't
think the explanation ruins it

1165
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.320
um it doesn't the comedic timing is off
with the explanation though but you're

1166
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.440
already laughing before they explain it
yeah um at least i was when i watched it

1167
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.199
because i i laughed and i was like oh i
liked it better as just like the stinger

1168
01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:34.960
but yeah but um yeah you know you don't
need to explain the jokes they're

1169
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.679
explaining it for the kids who don't get
it even though the kids are still not

1170
01:16:37.679 --> 01:16:40.480
going to get it probably but it's
because they're not going to get the

1171
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.600
reference
um and so like you know like it's with

1172
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.960
me like i kind of built my life around
these kind of pieces of media and so

1173
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.600
that now that i'm kind of distancing
myself from them because they do kind of

1174
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.520
have that disney vibe to them like i'm
kind of left a little bit lost and

1175
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.120
listless like i don't really know what
to kind of gravitate towards and it's

1176
01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.480
easier for you because you don't have
i'm replacing them yeah you're much

1177
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.400
better replacing those things than i am
whereas attack on titan is my obsession

1178
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.280
now that's where i'm watching the theory
videos and everything even though i know

1179
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.120
how it ends i very much like um
i develop my life around a series of

1180
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.719
habits and patterns yeah and so it's
really hard to start new habits and it's

1181
01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:19.199
really hard to break them yeah um so
like i'm working to kind of find

1182
01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:23.600
something new to kind of focus on i
don't know i'm accruing a lot of monkey

1183
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.120
kid lego so maybe that'll be it
yeah like i've actually been thinking

1184
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:33.840
about like checking out naruto or naruto
um some other anime that are i've heard

1185
01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.600
very conflicting things about naruto
yeah um

1186
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.960
uh one punch
like i've been thinking about a bunch of

1187
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.600
different stuff checking out a bunch of
different stuff that i'll probably do

1188
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.199
while you're gone
um

1189
01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:52.080
but yeah it's sad that these formative
pieces of media

1190
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.760
like star wars and marvel
are

1191
01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.400
becoming
so corporatized yeah especially insanity

1192
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.320
star wars especially which was meant to
be neither yeah like i for instance i

1193
01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.000
don't think you would have
i don't think disney would release

1194
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.440
episode three
god no

1195
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.400
like like i was kind of postulating to
you like can you imagine the look on

1196
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.719
carrie's face when she read george lucas
actually killing the kids like wow like

1197
01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:24.800
like yeah like killing the younglings
even like having anakin be like

1198
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.040
cut

1199
01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.679
choking a pregnant lady of course joking
you're pregnant well yeah but like

1200
01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:36.239
the hero
obi-wan cutting apart the villain yeah

1201
01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:38.400
like i don't think they would have done
that

1202
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.520
and i don't think they will do that um
so you know star wars kind of star wars

1203
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.920
was never edgy but it kind of lo what
edge it had it has lost i think yeah it

1204
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.440
was it wasn't afraid because they
weren't even they weren't even brave

1205
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.719
enough to just let kylo ren be a space
fascist yes they had to save him yeah

1206
01:18:56.719 --> 01:19:00.320
and they had to even though that at the
end of episode eight it was made clear

1207
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.440
that rey is no not romantically
interested in this guy they had to

1208
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.280
reopen that door to make him redeemable
yeah

1209
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:13.120
but so that's our episode on
stuff that we liked and we don't like

1210
01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.719
anymore
but once gave us joy how disney

1211
01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:19.760
destroyed our childhood
um

1212
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.719
so thank you guys for listening
um the next episode will be about

1213
01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.360
something i'm not sure what it will be
about but it will be about something it

1214
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.400
will be another pre-recorded one so
again if we say anything about anyone

1215
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.400
who has accidentally died um we
apologize in advance

1216
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.360
um
so

1217
