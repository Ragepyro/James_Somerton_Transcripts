this video is brought to you by
Squarespace hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.440
to gays Behaving Badly the podcast
YouTube show that Neil Patrick Harris

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.960
will absolutely never come on my name is
James

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
you okay over there hi I'm Nick I'm I'm
Nick that's Nick

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.520
um
yeah welcome to the show

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.880
um today we are talking about what are
we talking about today today we are

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.199
talking about the gay glass ceiling and
the pressure that a lot of queer

8
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.640
creators are under to produce excellent
media will continue to being invisible

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.480
while continuing to be invisible
um which is it's something that's been

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.660
coming closer and closer to mind for me
um because you know I'm seeing a lot of

11
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.860
uh a lot of shows coming out that have
queer creators like like Heart Stopper

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.820
for instance Alice oseman is an
executive producer on that as well as

13
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.239
the author of The the books on which
it's based

14
00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.260
um and I'm seeing like a lot of queer
creators getting one really big hit but

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.420
basically being ignored like they're not
being kind of like head hunted as like

16
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.560
oh we want you to do a show for us next
and there's really only like a couple

17
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.060
that get that treatment whereas you find
you know straight white show runners or

18
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.119
straight white writers in Hollywood who
just get handed million dollar gig after

19
00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.479
million dollar gig and this is something
that has been kind of on my mind for

20
00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.960
some time ever since especially since
before I published my book gentlemen's

21
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.299
club available on Amazon and it and and
at nthurgot.com

22
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.880
um so uh like I've kind of really felt
that crunch too like you know how much

23
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.899
more meticulous I need to be about the
media that I create which has actually

24
00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.460
affected the media that I output yeah I
just don't put out as much because I I

25
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.040
I'm so terrified that it's not up to a
standard that is going to uh need to be

26
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.640
what it needs to be in order to be
noticed we are going to talk about that

27
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.819
today and how that how and our
observation with how we're looking at

28
00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.040
that in the culture yeah
okay so is that the is that is that the

29
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.720
introduction is that
um segment one uh like and we do want to

30
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
specify that naturally We There are
queer we're not saying that there aren't

31
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.080
any queer creators out there or is that
there aren't any Stellar queer creators

32
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.599
we're outlining that they're in spite of
some very talented creators in all

33
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.160
Fields queer people
um there there's this kind of uh what's

34
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.060
the metaphor I can use like an iron
curtain like something like that like a

35
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.160
lavender curtain the lavender curtain uh
title for the video

36
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.800
um it's like even if they're popular and
even in queer spaces like these these

37
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.400
people are kind of held up for like kind
of a one once and done yeah because like

38
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.879
I was I actually looked up a list
earlier today

39
00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.519
um basically it was like the 50 most
influential gays in Hollywood and other

40
00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.760
than six of them and I wrote the six of
them down and we're actually going to

41
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.940
talk about them in this video
um

42
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.040
most of them are basically just actors
who produce stuff for themselves to be

43
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.200
in because they're not being cast
because they're out yeah and so it's

44
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.800
like okay if 40 of them on the list are
just actors who are trying to make sure

45
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.800
that they have jobs yeah how are they
actually powerful and how do how does

46
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.360
that compare to the power of like the
one or two that we'll get into who

47
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.580
actually have pull in Hollywood yeah and
yeah and just like how what they have to

48
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.319
be to get that pull yeah
um and like like I said like how why is

49
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.120
it that you know a straight white
screenwriter can get you know million

50
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.799
dollar job after million dollar job
writing these gigantic movies that may

51
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.340
or may not make any money and they
constantly get forgiven if they're

52
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.879
complete bombs but if a great Creator
makes something like you know I'm not a

53
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.900
fan of bros but Billy Eichner for
instance you know is Billy Eichner gonna

54
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.920
get given another 30 million dollar
movie going on and like just touching on

55
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.340
that like we give them a hard time
however one of the arguments I saw

56
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.180
around the time of the movie being
realized oh this is a flop

57
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.500
um was the discussion like okay gay
people straight people get their bad

58
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.180
rom-coms all the time yeah it's fair
that we have one or two also

59
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.840
um yeah so like there are some straight
rom-coms that are a hell of a lot worse

60
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.199
than Bros and I don't think we've ever
said Billy arkner should just not get

61
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.540
work because like we said like there are
straight creators who continue like

62
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.080
they're they're constantly on the grind
oh yeah um it takes a if you get that if

63
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.199
you're a straight crater and you get
that straight man specifically a

64
00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.479
straight white man and you get that one
good movie The amount of free passes you

65
00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.160
get Matthew McConaughey has made some
horrible movies and he still gets

66
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.220
gigantic paychecks yeah and like quite
frankly I think that you know even

67
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.960
though he has an Oscar I find that his
Oscar acting is very interchangeable I

68
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.759
think most of his acting
you know no Tino shade but yeah yeah

69
00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.780
Matthew McConaughey is very good at one
thing yeah and that said like it's it's

70
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.139
not like we're saying these people
should not Nicholas Cage another good

71
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.639
example so yeah we're going to get into
the actual meat of the video now but

72
00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.940
before we do that we're going to have a

93
00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.020
want to talk about is like who qualifies
as a successful Creator

94
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.620
um in the world uh and this is kind of
where the list comes in like we wanted

95
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.220
to talk about that like yeah so I have a
list of six people here who are well

96
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.500
seven people six entries yes sorry about
that seven people six entries among the

97
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.000
gays he's considered very successful
because for a gay producer in Hollywood

98
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.500
he is very successful and that's Greg
berlante uh if you don't know who Greg

99
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.500
berlanti is he is the Mind behind all of
the cwdc stuff the arrowverse

100
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.979
um the flash all of that as well as
Riverdale and the movie love Simon and

101
00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:39.599
so he is as far as the CW goes he is
King of the CW like he's like the Kevin

102
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:47.160
foggy of the CW yeah like he has control
over that with an iron grip and you know

103
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.300
it helps that it's the shows are really
popular like you can argue the quality

104
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.199
of them but most of them are really
popular so he knows how to hit the pulse

105
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.979
yeah which is a rare Talent actually
like it's a very rare Talent like

106
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:04.860
whether you're making art media or pop
media knowing how to not Pander but just

107
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.639
service your audience is something that
is

108
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:13.020
that's one of the rarest artistic skills
you have that are out there yeah and he

109
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.020
has dozens of shows going at any given
time like it's not just like oh he works

110
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.539
on Arrow and then next year he works on
the flash he has dozens of shows going

111
00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:32.099
uh all at once on the CW and movies and
like he's a very very busy fella and I

112
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:36.419
would be curious let me know in the
comments below did you know he existed

113
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:41.279
before that like I I've heard before
before like us letting you know I have

114
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:46.320
heard of him I've heard him talked about
because like I I'm me probably mostly

115
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.180
like we were roommates for a very long
time I heard bleed over from your living

116
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.959
space
um for podcasts and YouTube and stuff

117
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.180
and you kind of come over and talk to me
like hey you want to hear what happened

118
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.899
today in Hollywood yeah
um and the answer was always generally

119
00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:05.779
yes because that drama like lots of
drama uh the drama is like electric

120
00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.360
electrolytes for the gays
um so the next one that I I have listed

121
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.459
here is Russell T Davies who a lot of
nerds will obviously know of because he

122
00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:18.839
is the showrunner for Doctor Who
Um he is the one who brought Doctor Who

123
00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:24.839
back from a long Hiatus it stopped in
the 80s I think and he brought it back

124
00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:30.480
um in 2005. starting with the ninth for
the movie and then the Ninth Doctor

125
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.019
yeah and then it was the Ninth Doctor
Who the War Doctor was the movie I think

126
00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:38.100
and then uhuvian's in the in chat in
comments will correct me yeah I I

127
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.620
haven't watched Good Doctor Who before
but I'm going to check out the new

128
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.660
season
um and it's been staggering like

129
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.100
successful since he hugely successful
huge and he also created Queer as Folk

130
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.380
and he has done any number of British
person right and and a executive

131
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.660
produced the American version too okay
um and he's done any number of queer

132
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.860
related shows in England it's a sin
probably being the most

133
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:09.180
um revered of them but you know talk to
someone outside of queer or nerd spaces

134
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.980
they don't know who the hell Russell T
Davies is yeah another one is Cindy

135
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.300
Holland who's an executive at Netflix
she is the executive that made Orange is

136
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.220
the New Black Hat this is a name I have
not heard yeah I didn't hear it either

137
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.519
she made sex education happen which is
another huge hit or just the New Black

138
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:29.580
I've never even heard of her before
Orange is the New Black is basically

139
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.700
what put Netflix on the map like Netflix
Netflix creative products Orange is the

140
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.060
New Black and house of cards came out
like very similar but I think I heard

141
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.240
about Orange is the New Black before
House of Cards

142
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.500
um and people just died for that like
yeah Orange is the New Black is one of

143
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.100
those rare Netflix shows that lasted for
like seven or eight seasons yeah yeah

144
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.440
and then we have the Wachowski sisters
who have done a lot of stuff you know

145
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.579
sense8 is the most popular among the
queer audience but Sensei never found an

146
00:10:56.579 --> 00:11:02.760
audience big enough to justify it being
renewed for a full third season

147
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.839
um
and really although they are known by

148
00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:10.800
the the wider audience they're really
only known for the Matrix even though

149
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.339
they have done other stuff they've done
Cloud Atlas they've done Speed Racers

150
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:19.260
everybody rips apart Speed Racer it's a
fun movie it also just looks gorgeous oh

151
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.660
it's an amazing movie like if they could
re-release Speed Racer and HDR in 3D I'd

152
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.920
go see that uh you did Jupiter Ascending
they did one other one they were

153
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.220
director they were producers on V for
Vendetta yeah they produced V for

154
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.760
Vendetta uh which you know I definitely
got a lot SM Wachowski feels off of that

155
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.880
and the thing about the wachowskis is I
don't think they're bad directors I

156
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.959
think they're quite good as directors
um it's just for some reason their

157
00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:48.240
movies aren't don't do and the thing is
like when you watch the wachowski's

158
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.660
movies
none of them are any weirder than the

159
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.019
Matrix yeah it's just for some reason
the Matrix

160
00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:59.760
happened at just the right moment I also
think like Cloud Atlas is no weirder

161
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.420
than the Matrix but it was considered a
much more like artsy movie I actually

162
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.500
really like Cloud Atlas I I read the
book I thought the book is phenomenal I

163
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.860
let I heard that the book uh was more
sequential it had more of a structure

164
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.000
whereas in the the movie was more
parallel I should watch the movie to

165
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.540
kind of compare it to the book it has
your guy in there the one the gay actor

166
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.940
you really like he was cute oh oh Ben
winshaw yeah he actually played a gay

167
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.200
character but uh next person on the list
uh yeah the next person on the list is

168
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:34.320
Victoria Alonso who was Kevin feige's
number two at Marvel Studios for since

169
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.000
the beginning of Marvel Studios yes and
she was an incredibly powerful gay woman

170
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.820
of color like she was a force to be
reckoned with in Hollywood yeah and she

171
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:53.100
just got fired and the excuse is that
she was uh the basically uh it was that

172
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.100
she was in control of the special
effects and and the special effects have

173
00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.180
been suffering and it's all her fault
and so she got fired she was basically

174
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.040
the scapegoat for the Marvel movies
having not done well recently but they

175
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.820
didn't but people don't seem to take
into account that she was also in charge

176
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.260
of the special effects for end game and
uh Captain America the Winter Soldier

177
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.620
specifically yeah and like all of that
the one that she should get credit for

178
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.480
is
um

179
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.700
Thanos yeah the the first endgame movie
Infinity War yeah because Thanos was

180
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.440
that that was schmiegel quality

181
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.079
um just for how you you saw pores on his
face yeah like it was it was

182
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:37.620
phenomenally well done and like she's
not a visual effects artist but she is a

183
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.399
she was the producer in charge of that
and she obviously had many more roles

184
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:45.600
within the MCU
um but Disney fired her she was the

185
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.980
scapegoat for basically why Marvel
movies aren't doing well right now and

186
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.959
you know she she got the blame for it
and a lot of people were like oh she's

187
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:59.639
she's she's mean but now a lot of people
are coming around and kind of seeing

188
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:04.740
wait a minute
yeah because if you fired Kevin feige

189
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.660
because [ __ ] was messing up then you
know then everyone sees oh we have a

190
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.440
problem here but if you fire Victoria
Alonso who most people don't know who

191
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.579
she is then it makes it seem like you're
correcting something you're correcting a

192
00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:23.839
mistake that's that isn't like that big
of a mistake yeah and okay

193
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:28.500
yeah yeah and so
apparently she was also very vocal about

194
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.680
Disney's silence on the downstairs
and it is very vocal about them erasing

195
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.120
gay characters and uh even like Pride
Flags out of Marvel movies and it has

196
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.480
come out that she that that's actually a
component for why they wanted to get rid

197
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.899
of her because she was very quote
annoying yeah so this is all just to

198
00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:51.120
sort of highlight the kind of
positions of authority that queer

199
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.839
creatives need to have to be recognized
even on a yeah like subdermal level the

200
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:04.740
second in command of the MCU
even at that phase of your career you're

201
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.420
Expendable yeah you yeah
and that's the thing like we look at

202
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.540
um Victoria Alonso Ryan Murphy
specifically is the biggest yeah I was

203
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.459
leaving Ryan Murphy for last because
Ryan Murphy is the the the the the the

204
00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:22.380
outlier for all of these like Greg
brilanti is very well known you know

205
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.060
because as within geek circles and some
gay circles because he is a gay

206
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:33.240
executive basically running the DC
Universe at CW at the CW but Ryan Murphy

207
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.260
you know he got a billion dollar deal
with Netflix and they have already made

208
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.060
that money back because of Dahmer but
like you look at Ryan Murphy's work and

209
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:48.540
you have Glee American Horror Story
American Crime Story pose

210
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.600
um

211
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.779
and some of his shows flop horrendously
and he does get the sort of

212
00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.920
um the golden teeth the oopsie Daisy you
can come back and try again but like

213
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.480
it's the fact that like for the number
of whites for the we'll just say

214
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.959
privilege for the number of privileged
producers and creatives who get that

215
00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:13.139
golden parachute who get the oopsie
Daisy card yeah

216
00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.260
um

217
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.399
and Greg berlenty like he hasn't kind of
made anything really particularly

218
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.820
floppish
um I mean there's been stuff in the DC

219
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.139
the the CW stuff that like Batgirl or
Batwoman I think it's just the fact that

220
00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:30.959
you know what he what does succeed
succeed so hard that they're afraid to

221
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:36.300
get rid of him because like when he hits
he hits well yeah like okay yeah he you

222
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.740
know messed up and you know Batwoman
wasn't a huge success but then there's

223
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.420
Riverdale yeah then there's Riverdale
and Riverdale prints money for them

224
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.420
um and you know the flash was printing
money for them I think the flash is over

225
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.660
now but
um era was for the first half of it

226
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.920
printed money yeah a lot of the fandom
apparently fell off and so you know

227
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.779
that's that's
why he was given love Simon because he

228
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:05.760
they were like yeah you're a TV guy but
we'll let you do this because your your

229
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.819
TV stuff is so successful a very
different Beast than Ryan Murphy whereas

230
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.059
Ryan Murphy kind of used Glee and kind
of to springboard himself into much more

231
00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:15.540
prestigious media like well that's
that's Ryan Murphy kind of worked on a

232
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.220
lot of stuff Ryan Murphy really kind of
Hit the scene with nip talk yeah

233
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.799
um which kind of that's where producers
found out who he was yeah and then he

234
00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:31.020
paired up with Brad falchuk to make uh
Glee and then Glee took off into the

235
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.020
stratosphere well that's what I mean
like basically flea was kind of very TV

236
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.559
it was very pop and like he kind of used
that to make American Horror Story and

237
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:41.760
the other things which did have a much
more level of prestige whereas Greg Burr

238
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.980
uh yeah like American Horror Story was
like oh you want to win an Emmy like go

239
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.160
to American Horse whereas Greg brilliant
he's much more pop he's much more fluff

240
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.220
and that's not saying derogatory no it's
not saying like you know he's good at

241
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.780
what he does like I gave him a glowing
compliment earlier like but um so

242
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.340
there's these two kind of uh homos and
Hollywood homos

243
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.200
um and like
there are so many other creative queer

244
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.640
people in Hollywood like why is it just
kind of coalesce around them and uh and

245
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.860
Billy Porter that's another one I want
to talk about when we're talking about

246
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.100
like queers that are struggling like
yeah like Billy Porter is someone who

247
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.580
even the Straits know who Billy Porter
is like Billy Porter shows up at every

248
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.080
red carpet and is fabulous beyond belief
yeah so even the Straits know who he is

249
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.460
like he said in interviews he can't get
cast as straight characters but he also

250
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.480
kick a cast as gay character and like
that's really interesting to me because

251
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:39.059
it kind of feeds into my idea that
um Hollywood sees queerness as a role it

252
00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:42.480
sees it as an act and if you are queer
then you're not acting yeah the thing

253
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.600
that I've noticed quite a bit is that
Hollywood isn't totally against pushing

254
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.460
gay actors but they do seem to have a
problem with gay actors of color yeah uh

255
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.140
like Billy Porter for instance and you
know like the cast of Fire Island Fire

256
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.340
Island was supposed to be a theatrical
release and then it got shunted over to

257
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.400
Hulu and I think if that had been a
movie starring a bunch of white gay

258
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.240
actors yeah I part of me thinks it
wouldn't have gotten shunted over to

259
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.840
Hulu I will also and it was also much
better than Bros and it should have gone

260
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.000
to theaters because it would have made
money and then we would have had a gay

261
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.240
success story thank you I also would
like to elaborate on that and say I

262
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:27.059
don't think that Hollywood has much of a
memory or ability to remember more than

263
00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:32.100
one or two gay actors whatsoever and
that includes lesbians

264
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.799
um so it's kind of one for him one for
her

265
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.620
um and everyone else can kind of just
find their own kind of like Niche

266
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.760
project projects and you know queer
Independent films and

267
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.580
um but it's definitely a
job being a judge on drag race

268
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.480
you know Hollywood you know is pressured
to put diversity in their movies so they

269
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.039
find one or two
uh uh actors of these diverse categories

270
00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:59.700
they're willing to play by the rules and
everyone else is like okay we filled our

271
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.559
spot yeah we filled our position yeah
and it's less it's not as dire when it

272
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:07.620
comes to writers and directors yeah
because you know they're behind the

273
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.039
camera their personal lives aren't kind
of scrutinized the way they act they're

274
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:14.280
not the stars or the cameras aren't
pointed to that thing exactly

275
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.080
um but then at the same time name a gay
director that is a Spielberg or a

276
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.840
Tarantino yeah or a Scorsese or uh
Christopher Nolan or like name a gay

277
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.539
director who is in that League I feel
like even though it is easier to sort of

278
00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:34.799
get by and there are plenty of gay
directors who are very successful none

279
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:40.320
of them have reached that kind of high
iconic Echelon iconic is a good way to

280
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.179
put it yeah and what this is a bit of a
difficult thing for and this is where

281
00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:48.179
it's kind of factoring into where it's
on your mind because you are starting to

282
00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:51.720
trying to get into directing you do want
to reach that level of prestige in terms

283
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.340
of your visuals and you know putting
together a story yeah like I would like

284
00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.960
like I don't ever expect any movies I
make to be like considered in the league

285
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.220
with you know Steven Spielberg or Martin
Scorsese or anything like that but I

286
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.140
would like to be able to make movies
that look like they could

287
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.760
um and the the thing that worries me
there

288
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.140
is
there is not really

289
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:25.559
a gay template for the gay director to
follow whereas you know you do have the

290
00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:30.600
Scorsese the spielbergs the Christopher
Nolans the the tarantinos

291
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.539
um
that you can kind of look at and be like

292
00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:37.620
or even either there are even a handful
of women uh directors you can if you're

293
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.380
a young lady kind of going into film
you'll be like I can do I can do it

294
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.700
because she can because she's yeah like
I could I could try and be Chloe Zhao or

295
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.539
Catherine Bigelow or if you're like a
creator of color there's Ava Duvernay

296
00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:53.460
there's um yeah Ryan coogler there's
Jordan peel uh but even then there's

297
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.720
less of those than there are straight
white men absolutely but I think there's

298
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.240
I I think people like
um Jordan peel and Ryan coogler are far

299
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.820
more household names than name any gay
director and with that let's move to our

300
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.799
next segment
now the break is over because some of

301
00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.440
you are watching on patreon or your
YouTube members and you don't have to

302
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.299
watch ads so what's the what's our next
segment next uh our next segment is our

303
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:24.059
personal experience with this and how
this how we're staring there in the

304
00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:28.980
barrel of this uh the lavender curtain
uh yeah I am calling it that now I I

305
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.080
dubbed it um on the record claiming it I
I think I think I

306
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.679
I think I have much less anxiety about
it than you do so I'll if you don't mind

307
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:41.640
I'll kind of get my
piece out of the way

308
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.140
um because like I said at the end of the
last segment I do want to be able to

309
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:52.020
make movies that are considered good
that aren't just gay movies like good

310
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.380
for a gay movie kind of thing that's
something I wanted to talk about earlier

311
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.620
kind of just the idea that you know like
when it comes to queer creators there's

312
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.039
that element of we need to be the best
or we're just gonna be good with the

313
00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:06.360
asterisks of for a queer Creator yeah we
have to if we're not Ryan Murphy we're

314
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.860
nothing yes
um and because I like I said before I

315
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.320
can't think of a gay director that has
reached that kind of top-tier echelon

316
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.480
not for some not for some time and you
know there are amazing gay directors out

317
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.480
there right now who are doing amazing
movies but they are

318
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.440
like they're not
consider they're not spoken of in the

319
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:38.760
same words as even B tier straight white
dudes yeah yeah like uh I can never

320
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.360
pronounce his name I can never pronounce
his name so I'm not going to because I'm

321
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.500
just going to offend people
um but he's uh directing a short film

322
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:54.240
about uh gay cowboys with
um yeah he's a movie about gay cowboys

323
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.720
with Pedro Pascal
yeah people in gay media are talking

324
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.700
about it nobody else is and he is I
think one of the best directors of his

325
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.240
generation Pedro Ahmad davar oh I can't
say his last name I'm so sorry but he's

326
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.460
not even spoken of in this with the same
reverence as JJ Abrams yeah but when I

327
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.020
go to like a serviceable mid-tier
director I always go to guy Richie Guy

328
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.380
Ritchie yeah just because I like he's
done some good movies

329
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.760
I guess so but earlier in his career
like some of his movies were like

330
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.840
actually legitimately good okay but I
like it's been a while

331
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.980
was
um uh Aladdin right the live action yeah

332
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.260
um like that just so mid especially when
there were so many opportunities

333
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.640
inviting a directory live action remake
yeah like there are invitations to be

334
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.940
cartoonish in the in these sections
because they're based on cartoons yeah

335
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.220
but like like you said there isn't any
kind of road map for how to get that

336
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:58.200
sort of top tier like uh prestigious
like yeah like what kind of movie do you

337
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.539
need to make to be considered in that
same tier yeah because there are gay

338
00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:09.240
directors who do make movies that are
just as good and just as good as far as

339
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.220
like production quality and everything
as Martin scorsese's early movies as

340
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.840
Spielberg's early movies yeah the
difference is that even though someone

341
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.419
is making movies just as good as Raging
Bull or just as good as Mean Streets

342
00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:27.900
they're not being given the money to do
Goodfellas they're not being the money

343
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.940
to do the The Departed they're not
getting the money to do Jurassic Park or

344
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.240
you know
Schindler's List or something that

345
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.020
opportunity to you know
rise to the challenge

346
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.700
when it comes to uh writing books like
of being being an author like there is a

347
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.419
little it is what you are yeah it's a
little bit of a different beast and even

348
00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:52.020
like uh with me kind of branching into
writing screenplays like that's also a

349
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.360
bit of a different piece where there are
kind of

350
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.080
um uh gorvadol uh very famous
screenwriter

351
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.200
um

352
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.500
uh maybe yes he wrote Ben Hur maybe he
didn't write Spartacus he did write Ben

353
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.919
Hur and if you watch Ben Hur there's a
lot of clear coding in Ben Hur and he

354
00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:17.520
put that in there on purpose to bug
Charlton Heston uh so um fabulous Queen

355
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.799
um oh just and a great novelist too one
of the greatest

356
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:27.480
um uh orators
I was going to say just greatest uh like

357
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.360
deathlines of all time was the best
thing that ever happened to Truman

358
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.320
capote's career was his death or dying
was the best thing that ever happened to

359
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.400
Truman capote's career um I wish when
you could be like before Joan Crawford

360
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.940
is dead
good my mother said that when someone

361
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.799
dies you should never say anything bad
only good Joan Crawford is dead good

362
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:51.799
that's what Betty Davis said when she
found out Joan Crawford had died

363
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.880
uh
um you're not allowed to be [ __ ] like

364
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.620
that anymore no it's heartbreaking
only drag queens are allowed to be that

365
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.860
[ __ ] now
um and only on YouTube so yeah like it's

366
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.539
daunting for me because there are
phenomenal queer our uh authors out

367
00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:16.740
there uh what quarrels like of all
genders and all sexuality do I say no I

368
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.320
was just I was making fun of people who
do

369
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.700
but like
um and this I think this is a problem

370
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.679
with the publishing industry uh gay men
kind of get swept under the rug

371
00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:35.640
um yeah like there's a shelf over here
that is filled with books by that are

372
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:42.000
just it's like half of the wall is books
about gay people

373
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.260
um the books that you have heard of are
written by women yeah uh women straight

374
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.100
women get bisexual women gay women but
they're written by women other than Adam

375
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:56.580
Silvera I can't really think of any gay
male author who writes gay male

376
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:02.340
Centric books where their publisher
really pushed them and with even with

377
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.059
Adam I think I think a lot of that was
Tick Tock like I think like it wasn't so

378
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:09.240
much the publisher pushing it as
Tick-Tock so like yeah again like I

379
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.220
mentioned part of the thing like I I
because I want to kind of I naturally as

380
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.480
someone have Ambitions of kind of
imagine having Ambitions you know being

381
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.960
the greatest ever
um whether I will or will is another

382
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.860
question but like because I feel like I
have this curtain I have to cross the

383
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:31.919
lavender curtain yeah uh my coin term my
term coined uh didn't I say lavender

384
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.620
curtain but no what are you talking
about

385
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.520
changing history

386
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:45.360
that's the lavender curtain
changing history they were roommates so

387
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.679
um because I have that Crossing like I
hold myself to such an immeasurably high

388
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:54.419
standard of kind of like making sure
that the media I create is like the best

389
00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:57.960
it can possibly be and it's crippling
and because of that I've had to really

390
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.820
begin I really psychologically
reassessed what my career should be

391
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.419
um so I'm now kind of like moving away
from like being like high selling to I

392
00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:09.539
want to have books that are being
remembered yeah which means I need to

393
00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:12.179
put more thought into them which means I
can't write them as fast which means I

394
00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:15.659
can't put them put them out as much yeah
so like and that's kind of that's the

395
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:20.580
publishing model these days is volume
especially with self-published authors

396
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.899
it's like you the the the the
expectation is you're going to put like

397
00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:30.360
three or four books out a year minimum
um instead of you know traditionally

398
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.299
published authors or Chad published
authors

399
00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:36.240
um who you know every two or three years
the book comes out or if you're someone

400
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.559
like George R Martin
maybe once a decade me having this

401
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:44.159
channel is probably better than the
overwhelming majority of a lot of other

402
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:48.120
queer authors out even traditionally
published authors yeah uh so I'm really

403
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.840
grateful for that and I'm hoping that I
can continue to use that as like a

404
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.600
platform and that's something me asking
that's me telling

405
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.740
um that's the condition for my
employment

406
00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.919
um the question that comes back too and
it's about like especially because we

407
00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.740
meant I want to reiterate that this
isn't something that's unique to queer

408
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.740
people no
um and I mentioned David Duvernay before

409
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.700
like she had Wrinkle in Time that was a
flop why hasn't she worked again since

410
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.779
yeah and she has not been given a movie
since yeah like she's whereas this is

411
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:20.700
It's a Salma was like a phenomenally
well-regarded movie like she should have

412
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.240
gotten a free pass from that she should
have been she's gotten the best director

413
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.640
Oscar nomination for that but like yeah
she did Wrinkle in Time did not do well

414
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.260
at all and basically has been
blacklisted yeah and um and it's but

415
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.840
it's an open joke right now at Marvel
among people who cover my Marvel that

416
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.899
the people writing Marvel movies right
now

417
00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:47.760
keep getting rehired even though
universally it's agreed that phase four

418
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.240
has been a written [ __ ] show which is
unfortunate because you know like there

419
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.559
there must be more Talent well I mean
there's also

420
00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:00.179
um uh oh I just was just talking about
it Jordan there's also Jordan Peele who

421
00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:04.440
a lot of people but Jordan Peele has
said and here's here's a thing that a

422
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.679
lot of Hollywood doesn't like about
Jordan Peele they've asked him when are

423
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:12.720
you going to make a white movie and he
said I'm not I believe Toni Morrison got

424
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.620
asked the same question and by Barbara
Walters I think

425
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.620
um

426
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.840
average

427
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.640
um I was asked like when are you going
to write a white book and she said like

428
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.659
the question is inherently racist
because like I'm writing books yeah like

429
00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:37.020
there's no white book there's no black
book I'm writing books that speak to my

430
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.500
experiences and books that I think that
we need in the world yeah

431
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.460
um Jordan peeler said he's not going to
make a white movie yeah um even though

432
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.620
he's including White characters uh like
in um in nope I loved that character the

433
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.919
the
the editor oh yeah yeah I can't remember

434
00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:57.059
his name but he just showed up the skirt
he showed up to film jean jacket in a

435
00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:01.380
skirt and nobody had questions like
that's Hollywood

436
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.860
um I just love that movie so I love both
of his I've only seen you haven't seen

437
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.899
us because yeah you're scared I have
been told that it's scarier

438
00:32:08.899 --> 00:32:14.220
it's not I didn't find us scary but it's
like one of those kind of like

439
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.520
make you think he movies I didn't find
nope to be like that kind of long-term

440
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.640
scary no
um I mean some of the visuals still are

441
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.840
staying staying with me like just the
inside jean jacket uh people being eaten

442
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.360
yeah
um then it's just the crunch yeah but um

443
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.539
again like that there's that idea like
he makes things that stick in your head

444
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:39.480
that aren't necessarily scary when
you're watching but it's just like I

445
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.620
can't get this out now yeah uh just
ideas like I I just loved

446
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.460
um get out so much yeah I love both of
the ones that I've seen and it's amazing

447
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.539
we deserve that Oscar
like that that was phenomenally written

448
00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:55.620
yeah um it makes me want to see us but I
am a scaredy cat so

449
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.880
there's a thing that's kind of Bot and
maybe he got offered it maybe he didn't

450
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:06.260
but why was he not direct why is he not
directing blade

451
00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:10.200
oh he'd be really good for that I think
maybe it's because

452
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.200
um he is fairly artistic and Marvel oh
no no not an artistic Marvel doesn't

453
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.960
seem to like that especially after
Chloe's out well yeah they were very

454
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.620
excited about Chloe Zhao and then she
made an artistic movie and they realized

455
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.240
oh artistic movies aren't mainstream
movies oh damn it who's who's um guy who

456
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.200
makes me doing media movies Tyler Perry
Tyler Perry like he you know he's

457
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.260
another one like Ryan coogler who's kind
of really broke he had to make his own

458
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.659
yeah but here's the thing with Tyler
Perry is that Hollywood considers him a

459
00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:43.860
joke yes but he has basically created
his own Hollywood yeah and that's the

460
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.740
thing why do you have built his own
stuff that's what you kind of have to be

461
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.299
in order to succeed as a Creator outside
the hegemony yeah and that's what we're

462
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:54.539
going to be trying to do with Telos
pictures like we're going to try and

463
00:33:54.539 --> 00:34:00.539
create you know the gay version of what
Tyler Perry has done yeah so like and

464
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:05.659
that's kind of my solution to uh James's
Quinn term lavender curtain

465
00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:11.099
is like you know like bias for us like
you know if they're gonna keep you out

466
00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:15.859
make your own moon landing base with
Blackjack and hookers

467
00:34:15.859 --> 00:34:21.300
make them like make them sad like
it like the BL industry in Asia like

468
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.720
Hollywood wishes they could like well
that's the thing like and that's going

469
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.619
to be a video that we get into but like
the BL industry is you know it's mostly

470
00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:36.780
written by women but it is an industry
an industry that is about pretty boys

471
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:43.740
kissing each other and
it is hugely popular even like in China

472
00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.540
where it's like the the Chinese
communist government is so homophone

473
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.839
they've started to buckle because it's
just they haven't started to buckle but

474
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:57.060
they've started they they they let some
you know there's Coatings that's what I

475
00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.099
said started to buckle on it yeah and
like in Korea and Taiwan and Thailand

476
00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:09.800
Japan BL is hugely popular yeah and
makes a fortune and Hollywood is like

477
00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:18.599
it's like the comic books industry
ignoring the fact that manga has been

478
00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:22.680
outselling American comic books for the
last decade not just I was telling but

479
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.359
take any one like successful manga it's
outselling every Marvel's profits yeah

480
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.359
like Marvel Comics prophets DC Comics
because you know if you start reading a

481
00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:33.660
comic book it might get canceled in four
issues but if you start reading a manga

482
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.280
you're probably gonna have you're set
like volumes upon volume you're probably

483
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.339
going to get at least like eight volumes
into that

484
00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:45.599
um so like and that's the solution is
kind of when you you feel like like I

485
00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:48.599
like I feel like I don't really have a
road map to the kind of success I want

486
00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:51.420
to reach yeah
um you don't really have a roadmap for

487
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.119
the kind of success you want no like
with Telos I'm kind of like there are

488
00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:59.220
gay movies Studios out there that do do
like gay movies

489
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.619
um
but you know they are they're they're

490
00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:05.280
higher budget than what Telos has to
work with unfortunately but

491
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.700
um
they feel

492
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.859
they don't I don't want to say they feel
cheap they feel low budget yeah and my

493
00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:20.400
hope is to be able to make movies that
look like

494
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.800
they weren't shot looked like they took
six months to shoot yeah instead of you

495
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.060
know shot in three weeks yeah and that's
the hope and trying to you know Elevate

496
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.640
things not that there's anything wrong
with what we have but also kind of just

497
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.800
break that the glass ceiling yeah
um and so that's kind of my optimistic

498
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.520
ending to that
yeah and and hopefully there is you know

499
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.520
optimism out there that you know there
although the Our Generation and the

500
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.680
generation coming up and everything we
don't really have the the the the

501
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.440
um the road map set out like a lot of
CIS hat people do yeah but maybe we'll

502
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.980
not necessarily us but hopefully us but
you know people of our generation will

503
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.060
make that road map yeah like in place
the Trailblazers basically yeah and it's

504
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.480
I mean like there's a lot of I find
people a privilege would put a lot of

505
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.200
pressure in me like oh I want to be a
Trailblazer disrupter it's hard it is

506
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.619
hard work to kind of think of yourself
as like oh I'm kind of doing something

507
00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:20.160
that you know I don't really have a
guide for yeah

508
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.099
um and honestly I would rather not be a
Trailblazer I would rather just make

509
00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:29.960
good [ __ ] art like yeah
