00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
this video is brought to you by Atlas
VPN I've been noticing something over

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
the last few months
years that's been bothering me but I

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
haven't spoken that much about it I
wonder if you my dear viewers have

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
noticed the same thing that being the
complete and utter neglect for the

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.320
privacy of queer people first let's talk
about celebrities while many people feel

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.160
like celebrities give up their right to
privacy when they become an actor or

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
singer or public figure in general
that's not actually how the world works

8
00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.860
you don't give up your right to privacy
when you become a teacher or a lawyer of

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.059
course the most prominent recent example
of this is kit Connor who was forced out

10
00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
of the closet this past year when an
internet mob essentially accused him of

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
queerbaiting real people can't queer
bait by the way by playing a queer

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
character in multiple pieces of media
while not actively being out as queer

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
himself it got even worse for him when
horror of Horrors he was spotted holding

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
a girl's hand so to Tamp down on the
rising tide of the internet boundary

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460
pushing he came out as bisexual some
have since accused him of being a fake

16
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
bisexual and refused to believe him
until he has a boyfriend

17
00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
to them I say
stop but he's far from the only

18
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.820
celebrity to be pushed Out of the Closet
in 1996 Nathan Lane appeared on Oprah to

19
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
promote the birdcage prior to the taping
he specifically said he didn't want to

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.280
talk about his sexuality but when they
went live Oprah began pushing for

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.759
answers anyway Lance Bass was forced to
make a public statement about his

22
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
sexuality in 2006 after Perez Hilton
nicknamed him princess Frosty locks and

23
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.840
wouldn't stop posting blog entries about
how obviously gay he was Perez Hilton

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.680
also instigated a similar campaign
against Neil Patrick Harris the same

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.460
year and it's only gotten worse since
social media became a factor rumors

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.240
swirled around online about actresses
such as Rebel Wilson and Kristen Stewart

27
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.799
eventually leading to them coming out
under threats from tabloid sites it's

28
00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.820
not like the old days when gay rumors
would start up in a Hollywood studio or

29
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
a record label would have a star paired
up with a similarly famous celebrity to

30
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.700
hide their sexuality though many fans
still think this does happen with people

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles
Studios and labels have much less

32
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.860
control over stars now though they do
continue to influence many people to

33
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.959
stay in the closet I personally know of
at least three Hollywood actors who have

34
00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.560
been in major box office successes who
are out to their friends and family but

35
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.280
not to the public which some say is as
bad as them lying to their fans

36
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
but why do fans have a right to know
who's dating who I blame Ben Affleck and

37
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.180
Jennifer Lopez for this they helped
reignite the celebrity couple industry

38
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.660
back in the 90s and it hasn't died down
since the parasocial environment of

39
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.200
Twitter and Instagram has allowed the
walls to fall down between fans and

40
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.519
celebrities where once fans only read
what stars publicists wanted them to

41
00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.239
read now they can keep up with their
faves on an almost minute-by-minute

42
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.500
basis so of course they want to know
everything about them because they feel

43
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.060
more like long-distance friends now than
Hollywood stars which is bad enough when

44
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.780
it comes to straight people but it's
doubly bad for queer people because our

45
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.540
privacy can in far too many cases be the
only barrier keeping us safe from

46
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
violent bigots the walls we put up can
be very important and create a safe Zone

47
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
in a world where our safety is
apparently Up For Debate I've been

48
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.879
thinking about all of this for quite
some time but it all started to

49
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.760
crystallize in my mind when I read the
book the cabin at the End of the World

50
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.360
by Paul G Tremblay since a film
adaptation of it entitled knock at the

51
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.680
cabin was being readied for release and
in the pages of this book

52
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.019
I saw how queer privacy can be so easily
neglected but before we get into that I

53
00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.900
want to talk to you about how you can
protect your own privacy with this

54
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.980
video's sponsor atlasvpn who are
currently running a major discount on a

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.819
three-year subscription amounting to
only 1.99 a month with a 30-day

56
00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.080
money-back guarantee online privacy is
becoming more and more important as our

57
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.120
lives shift Evermore to exclusively
online spaces as someone who was doxed

58
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.080
only within the last few months I know
how important it is for your location to

59
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.360
be as opaque as possible online Atlas
has also been incredibly helpful for

60
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.720
this channel as well since some of the
content we cover isn't legally available

61
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.919
in Canada without an absurdly priced
cable package I've been able to use

62
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.639
their geolocation feature to convince
certain streaming services that I'm

63
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.600
actually in the US giving me access to a
lot of the queer content I wouldn't have

64
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080
access to in Canada and I get to
actually support those queer shows

65
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.340
instead of pirating them which is pretty
nice Atlas VPN also keeps your Google

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.320
tricking websites into thinking that
you're a local buyer instead of an

69
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.600
international one this has helped me a
lot with my ever increasing anime merch

70
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.800
collection as I descend further and
further into weebdum and it's just the

because this is less about knock at the
cabin and more about knock at the cabin

there will be spoilers skip ahead to
part two policy reminder if you want to

79
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.039
see the movie and going fresh if you
don't want to see the movie we're not

80
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.280
going to hinge everything on knowing
what happens in the plot so you're not

81
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.000
going to be kept out of the loop I'm
basing these ideas entirely on the book

82
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.600
though titled cabin at the end of the
world because you know the movie wasn't

83
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.960
out when I wrote this judging from the
trailers it seems like the movie is

84
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.340
following the plot pretty closely though
however given how the book ends

85
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.660
I could foresee a studio maybe wanting
to change that ending some things you

86
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.900
can get away with in books that
audiences simply will not tolerate if

87
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.500
they see it on screen anyway knock at
the cabin's General premise is that a

88
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.220
pair of gay fathers take their adopted
daughter to a secluded cabin getaway a

89
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.780
group of hooligans show up and barges in
and takes the family hostage with the

90
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.979
intent of causing violence before you
say been there done that the twist is

91
00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.479
that the group is a doomsday cult that's
trying to prevent the end of the world

92
00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.560
according to them unless the gay family
picks one family member and chooses to

93
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.900
kill them the world will come to an end

94
00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:16.680
the group demonstrates that they are not
full of [ __ ] it's a long story but the

95
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.580
audience can be confident that these
cultists really can prophesy the end of

96
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.780
the world and they're not just whack job
religious nuts looking for a gay bashing

97
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.699
which is kind of scarier

98
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.020
the daughter gets killed which is why I
said they may want to change the ending

99
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.740
of this movie because that's a little
dark work for the big screen but M Night

100
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.360
Shyamalan has gone to pretty dark places
before even with kids so

101
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.240
Maybe
[Music]

102
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.759
but because it's the cultists who
accidentally kill the girl and not the

103
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.199
other two members of the gay family the
apocalypse prevention plan is void and

104
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.220
the reader and presumably the movie
going audience is led to believe though

105
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.500
remains unsure that the apocalypse is
still DTF if anything they may swap out

106
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.740
the daughter for one of the husbands to
make it a little bit more palatable in

107
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.340
the movie but the ambiguous Supernatural
world ending has some serious Shyamalan

108
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.419
Vibe so I can assume that this is where
the movie is headed the point remains

109
00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:20.160
however the continuation of the world
hinges on the destruction of a queer

110
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.120
family which
I didn't really even think of that when

111
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.080
I first read the book someone pointed it
out to me on a stream and then

112
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.700
you can't really unthink what has been
thought but here we go because that idea

113
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.120
opens the story up to a myriad of
different readings when something isn't

114
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.080
just about showing representation for
representation's sake that means it's

115
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.120
about something which means
there's a lot to unpack here the book

116
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.260
was written by Paul G Tremblay though
you wouldn't know that from the movie's

117
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.420
marketing leading me to believe that the
daughter might actually get killed and M

118
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.600
night doesn't want anyone reading the
book and spoiling the ending there isn't

119
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.920
as much biographical information about
Tremblay as say other horror authors

120
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.880
like Stephen King but in the context of
queerness everything I could find about

121
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.120
him indicates that he is straight and
while I continue to hold my position

122
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.800
that you should not need to be of a
certain identity to create characters of

123
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.700
that identity there are some life
experiences that are a little bit

124
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.300
sensitive to that particular community
in the queer Community for instance

125
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.680
violence against us is one of them
violenced against our families is

126
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.000
something that our art has only really
begun to explore for instance 2017's

127
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.899
American Horror Story cult explored this
and that was the first time it popped up

128
00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.560
on my radar however when it comes to
knock at the cabin the book and

129
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.700
presumably the movie one of the strange
selling points is that the queerness of

130
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.500
the dads is more or less irrelevant to
the plot in the book one of the fathers

131
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.279
has a flashback to a queer bashing but
aside from that it's entirely not a

132
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:54.480
topic of discussion really in fact the
cultists go out of their way to say that

133
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.380
they're super duper not homophobic but
given that this is a Creator who is

134
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.459
explicitly making a decision to write
outside his lived experiences

135
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:06.959
why did he write it like this because
the story would have been exactly the

136
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:09.660
same
if it was swapped out for a straight

137
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.580
couple one of whom had been attacked in
the past what statements May Tremblay be

138
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.779
making what readings could we take from
this story there are of course positive

139
00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:22.260
messages an argument for queer sympathy
would implore the reader to acknowledge

140
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.580
the threat the queer people and their
budding families are put under in this

141
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.660
new age of
tepid queer acceptance it may be that

142
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.500
the real tragedy is that this queer
family went through all the trouble in

143
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.120
rigmaro of eking out adoption only for
the child to be ripped away anyway

144
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.080
especially with the condition of the
American Supreme Court it's altogether

145
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.339
not out of the question that children
could be taken away from their queer

146
00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:50.519
mothers and fathers just look at what's
happening to trans children and their

147
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.880
supportive biological parents in the
southern states right now however if

148
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.019
that's the intended reading it's kind of
weak because while adoption is a very

149
00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:02.760
long methodical expensive struggle so
are fertility treatments for women the

150
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.880
threat of violence against a child you
worked exceptionally hard to produce is

151
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.480
not a fear that is exclusive to queer
families and quite frankly

152
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.980
neither is it option the most optimistic
dare I say queer positive reading of the

153
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.120
story is that Tremblay is speaking to
the family bond within queer families

154
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.500
being just as strong as they would be
among straight ones the entire story is

155
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.760
built on the premise that both queer
fathers are unwilling and incapable of

156
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.380
sacrificing another of the trio a death
only occurs by accident whereas queer

157
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.800
detractors may assume that one or both
of the fathers would just be willing to

158
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.959
throw the family away to save their own
skin and honestly

159
00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:42.980
come a bit closer

160
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:50.459
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret
I think that may be the intended reading

161
00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:54.420
okay just between us however even though
that's a possible takeaway the story is

162
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.620
still built around fantasizing trauma
tragedy and violence upon a queer family

163
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.060
and that still makes me a little bit
uncomfortable just taking a look at the

164
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.860
Optics of the story because in spite of
these readings there remains some very

165
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.839
very homophobic ones first off the
continuation of the world is predicated

166
00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:16.500
on a queer family's destruction this
could be interpreted as queer families

167
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.120
being a threat to societal cohesion or
such vagaries that are pushed by

168
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.899
right-wing pundits another reading would
claim that queer rights as a whole need

169
00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:28.500
to be put away to focus on more
apocalyptic features of our current

170
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.180
world things like climate change
economic collapse plagues and this

171
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.140
never-ending string of conflicts that
we've been embroiled in since 9 11. the

172
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.300
latter of which I'm partially convinced
future historians are actually going to

173
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.959
refer to as World War III this could
hold a certain make America great again

174
00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:51.000
kind of nostalgia that sort of remaps
History to insert that Society he really

175
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.620
started to take a nosedive when the gays
began insisting that they needed to

176
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.339
start families and that if we're gonna
stop the world from burning down it's a

177
00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:03.120
small price to pay to put the boot down
on some home-making Queens the

178
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.540
interesting Nuance behind this story
though is that the cultists cannot be

179
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.800
the ones to murder one of the family
members it must be the Family itself

180
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.000
that breaks up from within translated
into a real world suggestion that the

181
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.079
onus is on queer families to break up on
their own volition in order to maintain

182
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:23.579
social order because if the government
or bigots do these actions against queer

183
00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:28.399
families then the social outcry will
dissolve social cohesion regardless

184
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:32.459
instead if queerness quietly goes back
into the closet

185
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:36.540
all will be right with the world an even
more negative reading of the story could

186
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.560
contain a nasty message of queer people
saying provided how much violence has

187
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.240
been used against you and your community
historically is it not irresponsible for

188
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.000
you to start families and invite
children into that kind of threat of

189
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.519
violence
which

190
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:55.019
would be wrong because we don't blame
victims for their circumstances even if

191
00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:58.200
the objective is to be normal the
condition of queer rights is predicated

192
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.600
on the ability to choose how you want to
fit into the heterohegemony or not

193
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.720
without persecution now granted these
very negative readings of the story are

194
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.000
all far more nuanced than bigots and
right Wingers or quite frankly centrists

195
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.779
are usually capable of demonstrating and
I want to be clear I am not saying that

196
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:23.820
Paul G Tremblay or M Night Shyamalan are
queerphobic Paul G Tremblay not a

197
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.019
homophobe until explicitly demonstrated
otherwise and quite frankly he may very

198
00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:32.579
well be bisexual pansexual or asexual
you don't need to only marry dudes to be

199
00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:36.600
a queer man his identity is only really
important for questioning why it was so

200
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.500
important for this story to be focused
on a queer family it would help us

201
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.300
understand what the intended takeaway
could be however within the story there

202
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.160
is a lack of guiding framing devices to
really suggest what the takeaway should

203
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.180
be the presence of homophobic readings
is not necessarily a problem with the

204
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.339
story but a problem with the fact that
these are real issues and real

205
00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:03.300
discussions that are imposed on the
queer Community from the outside the

206
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.220
fact that these readings are possible is
concerning but only because these

207
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.060
reflect the bigotry we actually
experience in day-to-day life in a world

208
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.380
without homophobia this story would not
be remarkable for the sake of gay dads

209
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.639
but rather the weird apocalyptic cult
and vague paranormal overtones make no

210
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:25.019
mistake violence against us is a threat
to our immediate safety

211
00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:29.399
but these ideological discussions around
our identity are pivotal to the ongoing

212
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:33.660
progress to facilitate our long-term
security the fight for our rights needs

213
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.060
to be both reactionary and methodical we
need an ideal objective to know how we

214
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.500
should navigate immediate threats in
order to strategically move towards our

215
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.699
long-term goals and even the reactionary
Solutions are not usually efficient they

216
00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:51.779
are necessary until we can progress our
rights to a point where we do not need

217
00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:56.040
those kind of solutions for instance at
least in America where the story takes

218
00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.079
place leaning on the Supreme Court for
what rights have been won for us may not

219
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:04.260
have been the best plan if only
retrospectively now that the Supreme

220
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.980
Court has decided the former rulings no
longer matter if the immediate goal was

221
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.720
marriage getting that goal by any means
necessary may have compromised the

222
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.220
long-term progress to

223
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.480
was there even a plan of what to do
after the marriage fight Was Won

224
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.540
regardless of whether the Creator is
involved in this project are gay or

225
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.120
straight I feel like such a hot button
discussion

226
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.720
ought to have warranted a greater
sensitivity for diminishing the presence

227
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.120
of these readings if homophobic readings
are present then there are ways to make

228
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.600
it more difficult for the audience to
come away with that reading for instance

229
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.540
yes there is a straight reading of Yuri
on ice because the confirmation was

230
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.279
never verbalized however the mental
gymnastics you have to do in order to

231
00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:54.180
justify their straightness is in itself
worthy of a gold medal many of you may

232
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.839
insist that this is just a story and
that nobody's going to take these

233
00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:01.920
homophobic messages away from it but
keep in mind that Ted Cruz took away a

234
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.720
reading of Star Wars that singled out
Luke Skywalker as a randian objectivist

235
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.620
when are we supposed to take messaging
for face value like in Star Wars and how

236
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.220
are we supposed to distinguish that from
media where the intended takeaway is

237
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.760
buried in subtext like my go-to example
of Fight Club where the condemning

238
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.699
takeaway is actually more clear in the
book The Answer usually lies in the

239
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:25.020
resolution and unfortunately when it
comes to knock at the cabin the ending

240
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.740
is a bit too ambiguous to be definitive
and in spite of the fact that these

241
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.419
cultists are explicitly described as not
gay bashing wackos the setting is

242
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:37.200
indicative of these aforementioned queer
anxieties especially when a straight

243
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.440
couple would have accomplished the exact
same story without nearly as much

244
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.559
baggage cynically I may add that perhaps
the couple was made to be gay

245
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:51.840
for no other reason than to distinguish
them from a range of other murderous

246
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.860
stranger shows up at a family's rural
residence stories which again is more

247
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.400
likely than deliberate homophobia the
fact of the matter is that this kind of

248
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.140
narrative is popping up in a period of
time when queer people are coming under

249
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.700
a new wave of threats where many of us
are being attacked and forced out of

250
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.960
spaces we believed could be safe see we
don't really have to be worried about

251
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.000
bigotry knocking at our door anymore as
much as we worry about bigotry showing

252
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.260
up in our DMs

253
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.000
the internet was a revolutionary tool
for the organization of queer rights our

254
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.299
leaders had depended on phone calls and
then spreading information through

255
00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:36.840
newsletters and bulletins in the New
Millennium online communities could grow

256
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.919
up at a chat rooms blogs and early
social media platforms like Myspace if

257
00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:44.700
information passes easier then we can
organize easier queer communities

258
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.980
gravitated to digital spaces because
unlike other marginalized communities we

259
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.740
did not have generational districts
which we were born into a lesbian was

260
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.419
just as likely to be born into a family
in rural South Dakota as one in Brooklyn

261
00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:05.520
whereas a homogeneously white community
in Maine was not likely to suddenly have

262
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.299
a large group of Lebanese children born
into the Maternity Ward ethnic

263
00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:13.140
communities in cities where immigrant
families typically pooled were not only

264
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.400
tightly knit but were densely packed
into a few city blocks like Little Italy

265
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.880
or various chinatowns or black
neighborhoods word of mouth was much

266
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.240
more effective at passing through these
areas because most people in the

267
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.320
communities were in these areas while
there may be a gay district of a city

268
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.220
the queer population may be concentrated
here but most queer people may live

269
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.120
throughout the city and commute between
their residents and these Buyers Clubs

270
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.240
and wherever else that the community has
organized for this reason internet

271
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.140
organizations have been revolutionary
for the disabled the deaf and hard of

272
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.700
hearing or any other communities that
are mostly ignored through random

273
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.039
sampling which is why Elon musk's
Twitter meltdowns would be hilarious if

274
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:57.780
it wasn't for the fact that the platform
is essential for a lot of people's

275
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.039
advocacy organizing in the modern world
if anything else the gays are Savvy I

276
00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:05.700
may have recently come under criticism
for claiming that the AIDS epidemic took

277
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.780
a grand majority of our brilliant
creative minds leaving out exceptions

278
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:15.179
like Andy Warhol who by some accounts
was asexual or Elton John who by all

279
00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:18.539
accounts was not naturally not all
interesting gay people were horny and

280
00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:22.200
not all of them her War horny were taken
from us this is based on what could have

281
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.980
been in the 1980s and 90s based on the
prominence of queer creators in the 70s

282
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.820
and 60s
and just how many queer people died of

283
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.260
AIDS related complications in general in
spite of that this shouldn't suggest we

284
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.340
lost our brilliant industrious Minds
queer newsletters and Publications took

285
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.179
a swift turn to online spaces as our
fights around the world began to turn to

286
00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:46.620
marriage equality in Europe and America
and basic rights and protections in many

287
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.120
other places this information Mobility
helped spread awareness demonstrate the

288
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.620
power of the community and soften the
general public's opinion of us and

289
00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.360
overall helped us organize at a much
swifter rate than otherwise it's no

290
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.700
surprise that as home computers became
standard in every household queer rights

291
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.299
started to actually make tangible
progress for the first time however

292
00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:14.280
while our leaders were tech savvy our
bigoted detractors did eventually catch

293
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.020
up the internet made it much easier for
them to harass us it seems before they

294
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.380
needed to either live in LA San
Francisco New York or any of the other

295
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.760
significant urban areas to harass us on
mass or actually pay for postage to send

296
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.600
a hateful letter but it came to be that
they could just fire off some emails or

297
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.159
invade message boards almost every queer
person I know has gotten some kind of

298
00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:39.240
hate email or DM hate mail for queer
people especially creators and people

299
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.400
with a platform range from structured
sermons with Biblical references to just

300
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.419
unhinged ranting tirades which amount to
nothing more than a collection of red

301
00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:52.980
flag buzzwords accusing us of sexually
perverse actions and promising any range

302
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.220
of violent retributions so basically
running the gamut of Republican

303
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.200
politicians ask anyone with a halfway
prominent platform anonymity and privacy

304
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.220
are Illusions for those who know how
with a little patience dedication and

305
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.760
untreated mental illness it can be a
relatively simple process to find

306
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.320
someone's personal information or even
an address doxing is a very real threat

307
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.460
for people who are already the target of
discrimination coupled with the fact

308
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.240
that law enforcement have historically
under investigated crimes and violence

309
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.100
against queer victims doxing someone is
among the greatest flexes of privilege

310
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.260
because it acknowledges that the target
does not have a viable recourse for

311
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.980
violence against them and no you cannot
get doxed if you live in a historic

312
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.620
Scottish Manner and have already made
the purchase of said property very

313
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.340
public though
admittedly given that doxing can often

314
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.000
be a dog whistle for a death threat I
can understand the anxiety it plays off

315
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.780
of the classic I know where you live
Trope in horror movies where the

316
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.900
possible victim is reminded that they
are not safe in a place that they had

317
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.380
assumed they would be sure someone
throwing homophobic slurs in public is

318
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.820
one thing but once the slurs and threats
are coming from inside the house

319
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.440
things get very real very fast doxing
and threats are becoming one of the most

320
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.140
common ways to silence queer voices even
as our detractors claim queer people do

321
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.919
it to them I'm sure they do but there
are significantly less of us than there

322
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:17.400
are of them and their platforms are
traditionally much larger to the point

323
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.179
where all Joanne tweeting at a prominent
trans figurehead could be adjacent to

324
00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:25.140
putting out a social media hit at best
we can hope the hit stays within the

325
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.500
twitterverse the frustrating part is
that

326
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.140
as these dog whistling bigots blanket us
all as barbarians for actions they too

327
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.400
engage in
queer people stare down lists of threats

328
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.220
and criticism
for simply existing

329
00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:52.620
there's always been pressure for queer
people to cover in public covering as

330
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.299
anamari Vida kinen describes it refers
to queer people toning down their

331
00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:01.679
sexuality in order to fit better or
easier into mainstream Society the

332
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:06.360
expectation that queer people cover is
acknowledged as establishing a system of

333
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.799
Oppression that coerces queer people to
act in specific ways with substantial

334
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:15.480
threats of punishment for not doing so
when it is expected of them no holding

335
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.960
hands in public for instance and
certainly no kissing in public almost

336
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.320
every gay teenager has the fantasy of
being just as affectionate with their

337
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.380
real or in most cases imaginary
boyfriend or girlfriend as their

338
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.640
straight friends are but there is an
immediate fear when those thoughts enter

339
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.559
your mind of the repercussions of doing
so there did seem to be some movement on

340
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:37.740
this front in the last couple of decades
it used to be that you had to go to the

341
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.820
gay hotspots of Castro Street Chelsea or
Church Street to feel comfortable and

342
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.059
safe expressing your queerness unless
there was a pride parade going on but

343
00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:49.679
when I was in my late teens I saw shift
to where a queer person could be

344
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:54.059
comfortable being themselves
the map seemed to open up to include

345
00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:57.960
most major cities and even small towns
gays were making out on every street

346
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.320
corner in America according to
conservatives this was never really the

347
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.320
case
but it's the image that was sent out by

348
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.919
the mainstream media that homophobia had
for the most part been dealt with

349
00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:11.520
especially after gay marriage started
going mainstream if we could get married

350
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.080
we must have won the war but fights over
people refusing to issue marriage

351
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.020
licenses and refusing to bake wedding
cakes

352
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:24.299
painted a very different picture we
hadn't won the war we'd merely back the

353
00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:28.380
enemy into a corner
and now they felt threatened enough to

354
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.360
retaliate in any way they saw fit Los
Angeles a city most would consider

355
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.419
pretty queer friendly saw a 21 increase
in gay hate crimes in 2021 alone marking

356
00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:45.120
the highest rate of such hate crimes in
18 years gay men with a target of 85

357
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.980
percent of these crimes meanwhile 93
percent of anti-trans hate crimes that

358
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.940
were reported were violent in nature
this percentage of violence was greater

359
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.200
than any other stigmatized group that
was recorded by the 2021 hate crimes

360
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.279
Report law enforcement expect that these
figures only represent a small portion

361
00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:06.419
of the actual total number of instances
that were motivated by hatred since many

362
00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:10.440
would go unreported due to people not
being out of the closet feeling ashamed

363
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.539
or a lingering animosity toward police
from the queer community in fact hate

364
00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:20.580
crimes targeting LGBT individuals have
climbed for the past four straight years

365
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.020
according to data published by the FBI
all of this coincided with a rise in

366
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.100
right-wing thinking across North America
and Europe one unnamed Republican

367
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.700
staffer said to the Atlantic
conservatives who came before us were

368
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.620
insufferably naive they thought liberals
and conservatives both want what's best

369
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.380
for America disagreeing only on how to
get there but that's not true woke

370
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:49.559
Elites increasingly the mainstream left
of this country do not want what we want

371
00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:55.260
what they want is to destroy us the rise
in right-wing radicalism seen in the

372
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.279
likes of the Maga movement the
increasing hate toward trans people and

373
00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:04.200
the surprising rise of actual fascists
like Francis Marie Lepa lines up

374
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.880
directly with the rise of lgbtq hate
crimes trans people had been the main

375
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.539
target of these groups with trans
bathroom access drawing the ire of

376
00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:16.980
so-called feminists who thought that
dangerous men would actually put in the

377
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.299
effort to dress as a woman to gain
access to women's bathrooms

378
00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:25.559
they don't do that this gave gay men a
sense of safety I think believing that

379
00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:29.700
the target had shifted and so we gaze
could relax but the people who hate the

380
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.860
lgbtq community don't really give a damn
which letter you associate with since

381
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.880
attacks on gay men have been on the rise
recently with the growing fervor over

382
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.740
the groomer anti-queer propaganda
according to the center on extremism

383
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.179
this misleading and deceptive story has
been weaponized in order to characterize

384
00:27:48.179 --> 00:27:52.080
members of the queer Community as
groomers in their effort to discredit

385
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.000
those who identify as queer these
anti-queer Fanatics have misused a valid

386
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.679
phrase that is tied to sexual assault
rain rape abuse and incest national

387
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:05.400
network the largest anti-sexual violence
organization in the United States

388
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.500
defines grooming as manipulative
behaviors used by sexual abusers to gain

389
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.600
access to a potential victim coerce them
into agreeing to be abused and reduce

390
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.919
the risk of being caught words like
grooming and groomer are not used in a

391
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:23.520
proper context by anti-queers people
instead they argue that talking about

392
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.080
sexual orientation and gender identity
in public in general makes queer

393
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.860
individuals pedophiles who prey on
children they say that queer people are

394
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.520
trying to sexualize children and recruit
them by introducing them to these

395
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.179
subjects at an early age in the hopes
that they would begin to question their

396
00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:42.720
own gender and sexual identities the
result of this widespread hateful

397
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.640
rhetoric has been a spike in harassment
threats and violence especially toward

398
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.720
gay men and trans people across the U.S
extremists and mainstream conservatives

399
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.400
alike employ this rhetoric to harass the
queer Community painting us as child

400
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.360
predators and criminals which not only
increases the likelihood of hate crimes

401
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.520
being committed against us but also of
us as previously mentioned covering

402
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.900
the right wing knows the queer people
aren't going anywhere that we exist and

403
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.919
will continue to exist but they see this
as the perfect opportunity to drive us

404
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:17.940
back into our closets if they could just
make us go into hiding again so that

405
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.419
they don't have to see us so they don't
have to acknowledge our existence these

406
00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:25.440
attacks both physical and verbal are
meant to do that they're meant to make

407
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.340
being queer so dangerous that no one in
their right mind would do it in public

408
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.100
and it's not just crazies on the
Internet or whack job Congress people

409
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.000
driving at this either actual members of
the United States Supreme Court have

410
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.779
floated the idea of repealing gay rights
laws in America Clarence Thomas in

411
00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:43.799
particular has been vocal about his
intentions to roll back gay rights

412
00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:48.360
bluntly stating that Lawrence V Texas
the 2003 ruling that decriminalized gay

413
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:53.460
sex in the U.S and the 2015 ruling in
oberger fell vs Hodges which said that

414
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.039
there is a right to same-sex marriage
should be overturned as they were quote

415
00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:04.520
demonstrably erroneous decisions
foreign

416
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.820
Thomas's call for a re-examination of
these rulings carries no weight in law

417
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.260
and cannot compel his Supreme Court
colleagues to follow his lead the

418
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.279
implication though is that conservative
State legislatures Should draft laws

419
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:21.240
that conflict with Supreme Court
precedent in the hopes that the court

420
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.600
would overturn its previous decisions
which

421
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.880
with the Roe v Wade decision of 2022
wouldn't be out of the question so these

422
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.500
wars that we had ostensibly won
which had at worse developed into

423
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.880
cultural cold Wars
seem to be heating back up

424
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.020
the U.S Congress did pass the right to
Marriage Act in 2022 signed by President

425
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.279
Biden but it's mostly toothless it
wouldn't require states to license

426
00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:52.200
same-sex marriages but it would require
states to recognize same-sex marriages

427
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.720
performed in other states attorney Paul
Smith said it's designed not to mandate

428
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.700
a given state to marry anyone they don't
want to marry instead if you found some

429
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.360
place to get married everyone has to
treat you as married

430
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.940
that's less of an intrusion on the
sovereignty of states in other words the

431
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.279
sovereignty of states is more important
than the Dignity of the people who live

432
00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:21.120
in them so this all leads to a very
uncomfortable question

433
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.640
does our visibility
only make us more vulnerable

434
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.840
especially when the government is only
willing to pass halfway measures of

435
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.200
protection

436
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.700
I think that maybe we've given the
impression along the way that we won't

437
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.419
fight back against threats to us it used
to be that when the government refused

438
00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:49.380
to protect us or when it was even the
government that was doing harm to us we

439
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.580
would mobilize and demonstrate our
community took to the streets to protest

440
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:58.080
harmful legislation or violence against
us we demonstrated the strength of our

441
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.360
numbers we demonstrated that our
Humanity was not rooted in our ability

442
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:09.480
to passively endure in complacent
silence the fight for our rights was

443
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.460
fruitless when fought from offices and
boardrooms by gay lawyers who wore suits

444
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.380
it wasn't until we started shouting at
the public that like anybody else we

445
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:25.200
have a point where enough is enough it's
been said that Pride was a riot

446
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.100
but that's only half true before it was
a parade and platform for overpriced

447
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.480
corporate sponsorships Pride was an
organization that stood for personal

448
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.820
rights in defense and education Pride
was first formed in LA in 1966 from the

449
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.000
very beginning they were considerably
more radical than the gay rights groups

450
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.620
that existed prior to them in the 1960s
and 50s before then gay rights groups

451
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.580
were more deferential to the ideas of
straight people as opposed to the more

452
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.539
conservative strategy that was followed
by Pride's predecessors the primary

453
00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:58.740
objective of Pride was to engage in
political action and protests that were

454
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.539
as boisterous and as loud as possible in
order to confront the opposition

455
00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:08.220
to stand up and make a point it was this
kind of action that would write the

456
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.080
how-to manual for future groups like act
up to force government action when

457
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.500
compared to other organizations Pride
had a greater degree of success in

458
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.299
rallying huge numbers of people to Stage
demonstrations against any group or

459
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:24.779
individual who denied members of the
queer Community their equal rights or

460
00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:30.419
dignity but in 1968 the year before the
famous Stonewall riots Pride was

461
00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:34.500
dissolved due to ever increasing
pressure from The Straits and even a

462
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.480
number of gays in the community to sit
down shut up and be polite this be nice

463
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.799
to our oppressors strategy led to
exponentially more arrests and attacks

464
00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:47.519
against queer people however one night
in New York City a group of gay men

465
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:52.559
lesbians and trans women had had enough
and fought back lighting the flame of

466
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:58.200
the Stonewall riots and the modern lgbtq
Rights Movement but today

467
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.519
we as a community seem much more timid
much more willing to take a backhand to

468
00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:07.440
the face literally or metaphorically as
long as it doesn't make us look bad

469
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.060
it only makes the bigots look bad right
that's why there's so few of them now

470
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.379
and they have like zero political power
can't get anyone elected to save their

471
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:20.580
lives and certainly don't tell bigoted
rhetoric in public and never confront

472
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.839
anyone over their gender identity in a
public bathroom

473
00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:27.960
that's sarcasm by the way not to be
alarmist

474
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.099
but it does seem like these people are
only gaining political power there are

475
00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:35.639
right Wingers who label themselves
activists because they've convinced

476
00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:40.619
themselves that they often wait if not
wealthy are being

477
00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:44.520
persecuted people like that Republican
staffer I mentioned earlier whose name

478
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.780
is Rachel bovard by the way claim that
this political party which is really an

479
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.919
ideology not an identity is under threat
of Destruction and whether or not

480
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:57.540
they're delusional enough to actually
believe it their supporters sure do they

481
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.260
are gaining more and more power within
the Republican party we used to think

482
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.220
the Tea Party caucus was crazy now
they've disbanded because they weren't

483
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.700
crazy enough for these new ones and
these are the people we're supposed to

484
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:14.940
negotiate with to be kind and empathetic
with to compromise with and put on our

485
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.560
best behavior for
because we must be polite to our

486
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.480
oppressors
because even as they decry us denounce

487
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.339
us insult us confront us question us
harm us and silence us it all becomes a

488
00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:35.220
discussion of their feelings doesn't it
how dare we silence them for trying to

489
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.320
suppress us and oppress us
we're so afraid of these people turning

490
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.980
around and calling us bullies that we
become toothless

491
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.420
what are we gonna do start a hashtag on
Twitter March on Washington or state

492
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.920
capital for a weekend and then go home
we're certainly not going to fight for

493
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.640
our rights and Security in any way that
will remind the population at large that

494
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.560
bigotry is never in season we used to do
that

495
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:07.560
but we haven't in a long long time
we thought our safety was secured

496
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.240
the doors and windows to the house in
which our rights seemed so safe were

497
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.780
locked up tight
and so we could sleep soundly and move

498
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:21.060
on with our lives
but we seemingly forgot that windows

499
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.200
are only made of glass

500
00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:28.560
through which the bigots could see us
and then smash through when they got

501
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.160
sick of seeing us and take away our
safety

502
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.720
does that mean we should draw the
curtains and hide in the closets

503
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.940
no hell no we used to have queer guard
dogs that would fight but most of them

504
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:47.220
died in the 80s and 90s and others were
put down because some of us thought they

505
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.400
were too much to handle
the neighbors might be offended by how

506
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.119
loudly they barked
but with the repeal of abortion rights

507
00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:57.300
and voting rights in America our
neighbors houses have now been broken

508
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.920
into
and our Windows have been smashed

509
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.140
so I think it's time we get some new
guard dogs loud vicious Unstoppable

510
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.980
forces of protection that will scare the
[ __ ] out of these bigots and send them

511
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.180
running home
put a big rainbow colored sign on the

512
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.530
front fence beware the queers
they bite back
