00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.800
nintendo is a company that is perceived
as very conservative socially and in

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.560
their business practices
which isn't really wrong there's a

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.679
reason they've been able to weather the
ups and downs of the video game industry

7
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.600
for the last four decades without laying
off half of their staff but it's the

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.960
socially conservative part that i think
we get wrong

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.640
for instance nintendo has this odd dare
i say woke history of action when it

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.840
comes to gender in gaming
like

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.360
while the gamergate harassment campaign
against

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.120
literally anyone who wasn't a straight
white male was going on nintendo

13
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.160
released a video game where their most
iconic characters dressed up as cat boys

14
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.760
and a girl
and meow at each other but nintendo's

15
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.640
gender journey didn't start in 2013.
they've been on this raucous roller

16
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.280
coaster ride since
well

17
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.479
since the original nintendo
entertainment system so let's have a

18
00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.840
look back at the grand history of
nintendo and its confusingly progressive

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.920
yet conservative stance on gender

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.950
not looking forward to the comment

nintendo was first founded as yamauchi

25
00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.000
nintendo in 1889 in kyoto japan at first
they solely produced and marketed

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.239
hanafuda playing cards the cards soon
began to rise in popularity and the

27
00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.959
company had to expand to meet the
increasing demand fast forward to 1959

28
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.520
when nintendo made a deal with disney to
allow the use of disney's characters on

29
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.200
nintendo's playing cards because disney
can't

30
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.840
not be associated with anything i talk
about apparently in 1963 the company

31
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.280
which had changed its name to the
nintendo playing card company changed

32
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
its name once again
this time to simply nintendo by

33
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.040
generalizing their name they were able
to expand their businesses into markets

34
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.760
such as snack foods toy production taxi
companies and

35
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.879
love hotels if you don't know what a
love hotel is it's a type of hotel you

36
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.040
can stay in for a short stay as in
an hour or two what we call a no-tell

37
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.200
motel with a nice lounge that's right
squeaky clean family-friendly nintendo

38
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.040
owned a hotel designed for quick sex
with sex workers and mistresses but

39
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.159
because the typical japanese home at the
time was very small sometimes with

40
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.519
shared living arrangements between the
parents and children these hotels began

41
00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.720
to be used by parents to escape their
children for a few hours to

42
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
you know go make more children which
lent the establishments a bit more of an

43
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.200
air of legitimacy however all these
ventures eventually failed except toy

44
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.120
production based on some earlier
experience from selling playing cards in

45
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.440
1964 while japan was experiencing an
economic boom the playing card business

46
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.920
reached saturation leading households to
stop buying new playing cards and the

47
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.840
price of nintendo stock dropped from 900
yen to 60 yen per share during the 1960s

48
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.599
nintendo struggled to survive in the
japanese toy industry which was already

49
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.360
being dominated by bandai and had yet to
become the global powerhouse that it is

50
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.599
today but in 1972 the first commercially
available video game console the

51
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.840
magnavox odyssey went on the market
which required a light gun to play

52
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.920
certain games nintendo broke into the
video game industry by producing said

53
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.840
light gun nintendo saw how successful
video games were becoming and took its

54
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.879
first step in the gaming arena by
securing the rights to distribute the

55
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.000
magnavox odyssey in japan at the time
video game consoles were extremely rare

56
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.919
even pong consoles had yet to be
produced so after experiencing success

57
00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.519
and helping to sell other companies
products nintendo began developing its

58
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.199
own video games their first video arcade
game was 1975's evr race with a few more

59
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.240
following in the next couple of years
including radarscope and donkey kong

60
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.440
nintendo continued to see success in
producing arcade games including the

61
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.520
original mario brothers game but hid it
big in 1985 when they announced the

62
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.639
famicom or nintendo entertainment system
a bold move considering the industry had

63
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.320
completely cratered out in 1983 but this
little contraption took the world by

64
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.880
storm and nintendo became an icon
through releasing games like super mario

65
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.919
bros the legend of zelda and metroid the
super famicom or super nintendo followed

66
00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.240
in 1991 leading to a war between
nintendo and sega for the dominance of

67
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.039
the 16-bit video game generation which
nintendo handily won but consoles

68
00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.720
weren't nintendo's only video game
machine handheld gaming was always a

69
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.240
fascination with various companies
though handhelds were usually small

70
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.720
cheap and featured black images that
moved simply by swapping position on the

71
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.840
screen
nintendo's revolutionary game boy was a

72
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.560
clunky though still handheld device with
fully animated graphics like consoles it

73
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.400
could play different games based on
cartridges basically just a teeny tiny

74
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.080
console a philosophy that's carried on
to nintendo's current generation with

75
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.960
the switch though only black and white
and very low res the game boy spurred

76
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.080
nintendo's complete dominance over all
handheld gaming until smartphones this

77
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.240
is where nintendo launched some of its
most profitable titles primarily pokemon

78
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.320
but also popular tie-ins to metroid and
the legend of zelda with fans claiming

79
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.440
that some of each franchise's best
titles were released for the game boy

80
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.560
and eventually the ds in 1994 nintendo
announced that they had sold more than 1

81
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.560
billion game cartridges worldwide
one-tenth of which were mario games at

82
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.160
the same time nintendo announced project
reality a code name for what would later

83
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.240
become known as the nintendo 64 which
helped home console games move from

84
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.319
scrolling 2d images to fully revolving
3d ones and lead the way for some of the

85
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.720
most iconic games in gaming history
including mario 64 and the seminal best

86
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.000
reviewed game of all time legend of
zelda ocarina of time

87
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.960
[Music]
when it comes to content nintendo's

88
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.039
early game library didn't particularly
break the mole as far as storytelling

89
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.000
went woman is in danger man saves woman
stories were kept simple to avoid text

90
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.919
and it's not like the mid-80s were
locked in an era of simplicity final

91
00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.919
fantasy 1 made its debut not two years
after super mario and one year after the

92
00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.800
legend of zelda and neither was final
fantasy the first turn-based combat rpg

93
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.240
complex narratives were something that
video games explored at the earliest

94
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.199
available opportunity through text
adventures though there can be an

95
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.160
argument to say that even though video
game narratives of this era could be

96
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.080
long and even complex the stories
themselves and especially the characters

97
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.240
weren't really reinventing the wheel
boil it down and a lot of it was still

98
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.120
just sword man saves damsel see in the
long ago video games were seen as a

99
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.360
lesser form of media and especially when
your frame of reference was frogger q

100
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.599
bert and pac-man that wasn't going to
inspire any confidence that one day

101
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.720
we could be using video games to tell
epics that at times can match the pathos

102
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.360
if not the very prestige of cinema
competent storytellers were more liable

103
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.520
to be drawn towards other more
established forms of media like the

104
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.840
novel film or stage when you have a
truly good idea it seemed like a waste

105
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.400
of time to frame it in a media format
that will not be remembered and for

106
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.319
whose audience is incredibly narrow and
also a media format that likes to make

107
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.440
older games unavailable to play but we
won't talk about that in fact when we

108
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.520
look at film and even the novel both of
these were media formats that struggled

109
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.520
to fight for legitimacy early on early
filmmakers had to make do with a lot of

110
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.360
writers who either never managed to make
it big writing for the stage or who had

111
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.160
been forced out of the theatrical
community

112
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.560
and film didn't really begin to take off
until you had those early screenwriters

113
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.800
who really had the imagination to
explore how screen could be used in ways

114
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.440
that the stage could not perhaps it's
worth mentioning here that film actually

115
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.000
got its first artistic jump start
because it was seen as a lesser medium

116
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.120
and so women and black creators who
could not get work in proper art forms

117
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.519
flocked to early film studios where they
had creative freedom they began feeling

118
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:41.120
out the medium and found ways to make it
visually distinct from theater and

119
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.600
captivate audiences and once it was
clear that this new industry could be

120
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.360
profitable
they were pushed out of these spaces by

121
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.920
english white men who suddenly had an
interest in it funny story actually many

122
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.200
early films would be shot twice once
during the day for the english

123
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.440
production and once at night for a
different language usually spanish while

124
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.800
the white men went home and slept the
hispanic men moved on to the sound

125
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.800
stages having seen what was done earlier
on in the day and went on to improve

126
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.959
upon it in every way a really great
example of this is actually 1933's

127
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:16.800
dracula fellow lugosi is great but the
spanish version's better but outside of

128
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.800
film some of you may be shocked to hear
due to the fact that you had to read

129
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.680
about 50 of them in high school that the
novel

130
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.839
also did its time as a lesser form of
media though it's considered the staple

131
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:33.040
format of literature today the novel as
a format was regarded as pulp for most

132
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.800
of its life
the ugly stepchild of poetry non-fiction

133
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.600
essays and stage plays a long format
story which had no real structure

134
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.480
the author was seen as not having had
enough faith in their own idea to

135
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.959
convince a theater troupe to act it out
a last resort for bad ideas if you will

136
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:53.200
in fact early novels in europe had to
disguise themselves as factual accounts

137
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.640
like with robinson caruso while not the
first novel in human history its

138
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.200
publication date of 1719 is by some
scholars viewed as the birth date of the

139
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.839
novel format and as per a stigma against
made-up stories that were neither poetic

140
00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:10.320
nor theatric author and revel daniel
defoe included a foreword guaranteeing

141
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.079
that this account of a man marooned on
an island who threw a stick at a parrot

142
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:18.240
because he wanted a pet was entirely
factual it actually was inspired by a

143
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.440
real life story of a man who spent four
years marooned on an island off the

144
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.920
coast of chile but upon meeting said
sailor defoe was so disappointed in the

145
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.800
reality that he decided to fix some of
the more unremarkable details new

146
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800
artistic formats always take a couple of
generations to find their footing and

147
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.920
really figure out what the boundaries
and limits of their storytelling

148
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.120
capacities can be
each one faces their respective

149
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.040
challenges it wasn't until you had
creators who grew up reading novels that

150
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.600
the advantages of the novel really began
to shine the loose freeform style of

151
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.680
narrative allowed for quick changes of
scene tighter dialogue and given that

152
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.959
there was no poetic meter characters
could be developed and framed through

153
00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:01.279
their vernacular cadence and slang if
you've read much edgar allan poe you

154
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:05.440
know that this can also be done to a
fault film by contrast to theater

155
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.959
allowed for the director to have greater
artistic control over exactly what the

156
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:12.560
audience could see
rather than two people on a wide stage

157
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.399
the director could have the audience see
nothing but the speaking character

158
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:20.640
audiences could see nuances that even
people in the front row never could but

159
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.920
film also had the advantage of cutting
between characters and locations

160
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.120
controlling the emotional pace of a
scene or transferring between the scenes

161
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.360
and control over lighting specific
aspects or even individual characters of

162
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.160
a scene which came to be known as film
editing and cinematography respectively

163
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.519
both of which
are things that are incredibly difficult

164
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:43.600
to do on stage
and

165
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.120
which the oscars apparently don't care
about anymore

166
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.560
when it came to early games however the
focus was to create an engaging

167
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.720
entertainment experience there wasn't
really a push for political breakdowns

168
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.480
like you'd get in the first four seasons
of game of thrones like early films the

169
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.720
focus was for creators to feel out this
media format what were the limits of

170
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.680
this format what would audiences respond
to how will this technology develop and

171
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.040
in what direction will it drive the
creative side of the developmental

172
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.000
process delivering quality was second to
figuring out how to deliver anything at

173
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.800
all and if i have to say i'm not sure
video games have really figured out what

174
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.040
exactly their role in media is going to
be i feel like what we refer to

175
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.000
collectively as video games is actually
an umbrella term describing several

176
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.760
different and distinct formats of
digital immersion media and without

177
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.440
listing them i feel like the reason so
many big budget games end up being

178
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.399
disappointments
is that they're trying to be so many

179
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:44.639
different kinds of video games
without actually being good

180
00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:48.240
at any one of them but if there's any
aaa studio that isn't trying to cash in

181
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.079
on the whatever's popular last year
frankensteinian hybrid of skyrim the

182
00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:56.079
last of us final fantasy and
bungie produced halo games and thus

183
00:12:56.079 --> 00:13:00.320
focusing their resources on the game
part of video game

184
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.639
than it would be nintendo and maybe this
is why when other studios in the 1980s

185
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.600
were pushing video games to their
narrative boundaries nintendo was

186
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.760
focusing on minimal for granted
narrative tropes to focus on how to give

187
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.920
their flagship titles a clear and
distinct feeling whereas square would

188
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.399
have spent hours outlining and
suggesting the political and

189
00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.000
cosmic world state that led to zelda's
imprisonment

190
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.480
nintendo preferred to focus on game play
and design find a hole in the wall you

191
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.360
get a sword save the princess so yes
nintendo and most studios leaned on

192
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.120
existing narrative tropes that focused
on men as the hero

193
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.760
because in most cultures men dominated
fictional landscapes as protagonists and

194
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.040
principal characters and because
developers were still figuring out how

195
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.279
to code for increasingly complex
technology reinventing the narrative

196
00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:53.680
wheel wasn't really on the to-do list
and while this did lead to a foundation

197
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.639
of misogyny and homophobia in gaming the
narration style that often shafts women

198
00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:02.000
to supporting roles and ignores the
existence of queer people even while

199
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.959
using historical accuracy as an excuse
this shouldn't suggest that there

200
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:12.320
weren't attempts to subvert these tropes
when i say attempt it is both reverently

201
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.360
and also condemningly because when it
comes to a future space-faring society

202
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.360
where human limitations are expanded by
combat exoskeletons

203
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.720
you'd think it wouldn't be such a big
deal that a woman

204
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.680
could be powerful and yet
samus as a woman was the big reveal in

205
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.120
metroid and even then this was only
revealed after beating the game the

206
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.120
condemnation comes from the fact that
this was set up to be a big deal in the

207
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.120
first place a vision of the future
hundreds of years from now with the same

208
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.639
social expectations is kind of bleak and
also

209
00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:50.000
using underwear to indicate gender
excuse me that's breaking one of the

210
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.199
cardinal rules of science fiction they
bring me to george takes one look at me

211
00:14:55.199 --> 00:15:00.320
and he says you can't wear a bra
underneath that dress he says because

212
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.880
there's no underwear in space and the
man said it was such a conviction too

213
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.880
you know on the other hand my reverence
for this gender reveal post-credit scene

214
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.360
indicates a that nintendo was aware that
their audience would not have picked up

215
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.600
a game with a woman illustrated on the
cover and b they were gonna find a way

216
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.399
to force you to play as a woman even if
you didn't know it nintendo was going to

217
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:29.040
make probably their most badass
character even to this day a woman and

218
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.120
you have to respect that kind of
creative determination and perhaps to

219
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.759
the benefit of gender representation the
format of metroid games usually does not

220
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:41.279
permit a whole lot of story and
character because metroid is first and

221
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.600
foremost an action game there isn't
anything to them especially the first

222
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.040
one in the way of character development
samus as a badass doesn't really come

223
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.360
across that way due to cut scenes or
snappy one-liners thrown at vanquished

224
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.839
bosses don't
call me babe badassery is performed

225
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:03.920
exclusively by unscripted character
actions which could probably be expanded

226
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.839
to a greater statement about the gaming
experience as a whole players are more

227
00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:11.440
likely to connect with and accept
characters the more that they have

228
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.720
direct control over their actions the
more a player is exposed to a

229
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.839
character's capabilities through cut
scenes and references the more likely

230
00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:22.639
they are to be decried as a mary sue or
less likely a gary stew it's worth

231
00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.240
mentioning at this point that when the
series veered away from its format in

232
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.839
metroid other m
fans were none too pleased with the

233
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:34.800
result whereas before samus was powerful
and independent in other m she was

234
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.120
immature prone to weakness being
attributed to her being a woman and

235
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.680
reliant on male characters to be
effective and also other m was

236
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.519
wrought with
overwrought cut scenes that went on for

237
00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:51.440
far too long the more a character is
developed through cut scenes the less a

238
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.880
player is going to be able to believe
that this character is as capable as the

239
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.920
game is trying to tell you
gaming offers the ability to experience

240
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.720
things
that film

241
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.959
could only ever show you maybe this more
cinematic approach can work for certain

242
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:12.000
games like the last of us or uncharted
but the way the metroid brand had been

243
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.079
established before
fans simply didn't connect samus's

244
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:20.000
long-standing ability to appeal to
audiences was due to most if not all of

245
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.760
her actions being something that the
player could directly control there is

246
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.760
no need to suspend a player's disbelief
because the player themself

247
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.200
is being a badass by proxy of samus they
wholly believe and understand how samus

248
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.799
is a badass because they are using
samus's toolkit to accomplish the

249
00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:42.000
badassery but it could also be that
samus's long-standing celebration is

250
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.160
something that was grandfathered in from
an era where she was the girl in an

251
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.200
otherwise all-boys club and now that
they're starting to close the binary

252
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.400
gender gap the boys feel pushed out of
what they thought of as their space in a

253
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.640
way that lara croft did not make them
feel threatened because she was a sex

254
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.480
icon where samus was kinda
well

255
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.880
she was literally just
one of the boys until her reveal and

256
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.880
honestly ripping off her helmet to
reveal a full blowout after hours of

257
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.830
explosions and space monsters is one
hell of a serve

258
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.269
[Music]
[Applause]

259
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.440
i mean again the fact that director
yoshio sakamoto needed to basically

260
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.559
trick gamers into fighting aliens while
secretly playing as a woman is

261
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:35.360
not fantastic especially because many
gamers have since become even more

262
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.039
allergic to women in gaming
which is very disheartening what's

263
00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:42.240
concerning about gaming as a whole is
that games with female protagonists

264
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.400
equally seem to not enjoy using women as
ciphers instead with most of them

265
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.799
propping up a soapbox to either
textually or subtextually discuss their

266
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:54.640
validity as a woman in the central role
and this becomes more true as studios

267
00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.080
spend more money on said game unless
you're a core metroid game then it's

268
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.919
just all the badass stuff the boys are
doing but with a pronoun reskin funny

269
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:07.600
that i mentioned pronouns actually
because early nintendo dipped its foot

270
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.960
into the gender puddle long before
gamergate bros were old enough to put

271
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.720
together words let alone open up the
trans debate for those in the know you

272
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.919
know what's coming birdo is a mess and
we can look at it as a good mess or a

273
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:24.720
bad mess but either way the character
isn't a hot mess because nintendo

274
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.160
doesn't really seem to be uncomfortable
with continued inclusion of the

275
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.080
character and ongoing content if you've
gone through any nintendo history videos

276
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.400
then you know that birdo was originally
introduced as a mob enemy in super mario

277
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.080
bros 2
which was originally developed as yumi

278
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.000
kojo doki doki panic but then reskinned
into a sequel to super mario brothers

279
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.160
because they thought the real sequel was
too hard for american gamers which

280
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.320
it's basically the dark souls of mario
games which in contrast to the prior

281
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.760
mario installment also featured princess
peach as a playable character so more

282
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.039
fem rep from early nintendo going
through the game there was no real

283
00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:05.760
indication about birdo's queerness she
had a bow on her head a pixelated bow if

284
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.520
you can pick it out i suppose the
implication was that you were supposed

285
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.919
to automatically think of birdo as she
her while playing and if you went on to

286
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:17.760
read the instruction manual you'd see
the description for the character quote

287
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.400
he thinks he is a girl okay we're off to
a not great start but

288
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.360
like 1980s he thinks he is a girl he
spits eggs from his mouth he would

289
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.520
rather be called birdetta well great job
nintendo you're dead naming your own

290
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.360
trans character
great start nintendo creative never did

291
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.400
go ahead with bradetta probably more to
do with branding and copyright but they

292
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.159
did begin using exclusively feminine
pronouns in their english material the

293
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:48.159
gender thing has never since been
addressed with birdo though so even

294
00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:51.919
though she decided not to change her
name i'm very glad that everyone in the

295
00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:55.600
mushroom kingdom respects her transition
the mindset in the 80s was more likely

296
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.919
that birdo's alleged gender confusion
was seen as a great way to contribute to

297
00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:03.840
the wacky zany vibes that made up early
mario games i don't really think there

298
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.120
was any intended statement about making
a trans character a villain the heroic

299
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.640
cast was primarily composed of italians
and mushroom people so i think that this

300
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.799
was meant more to represent the kind of
antics that you would expect from the

301
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:20.720
world as a whole but it is interesting
to know that in spite of the hot button

302
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.200
gender identity nintendo was interested
in keeping this character around instead

303
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.799
of continuing on with the gender
confusion angle they simplified it to

304
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:32.320
she her and brought out the visual
elements to better accommodate ongoing

305
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.559
mario vibes now when it comes to modern
birdo

306
00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:41.520
did they keep her on queerly or are they
cis-washing an otherwise queer character

307
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.919
my money's on the former if they wanted
her to not exist they could pull at

308
00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:48.880
disney and refuse to acknowledge her
existence while doing their best to wipe

309
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.480
her from history the decision to keep
her in the cast indicates that they are

310
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.559
validating her girly thoughts referenced
in the manual either way you'd have to

311
00:21:56.559 --> 00:22:00.640
admit that this is an instance of aaa
gaming learning from cultural feedback

312
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.720
and adapting to responses which is
wild but

313
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.679
stranger things have happened but
as time goes on and representation

314
00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:12.799
becomes more and more of a visible
conversation

315
00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:16.700
nintendo's right there with us
being weird about it

316
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:25.120
[Music]
in this modern day of throwing around

317
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.400
the word agenda
at any available opportunity it's tough

318
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.280
to say what nintendo's agenda is when it
comes to representation and meanwhile

319
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.520
now that i said it i'd like to know
exactly how agenda came to receive such

320
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.760
a negative tone having an agenda just
means you have a collection of

321
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.000
appointments and schedule dates
the implication in reference to the gay

322
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.880
agenda is that there is some end goal in
mind and so when queer folks dismiss the

323
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.559
idea of having an agenda
i get confused

324
00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:00.240
because you know
the road to rights does take a lot of

325
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.840
political planning in order to pass
various hurdles and milestones maybe if

326
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.440
we had an agenda things would be going a
bit smoother for our american queer

327
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.600
siblings than it is maybe the agenda
ended with marriage and since then queer

328
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.039
organizations have been running around
like headless chickens acting reactively

329
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:20.720
to bigoted countermeasures maybe we got
bullied out of having an agenda and

330
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.720
since then queer circles have been
lacking for any organizational skills

331
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.200
whatsoever because when you don't have a
gay agenda you end up looking a lot like

332
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.799
nintendo's take on gender and sexuality
in their post-wii era of game

333
00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:37.360
development which at times kind of feels
like they're throwing every opinion they

334
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.000
can muster onto a dartboard like
nintendo doesn't really miss the mark

335
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.559
entirely but at the same time it's not
fantastic either which on one hand the

336
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:50.000
lack of gender spectacle is kind of what
queer audiences are looking for but on

337
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
the other hand
there's this ambiguous laziness that

338
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.840
kind of triggers the need to overanalyze
that a lot of us have starting with the

339
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.600
bad we have nintendo's infamous
weirdness when it came to tomodachi life

340
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.320
tomodachi life was the second
installment in a social simulation

341
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.720
franchise made by nintendo the first
tamadachi collection was a japan only

342
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.799
release and when the sequel was
announced for the 3ds the distinct lack

343
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:17.039
of an option to engage in same-gender
relationships was immediately brought to

344
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:20.960
the front this was an issue provided
that other life sims had already made

345
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.559
same gender relations an easily
available option with the sims kind of

346
00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:27.919
setting the standard nintendo's first
response was that they based this new

347
00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:31.440
game on code from the original and that
it would be too difficult to release a

348
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.400
patch to change it
which

349
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.200
given that dlc even in those days was
more or less a patch to an existing game

350
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.760
i don't know what the fuss was about in
this way at least you can say that

351
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.919
tomodachi life is a mirror to our social
structures for how

352
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:52.400
bizarrely deep heteronormativity is
encoded into our society's expectations

353
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.919
that you can't just patch the game so
that little fake digital people have the

354
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:59.600
same social interactions with he him
avatars as they do with she her post

355
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.200
release and following negative reception
and negative press to the mechanic

356
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.279
nintendo released the statement
we never intended to make any form of

357
00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:10.000
social commentary with the launch of the
game

358
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.200
which i don't know who approved that
statement

359
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.840
but that just makes it a whole lot worse
to me don't you love when your life is

360
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.400
automatically social commentary i'm so
exhausted

361
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.600
from being a social commentary i guess
this whole channel is just social

362
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.720
commentary making a social commentary of
media which is in and of itself a social

363
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.679
commentary i guess we're all just social
commentaries

364
00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:37.679
new gender identity nintendo did say
that if they were to make a third

365
00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:42.159
installment of the game they would
strive to design a gameplay experience

366
00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:46.880
from the ground up that is more
inclusive etc etc etc yeah well

367
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.799
they haven't made the third game so in
reality this controversy likely arose

368
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.120
from the game's presence in japan where
the game is marketed as an all ages

369
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.960
social sim and where japanese censorship
laws prohibit queerness at least

370
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.760
same-sex relations from being in all
ages content gay and lesbian romances

371
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.440
and personality types are something that
nintendo has flirted with in the past

372
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.159
and present albeit indirectly most
commonly in their most prolific

373
00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:16.400
narrative series the legend of zelda
barring the strong indication that

374
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.840
several if not all versions or
reincarnations of link across the

375
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.000
franchise are gay or bisexual no i will
not be taking questions there are other

376
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.760
queer elements in the franchise that
being said a queer link is something

377
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.840
that is impossible to find conclusive
evidence of nintendo has made staunch

378
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.159
work to assure that link is a voiceless
cipher for the player very little beyond

379
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:40.880
the bare minimum of each game is done to
facilitate any personality for link link

380
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.440
is meant to be the connection that the
audience has to high rule itself so the

381
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.440
less personality the better because it
allows the player to feel like they are

382
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.000
experiencing the world rather than
observing someone else experiencing the

383
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.679
world which neither is necessarily
better than the other but link is

384
00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:01.679
usually handled exceptionally well some
of you may notice that the zelda games

385
00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:05.120
that are best received are the ones
where link has less of a personal

386
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.559
involvement in the game itself both
twilight princess and skyward swords

387
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:13.440
suffer from this and while each has its
fanbase audiences at large had trouble

388
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.679
connecting with them in both cases the
game struggled with an eluded romantic

389
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:22.799
interest for link so a player may feel
uncomfortable not knowing to what extent

390
00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:26.399
they were witness to the actions of a
character and what nintendo was telling

391
00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:29.880
them they ought to do one may say
there's a problem with forced

392
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.000
heterosexuality depicted in these titles
link himself as a result is frequently

393
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.320
subject to any number of ships
specifically in games where

394
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.799
you know
nintendo doesn't try to force him into a

395
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:44.960
hetero corner most notably prince cydon
from breath of the wild comes to mind

396
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.960
which itself features in-game
interactions that maybe even dive into

397
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.799
queerbaiting not to say that breath of
the wild doesn't also suffer from some

398
00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:56.640
very
forced heterosexuality issues of its own

399
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.320
they had all the chemistry of oil and
water and yet she wanted to get married

400
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.039
also not the only time link had been
forcibly pushed into a marriage

401
00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:06.640
engagement with a fish woman meanwhile
is no mystery why the fish boy with the

402
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.640
transatlantic accent is the only one he
had any meaningful physical contact with

403
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.799
quick link tenderly embraced me
to save the world of course but now

404
00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:18.000
we're getting into the territory of
reading into things and the straight

405
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.919
people hate it when we do that but it's
fine when they do it

406
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:27.600
don't worry about it but once again
it is much more clear that sidon is more

407
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.080
attracted to link than link is to him
which while the main character is rarely

408
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.360
depicted with romantic chemistry
nintendo does shyly include queer

409
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.200
illusions sometimes accidentally
stepping into trans ones in ocarina of

410
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.520
time zelda disguises herself and hides
in plain sight as sheik a shika agent

411
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.919
who guides link through hyrule who
presents as a man

412
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:53.279
and while this was quote just a disguise
sheik has been adopted by queer elements

413
00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.880
of the zelda fandom regardless the
titular character of zelda herself is a

414
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.320
bit of a mixed bag of a mixed bag when
it comes to gender expression it seems

415
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.159
as far as a pattern goes that zelda
becomes less capable the more frills her

416
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:09.279
skirts have her role ranges from badass
to damsel often being both in the same

417
00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:12.640
game like with ocarina of time the
second she puts on a dress and she just

418
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.720
gets snatched up same thing with wind
waker that said this franchise is weird

419
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.279
in general when it comes to women and
capability for instance the gerudo a

420
00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:25.440
desert fairing race exclusively made up
of women were introduced in ocarina of

421
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.679
time but have become a franchise staple
these independent ladies who featured in

422
00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:34.559
many zelda games since either as neutral
npcs or antagonists have a staunch

423
00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:38.960
warrior vibe and regularly carry weapons
in these sections of the game link is

424
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.720
forced to use stealth and go unnoticed
presumably because link though a

425
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.279
competent warrior cannot face the full
force of these women in open combat

426
00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:50.799
gerudo culture in the game focuses
around leaving the desert to find

427
00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:54.480
husbands in spite of the fact that this
is a whole race of ladies with abs

428
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.960
thighs legs and back muscles there is an
in-game cultural obsession with finding

429
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.720
a husband there's a nighttime classroom
in the settlement dedicated to teaching

430
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.520
young ladies how to snag a man the
deceased leader herbosa is lightly

431
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.000
inferred to be a lesbian but the best
reference we have to same-sex relations

432
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.080
in the body of the gerudo population is
that some ladies simply have no interest

433
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.720
in finding a husband and while breath of
the wild freely engages in a widespread

434
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.279
commentary about monogamous heterosexual
romantic dynamics of hyrule we are

435
00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:29.360
reminded that same gender attraction is
a commentary nintendo is not willing to

436
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.080
get into in fact any illusion about
lesbian relations among the gerudo are

437
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.360
so scant
that i can't even call it queerbaiting

438
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.279
y'all know by now i'll say anything is
queerbaited but i should give nintendo

439
00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:44.399
some credit for filling out my favorite
trope of all time

440
00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:49.120
the incredibly handyman who is also
effeminate as fine

441
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.240
which abundantly femme construction
workers

442
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.640
is also a staple of 3d zelda games is he
you know and really all of this wouldn't

443
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.200
be as much of a problem
if it weren't for the growing trend of

444
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.760
video games to become more dynamic and
complex on a social level even tots

445
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.840
these days are becoming freakishly
culturally literate so games require a

446
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.080
greater exploration of personality types
to flush out npcs some of these

447
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.440
personality types just so happen to be
queer

448
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.200
and let's face it
we're hilarious it really sucks the

449
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.880
queer bigotry exists because this whole
damn community is right for roasting

450
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.159
there's a reason so many gay directors
make bad comedies about us but is that

451
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:34.240
what queerness is to this franchise a
punchline

452
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.440
i would agree if effeminate men and
masculine women were played exclusively

453
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.559
for laughs or if there was an element of
mockery

454
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:45.519
however neither link nor anyone else
respond to these characters negatively

455
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:50.159
everyone in this world kind of
goes along with everyone else

456
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:54.320
it's a non-issue
and like bolson and his twink and bolson

457
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.120
and the other construction workers their
prancing femininity doesn't really

458
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.799
interfere with their ability to work
while there can be an argument made

459
00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:06.640
about the gerudo being gender critical
exclusionary gatekeepers

460
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.799
they do permit gorons who have no gender
to enter the village and at the end of

461
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:14.960
the day in spite of the guards posted
outside groto village nobody's checking

462
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.000
anyone else's pants for entrance into
otherwise fem exclusive spaces and once

463
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.200
link's inside nobody really questions it
even though there are some raised

464
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.640
eyebrows around town so in spite of the
fact that he's slightly clockable

465
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.399
nobody cares
nobody be like the gerudo

466
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:35.519
and just
get on with your life in fact for the

467
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:39.840
zelda franchise as a whole as much as i
can't really celebrate it for being woke

468
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.159
it doesn't seem to be doing anything
explicitly wrong either maybe little

469
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:49.279
nitpicky things sure but broad strokes
it's staggeringly neutral which i have

470
00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:53.679
it on good authority that those who are
queer of gender sometimes really

471
00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:58.559
relish in the opportunity to not think
about gender and gender dynamics in some

472
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:01.120
ways
this is very much nintendo's philosophy

473
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.320
for games they produce kind of pay no
attention to the gender behind the

474
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.679
curtain while at the same time they also
seem to like distributing games

475
00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:15.600
where gender expression is at the very
center of the attention

476
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:22.559
[Music]
pokemon is generally considered an old

477
00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:26.640
franchise even though it was first
released in 1996 while early on you were

478
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.159
forced to play as a boy later games
allowed you to pick either a boy or a

479
00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:33.840
girl to play as which has carried on
through future installments though this

480
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.360
seems like a simple choice a little
binary given that gender restricts what

481
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.960
clothes you can wear in the most recent
games pokemon has plenty more weirdness

482
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.919
when it comes to gender a pokemon's
gender never really mattered in the

483
00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:47.519
games until the breeding mechanic was
introduced which cue the torrent of

484
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.519
grown-ass gay pokemon fans snickering to
themselves first of all gender is

485
00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:54.799
probably uh
not the best term to use for discussing

486
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:59.360
procreation but this is also a world
where inter-species breeding has its

487
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.840
advantages we're already off the rails
so why not just dive in various pokemon

488
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.919
have separate evolutions depending upon
their gender but also some pokemon with

489
00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:13.040
distinctly feminine or masculine traits
are exclusively female or male however

490
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.000
there are some curious exceptions namely
the ralts family rods can be male or

491
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.280
female at a 50 rate first of all ralts
has a white robe in its first stage very

492
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.440
non-gendered but evolves into corellia
by default corellia evolves into

493
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.839
gardevoir male or female who is probably
one of the most rule 34 pokemon out

494
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:35.359
there however
ralts has another third stage evolution

495
00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:40.000
which is only available to male coreleas
the ballet inspired effeminate dancing

496
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.399
psychic and later psychic fairy dual
type can be exposed to hrt i mean the

497
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:49.119
dawn stone and evolve into the psychic
fighting type glade

498
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:53.040
significantly more masculine and there's
a flip side to this too a female snow

499
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.960
runt will evolve into a frost last when
exposed to a dust stone otherwise male

500
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.800
or female will evolve into glaily you
know to mirror the evolution progress of

501
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.480
ralts game freak the producer of core
pokemon games as a subsidiary of

502
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.800
nintendo has been a bit more nonchalant
about sneaking in adult humor and

503
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.079
references into their games
you know the kind of stuff that goes

504
00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:16.240
over the kids heads kind of like
sesame street from the 80s and early 90s

505
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.920
but game freak also likes to toss in a
queer nod every once in a while and

506
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.240
unlike parent company nintendo it's a
little less ambiguous as long as you

507
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.280
know what's what like in pokemon xy's
random battle manor you may come across

508
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.240
a beauty trainer who says yes a mere
half year ago i was a black belt

509
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.680
quite the transformation wouldn't you
say and it should be highlighted that

510
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.079
beauty is a title for trainers that are
exclusively women and that black belts

511
00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:45.760
are titles that apply exclusively to
male trainers this is also to say

512
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.079
nothing of game freak's habit of
throwing on very cute little young love

513
00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:53.440
overtones when it comes to scripting
your character's rival regardless of

514
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.760
gender including a very strong allusion
to the principal characters of red and

515
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.280
blue being a traveling pokemon duo who
just

516
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.280
may be more than friends and trainers
but unlike our beauty queen this is a

517
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.760
little bit too subtle to be visible
representation even though chatty boy

518
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.599
and quiet boy are kind of an archetypal
gay couple but given all the other

519
00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:19.280
evidence it seems like game freak's
heart is in the right place someday they

520
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.160
will kiss
and i will live to see it this is also

521
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.599
in conjunction with the fact that some
pokemon just don't have a gender

522
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:30.480
especially the legendary types like mew
so hear this my non-binary genderqueer

523
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.520
friends as far as pokemon is concerned
you are legendary and while it may have

524
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.200
taken a while parent company nintendo
has caught up to this meh approach of

525
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.880
gender identity for playable characters
both splatoon 2 at least and animal

526
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.520
crossing's new horizon allow players to
swap genders willy-nilly and with no

527
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.800
discernible change to body type or
clothing availability especially with

528
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.640
new horizons there isn't really a limit
to mismatching otherwise traditionally

529
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.839
gendered clothing realistically
everything is kind of urban in unisex

530
00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:03.280
and splatoon anyway where really the
only difference is available hairstyles

531
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.560
do you identify as a fade or a ponytail
now what's fun about this is while

532
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.160
nintendo is widely known for being
squeaky clean provider of all ages

533
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.839
electronic entertainment they've started
to dip their toes into stuff that's a

534
00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:18.810
little more
exciting

535
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.640
[Music]
in stark contrast to the wholesome pay

536
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:28.240
it no mind genderlessness of splatoon
and animal crossing nintendo also owns

537
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.359
by proxy of sega and platinum games
bayonetta all right nintendo doesn't own

538
00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:37.200
it but there is an exclusivity agreement
maybe nintendo wanted a high octane

539
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.720
action game to help move the floundering
wii u off shelves

540
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.880
maybe they wanted to get back in touch
with their sensual love hotel side

541
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.800
maybe they wanted counter programming to
their regular content who knows because

542
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.839
if they wanted to present an m rated
title they could have gone with

543
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:57.599
something far less extra bayonetta is
about the horniest campiest game you can

544
00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:01.920
possibly find from anything anywhere
near a triple-a title yeah devil may cry

545
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.760
comes close but bayonetta is queer
culture and i don't mean that

546
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.200
figuratively the in-lore magical dance
moves is voguing a dance style developed

547
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.040
within queer circles and on the streets
of queer heavy urban centers voice

548
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.119
delivery and animation is straight out
of a drag performance it's not christmas

549
00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:23.839
without caviar and it's all done so
shamelessly clear

550
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:27.520
that i still get a little shooketh when
i see straight gamers on twitter

551
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.440
insisting that this is all done for the
male gays honey

552
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.720
the kind of males this game is made for
are the gays but whatever understanding

553
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.560
your media your way is your prerogative
i'm not saying that all bayonetta fans

554
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.040
are gay
but

555
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.560
there is a pattern
and it's there for a reason bayonetta

556
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.720
exists in stark contrast to metroid in
that samus is powerful in spite of her

557
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.599
gender mowing down aliens with a power
suit is kind of a unisex look whereas

558
00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:02.400
the power of umbra witches seems to be
drawn from their gender or rather from

559
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.800
their expression of gender they vogue to
open up portals to hell and use magical

560
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.880
hair extensions to literally bind a
demon and puppet them into munching down

561
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.760
hordes of angels this is also probably
the most faithful depiction of

562
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.599
biblically accurate angels in any form
of major media to date now my take on

563
00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:22.240
voguing is that opposed to dance forms
like ballet where the focus is upon

564
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.960
grace and finesse vogue's focus is on
power actions that are otherwise supple

565
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:32.640
and delicate are exaggerated to grand
flourishes femininity is the highlight

566
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.320
but a performance of vogue that is
understated isn't going to win the crowd

567
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.599
or the judges unshakable regal authority
is the objective be someone who cannot

568
00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:45.200
be pushed off the stage it's very
interesting that bayonetta takes that

569
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.599
principle and applies it to hellish
summons to witchcraft for which men in

570
00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:53.440
history have used that accusation to
take power away from women whereas in

571
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.520
the lore of bayonetta when
wrenching these kinds of monsters out of

572
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.800
hell it's a fun extra layer of lore that
a single flinch or yielding one's

573
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.520
queenish authority
could lose control of the summon however

574
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.160
next to nintendo's whole library this is
just one title which

575
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.880
definitely earns its hard m rating not
just the violence but as witch clothing

576
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.040
is made out of their own hair which they
also use to summon monsters you spend

577
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.800
about 20 percent of the game tits out
there are also a significant number of

578
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.280
nintendo titles that i haven't played or
that i haven't played in some time i

579
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.640
hear fire emblem has some touch and go
representation although i'm intrigued by

580
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.839
the fabulous outfits and beautiful anime
boys and honestly when it comes to

581
00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:40.880
captain toad or kirby i can't imagine
gender discourse is front and center

582
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.480
there so as always you're free to
discuss in the comments below

583
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.720
[Music]
now the problem with assessing nintendo

584
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.000
for its take on gender and sexuality is
that

585
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.240
it's barely a take to begin with outside
of tomodachi life which they addressed

586
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.160
in a statement as being a bad move
nintendo doesn't really have any strong

587
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.319
inclination one way or another peach has
a female empowerment moment in odyssey

588
00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:12.079
which is fine but giving a girl boss
moment to otherwise stalk female

589
00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:17.119
characters has kind of already been done
gender and sexual identity in nintendo

590
00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:23.119
games are so low presentation that it's
really hard to celebrate or criticize

591
00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:27.680
them which honestly is fascinating that
they're managing to stay so middle of

592
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.839
the road in this day and age when
every executive is expected to have a

593
00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:35.280
canned response about queer issues and
while everyone's looking to disney for a

594
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.520
whopping 12 seconds of queer
representation in doctor strange and

595
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.839
while ea is under a magnifying glass for
equal opportunity queer romance options

596
00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:47.040
nintendo
is escaping a lot of the scrutiny could

597
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.800
it be that disney is simply held up on a
pedestal for laying the psychosexual

598
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.240
foundation for little tots and children
defining for them what their romantic

599
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.520
expectations are as they grow up as a
monopoly and that ea and their

600
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.040
contemporaries are explicitly going out
of their way to build their games like a

601
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.720
paint by numbers canvas for which the
simple omission of a particular color

602
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.200
would stand out by contrast the extent
of nintendo's gender and sexuality

603
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.119
conditioning usually begins and ends at
mario getting a kiss on the cheek from

604
00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:17.760
peach so queer rep doesn't really feel
particularly absent

605
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.720
because cishet rep is also lacking
gender discourse isn't really necessary

606
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.319
for creating the kind of gaming
experiences nintendo is trying to give

607
00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:29.839
the player in many cases it seems
nintendo is trying to generate worlds

608
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:33.599
where the player brings with them their
own experiences and expectations but

609
00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:38.240
what i can't really decide is whether
nintendo's approach is good

610
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.560
or bad certainly nintendo creates an
environment where cultures and social

611
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.960
leanings are player developed the best
example of this is in splatoon where

612
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.200
players can generate messages and images
to project other players frequently the

613
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.040
game is host to a trend of proudly
proclaiming one's identity as a queer

614
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.520
person and or furry and nintendo doesn't
seem inclined to remove these images

615
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.079
while they do remove bigotry bigots
can't find a place to feel at home in

616
00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:08.079
inkopolis so the player base can
superimpose queerness into the otherwise

617
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:12.000
absent culture of the game whereas the
textual depiction of the game is

618
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.680
characteristically mostly neutral the
principal exception are splatoon 2's

619
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.520
hosts pearl and marina who are
girlfriends in everything but name i

620
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.440
would call this baiting except that this
eluded lesbian couple is the closest

621
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.319
thing that the splatoon franchise has to
any kind of relationship it's just not a

622
00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:32.560
part of the game's atmosphere so i
really don't know how to qualify that

623
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.880
queer rep is something that nintendo's
content never really promised but as

624
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.280
games become more dynamic there is
naturally going to be a call

625
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.000
for a greater range of identities going
forward for instance npcs and zelda

626
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.920
games will get stale if they can't
switch up the kinds of interactions you

627
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.599
can have that said in spite of
nintendo's avoidance of starting a

628
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:57.520
gender discourse
they really don't shy away from it while

629
00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.599
no character has ever really gone out of
their way to explain to link that they

630
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:05.839
them pronouns are plausible in hyrule
nintendo certainly doesn't mind playing

631
00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:10.319
npc characters against type queerness is
displayed

632
00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:15.280
but it's not explained or justified
which to a cultural benefit

633
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.720
nintendo still does direct its games
primarily at a youth audience

634
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.960
maybe not it's subsidiaries but
nintendo proper because the next

635
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.119
generation of gamers will play these
games and spot the internal cultural

636
00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:32.800
acceptance of suggested queerness which
means that they have queerness

637
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.880
associated with a positive experience in
a virtual world which establishes a

638
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.760
channel of influence for this young
gamer to also approach queerness this

639
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.760
way in real life that being
gender is only a big deal if the

640
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.079
individual wants it to be in which case
it's really not worth getting up in arms

641
00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:55.359
over queer people like bird people octo
people and mushroom people simply

642
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.079
are
the alternative which we normally see in

643
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:02.640
gaming is a grand spectacle about gender
and sexual identity being represented

644
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.319
going hand in hand with the marketing
campaign to let gaming news and everyone

645
00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:09.760
who reads it know
who's going to be seen in an upcoming

646
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.520
title and maybe there is some benefit to
that but from everything i've seen

647
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.359
propping up a queer character on a
pedestal does little to convince bigots

648
00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:21.599
to come around to allyship especially in
m rated titles you're dealing with an

649
00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:25.440
audience who are not likely on the fence
about the topic at that point but how

650
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.680
can you quantify
and measure a transgenerational

651
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.160
reduction in homophobia specifically as
a result of a couple of prominent if not

652
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.920
entirely obvious gay lumberjacks in
breath of the wild it's so much easier

653
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.400
for queer media to quantify the effect
that an anti-bigotry plotline has in an

654
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.640
rpg when it comes to the gender as
aesthetic approaches and splatoon and

655
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.319
animal crossing which allow players to
swap at any given time

656
00:45:50.319 --> 00:45:54.880
can we really understand at this time
what an impact that will have on the

657
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.839
next generation of trans or non-binary
teenagers or allies again i feel that

658
00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:04.560
queer bigotry exists less among
individuals who are raised in situations

659
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.400
where queerness itself is unremarkable
and though we have no specific

660
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.160
representation from nintendo either
deliberately or inadvertently this is

661
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.079
the kind of mindset around gender that
nintendo seems to be projecting this

662
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:20.640
process establishes a normative
environment where playing with gender

663
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.000
and gender expression is both possible
and entirely irrelevant to your gaming

664
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.640
experience
to which the youngins may ask themselves

665
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.000
if it's possible virtually
why not in real life why does my gender

666
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.920
expression need to be such a big deal in
real life when it's not in a nintendo

667
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.599
game and to those who may grow up and be
indoctrinated into a bigoted mindset

668
00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:49.119
nintendo opening a game by saying that
it's possible to switch your gender

669
00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:53.280
whenever you like and that it has no
effect on gameplay

670
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.160
may normalize the idea of gender
non-conformity which

671
00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.520
now we're getting into the wild wild
world of bigotry and gaming which is a

672
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.880
rabbit hole that doesn't ever stop once
you jump in given that there is a new

673
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.240
wave of bigots using
child grooming

674
00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.079
as a publicly acceptable shield to
disguise their bigotry

675
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:17.599
nintendo being the child-friendly gaming
studio would no doubt come under fire if

676
00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:22.319
they made gender and sexuality any more
overt than they already do and that

677
00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:26.480
seems like a controversy the company
does not want to deal with i wouldn't be

678
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.400
surprised if the developers feel like
they have to walk on eggshells their

679
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.200
existing fandom already seems to dangle
by a thread every other nintendo direct

680
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.440
and army of fans take to social media to
decry the company for not dropping any

681
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.760
announcements for their personally
anticipated game part of me is glad that

682
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.599
smash brothers post release content on
the switch is slowed down because now

683
00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:51.200
people can stop
being upset that master chief isn't the

684
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.559
next smash fighter a widespread assault
from

685
00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:58.880
definitely not homophobic parents would
not likely tank the company since

686
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.160
nintendo has cash reserves that could
see them lose money for decades without

687
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.280
going under but it would put a stress on
the creative side of game making and as

688
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.640
a creator i can say my creative process
becomes a whole lot less fun the more

689
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.880
restrictive it is big shout out to my
patrons by the way thank you and when

690
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.800
things aren't fun to make
they're not fun to experience so i

691
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.880
understand that politically nintendo is
in a sticky spot

692
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.000
as per censorship regulations existing
audiences concerned parents and gaming

693
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.440
toxicity as a whole that said
you can't shake a stick in a gay bar

694
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.200
without whacking a muscle bear with a
tattoo of jigglypuff or kirby the gays

695
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.119
have put out for nintendo and friends
and even if we're not explicitly

696
00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:47.440
depicted
we aren't shunted and rejected either in

697
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.079
real life
you can't just go around asking people

698
00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:55.520
about their birth gender or at least
you shouldn't so it would be wrong for

699
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.760
nintendo to establish that precedence if
birdo's not the kind of trans lady who

700
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.640
likes to bring up her gendered
experiences

701
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.440
then
she's just not that kind of girl and

702
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.960
that's fine in real queer communities
especially in north america we're

703
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.440
engaged in a hearty debate about needing
real-life queer icons

704
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.440
while
also

705
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.599
claiming that it is important to come
out on one's own terms so celebrities

706
00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:23.359
face enormous pressure to come out in
spite of the possibility that their

707
00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:28.720
careers may be destroyed
which despite what you think

708
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.400
it's still a very real possibility but a
lot of us seem not to care about that

709
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.480
and care more about needing the icon of
a queer celeb because while we talk

710
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.760
about the need for visibility we risk
pigeonholing ourselves into a mindset

711
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.400
where we treat people as symbols or
icons and yes that even includes

712
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.480
fictional people who often serve as
models of available options for how we

713
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.920
can live our lives
treating people as symbols to signify

714
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:59.359
certain identities may not be sexual but
it is nevertheless an objectification of

715
00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:03.680
someone that is reducing someone's
personhood to being an object with a

716
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:09.440
specific purpose and intention rather
than honoring their right to exist as a

717
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.440
person

718
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:19.119
[Music]
weirdly enough i find that nintendo may

719
00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:23.599
very well be the first major studio of
media providers to give us regular

720
00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:28.079
consistent queerness if not explicit
queer representation not because they

721
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:32.880
particularly have an agenda to do so
but that nintendo knows how to shift

722
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.720
when culture shifts that's how they've
kept themselves around for so long these

723
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.079
are developers who have been working in
creative fields since the 80s rather

724
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:44.079
than executives who are trying to sell
you loot boxes reflecting culture seems

725
00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:48.480
to be an integral component of creation
and i find creators want to express

726
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.839
their view of society and their work and
really when you think about it nintendo

727
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:56.640
has been normalizing non-typical gender
expression for almost 40 years

728
00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.960
from samus being their most badass space
marine to link being more than a little

729
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.960
comfortable in gerudo drag they've never
been shy about subverting your

730
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.960
expectations when it comes to gender and
though they avoid stating the sexuality

731
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.359
of almost any of their characters
maybe that's okay you don't get a lot of

732
00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:19.359
gay romance options in nintendo games
but you don't get a whole hell of a lot

733
00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:23.520
of straight ones either in many cases
the heterosexuality is just as inferred

734
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.960
as the homosexuality we read the
straightness into their games because

735
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.440
that's the default we've grown up with
we assume link and zelda are an item

736
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.119
even though the vast majority of the
games do not show them that way we

737
00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:39.920
assume mario and peach are together if
not married but the most loving mario

738
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.599
ever gets from peach is a kiss on the
cheek who knows maybe she's got her own

739
00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:47.040
princess in another castle if nothing
else at a time when the queer community

740
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.200
is being demonized by major figures in
politics trying to reinforce cisgender

741
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.559
heterosexuality as the only acceptable
game mode

742
00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:58.880
nintendo games almost seem like a breath
of fresh air because they're not shoving

743
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.599
their binary gender heterosexuality in
our faces it's kind of a safe space for

744
00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:08.079
the people who don't fit the default
mode and i think that might be enough

745
00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:10.960
nintendo isn't trying to be the gayest
company in the world

746
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.400
but they're not trying to let the bigots
save face

747
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.559
like that other company that's known for
producing formative media

748
00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:22.319
plus nintendo switch was the first
console to release hades and if that

749
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:26.240
isn't an ally move i don't know what is
and nintendo games give me a bit of hope

750
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.119
in an odd way
like in breath of the wild

751
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:33.200
the kingdom fell to the destructive
hatred of the calamity but it didn't

752
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.400
last forever
people of all sorts of different genders

753
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.319
and races and sexualities yes i'm
counting sidon come together to fight

754
00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:44.880
back the darkness and they won
and so will we

755
00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.800
we just have to stick together focus our
energy and fight

756
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.520
when we do that

757
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:40.070
nothing can stand in our way
