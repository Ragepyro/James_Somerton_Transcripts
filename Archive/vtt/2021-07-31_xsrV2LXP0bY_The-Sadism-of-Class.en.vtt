00:00:14.940 --> 00:01:11.260
SO, Back to the increasingly popular world
of Korean Manhwa we go!

2
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.150
After the Killing Stalking video came out
in April, I got, literally, thousands of messages

3
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.620
and comments from people telling me that I
definitely needed to read Painter of the Night.

4
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.800
That it was a lot like Killing Stalking, especially
in its use of sexual abuse as a plot point. 

5
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.040
Though I was a little worried that a lot of
people on the internet now thought of me as

6
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.010
the guy who talks about disturbing Korean
media, I eventually gave in and checked it

7
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:45.070
out. And… I really had no idea what people
were talking about. I didn't find it anywhere

8
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.640
near as disturbing as Killing Stalking. I
think because Painter of the Night is a period

9
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.960
piece, set about 200 years ago during the
Joseon Dynastic period in Korea. 

10
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.650
And because it was set two hundred years ago,
and I’m a fan of history, I wasn't really

11
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.110
all that shocked at some of the things I was
seeing. Blackmail, r*pe, murder… Not exactly

12
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.470
unheard of at a time when America was being
built off of the backs of African slaves,

13
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.560
and England was subjugating more non-white
people across the world than any super power

14
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
before them. 

15
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.960
I was particularly un-shocked because the
people doing the blackmailing, r*ping, and

16
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.920
murdering were, for the most part, rich. The
elite of Korea. Who could get away with pretty

17
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.030
much anything because they had money and influence.
I thought, of course people are being abused

18
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.620
by the rich. That’s just how it goes.

19
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.570
And then I realized something about myself
that was pretty depressing. In the year of

20
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.390
our lord, 2021, I have become so used to seeing
the rich do terrible things and get away with

21
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.450
it, that it had become so commonplace in my
mind, that i wasn't the least bit shocked

22
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.910
when it was taken to the poetic degree of
the poor literally being r*ped by the rich,

23
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.300
instead of figuratively r*ped by them. 

24
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.770
I had become so jaded by the economic horrors
of our current situation that seeing them

25
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.420
on a page had little effect on me. 

26
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.540
And don't get me wrong, the content in this
comic is still disturbing. The abuse and gaslighting

27
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.080
is extreme, even from characters who aren't
technically villains. And, of course, it wouldn’t

28
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.790
be the number one manwha on the internet if
there wasnt some sexual assault thrown in

29
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.460
there as well. Like, in every issue. A lot
of sex. To the point where some of the original

30
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.940
working titles for the series, from the author
herself, were “Painter of Sex” and “Pornography:

31
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.410
A Scandal in Joseon”.

32
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.040
So lots of sex and sexual abuse, lots of emotional
manipulation and abuse. And the rich abusing

33
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:52.849
the poor in every which way possible. I guess
this is my brand now. Let’s discuss. 

34
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.819
Painter of the Night is a story set in historic
Korea. It follows the titular painter, Nakyum,

35
00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.959
as he is more or less abducted by a nobleman,
Yoon Seungho, who has been largely estranged

36
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.239
from his family due to having a reputation
for being a bit too horny. Nakyum is a talented

37
00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.099
painter who had been unable to find a patron
to support his work, and so he’s resorted

38
00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.030
to painting erotic depictions of sodomy to
make ends meet.

39
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.750
Which is basically how digital artists function
today. Nakyum would have struck it rich if

40
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.720
he got commissioned by some furries.

41
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.430
Seungho is totally into it. And in spite of
Nakyum using a pseudonym to sell collections

42
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.720
of his naughty pictures, Seungho manages to
track him down. But when he does, Nakyum is

43
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.400
living as a drunk, and has all but given up
erotic painting for mysterious reasons. Unfortunately

44
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.840
for Nakyum, the nobleman doesn’t take ‘no’
for an answer.

45
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.680
And one thing leads to another and then There’s
the little Twink, painting pictures of Seungho

46
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.630
boning other dudes. While it takes some time
for Seungho to turn his sexual appetites to

47
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.670
his prisoner-slash-beneficiary, it does happen,
and it’s… absolutely not consensual. At

48
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.900
least not at first. It goes on for a while,
sometimes with Seungho getting explicitly

49
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.850
violent, and then Nakyum eventually doing
it “willingly” just to avoid Seungho’s

50
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.850
temper.

51
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.190
See. Seungho is the eldest child of the Yoon
Family, which, historically, has been of great

52
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.800
significance and influence. However, over
the prior few generations, the family’s

53
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.710
prestige has been waning, and their political
influence is dwindling. Culminating in Seungho

54
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.300
living the high life, riding out what’s
left of his family’s stately goodwill. Smoking

55
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.160
opium and hosting wild gay orgies for the
other rich boys. He’s considered a black

56
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.080
sheep of the family and is — said — to
be the reason his relatives abandoned their

57
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.169
estate and relocated to the countryside. Though
that’s in question, as his father was involved

58
00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.770
in a treasonous plot, and then disappeared
shortly thereafter.

59
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.949
Seungho is constantly advised that his reputation
is going to run the family into the ground,

60
00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.900
but he doesn’t really much listen to that.
He neither has interest in politics nor business,

61
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.500
opting exclusively for hedonistic excess,
though commanding so much fear over the locals

62
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.080
that they keep theses rumour on hushed lips.
The other local highborn citizens tolerate

63
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.870
Yoon Seungho... from a distance.

64
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.730
By the time he ostensibly kidnaps Nakyum — and
later gaslights him into believing that he

65
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.370
chose to go with him — Seungho is already
deep into this cycle of rumour and privileged

66
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.360
dismissal. However, the first significant
change noted in Seungho’s character happens

67
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.680
shortly after he abducts Nakyum.

68
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.850
Nakyum had a teacher, you see, who is both
a role model and an object of his affection

69
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.070
— Jung In-Hun. When Seungho susses out who,
exactly, this learn’d man is, he tracks

70
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.520
him down in an attempt to somehow use him
to manipulate Nakyum into painting dirty pictures

71
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.449
— a task that Nakyum has, until that point,
actively resisted.

72
00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.010
When we meet Jung, it is shortly before he
is approached by Seungho. He is discussing

73
00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.229
why he does so little to teach children to
read — what he was literally employed to

74
00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:06.490
do — and spends so much time instead on
his own studies. He retorts that there isn’t

75
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.669
much point in educating children because they’re
going to be farmers, anyway, and it would

76
00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:16.300
just be a wasted skill. Thus, his talents
are in much better service to the state preparing

77
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.510
himself for a career in politics that has
yet to manifest.

78
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.740
And so he’s been living in this kind of
limbo of talking about getting stuff done

79
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.990
but not really doing anything and just living
off the goodwill of local farmers without

80
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.340
providing anything of substance in return.
So when Lord Yoon Seungho approaches him and

81
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.660
says that he would like to make Jung the first
state official the Yoon family has elevated

82
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:46.850
in decades, Jung jumps at the opportunity.
In spite of Seungho’s bad reputation, naturally.

83
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.820
Jung immediately suspects that as the reason
why Seungho keeps the kid around. And then

84
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.509
proceeds to do nothing but guilt-trip and
slut-shame Nakyum.

85
00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:02.639
Seeing Seungho as a threat, Jung decided he
needs more information as leverage. And so

86
00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:08.389
when he encounters Nakyum attempting to flee
Seungho who has, at this point, begun sexually

87
00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:13.669
assaulting him, Jung tells the painter that
he really ought to go back with him to the

88
00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:17.800
estate, and that Nakyum should spy on Seungho
for him.

89
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.039
And it should go without saying that Nakyum
is completely infatuated with Jung because

90
00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:28.060
boys like him in fiction have a thing for
jerks, bullies, and teachers. And it’s a

91
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.949
bit of an emotional blow when Jung does leave
the Yoon estate and the last thing he says

92
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:37.789
to Nakyum is that he’s become a filthy prostitute.

93
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.099
After that he’s moved out of the story.
Though, as he is consistently referenced,

94
00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:45.420
he will likely return when the third season
starts up again.

95
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.810
Since then, the recent twenty-odd chapters
have a much greater focus on class structure. 

96
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.810
Well… okay, the focus is, as always, the
white blob that would otherwise be Yoon Seungho’s

97
00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.330
penis. But in between those sections there
is a lot of drama that does not involve penises.

98
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.610
First — Seungho’s ex, Lee Jihwa, a noble
who he had dumped in favor of the painter,

99
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.670
figures he can win back Seungho by paying
a criminal named No-Name to assassinate Nakyum.

100
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.500
And… yes that is a little extreme, but it’s
not like he hasn’t tried a few other things

101
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.670
to sabotage Seungho’s opinion of the painter.

102
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.680
And Jihwa’s scheme ties into another sub
plot focusing on a servant in the Yoon Estate

103
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.950
who is more than a little upset at Nakyum’s
perceived privileges. Also the fact that Seungho

104
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.500
routinely beats the staff.

105
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.120
It doesn’t help that Seungho actively prevents
Nakyum from interacting with the servants,

106
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.600
despite Nakyum’s preference for taking meals
with them, working in the kitchens, and their

107
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.430
company in general. And Seungho will take
it out on the staff if he catches his delicate

108
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.450
painter sullying his hands with the other
common folk.

109
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.560
So he begins to dress Nakyum in fine clothes,
feeds him the best food the estate has to

110
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.470
offer — on top of the spacious living arrangements
he’s given to sleep and paint in. The trade

111
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:04.050
off is… you know. Complete sacrifice of
personal autonomy, isolation from loved ones,

112
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.830
and being shut off from the outside world
if he is not chaperoned by a Yoon servant.

113
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.420
Which, if Seungho has romantic feelings for
Nakyum, as much of the fanbase believes that

114
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.610
he does, you’d think he’d put in a little
more effort to making Nakyum smile. Jesus,

115
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.350
first Sangwoo, now Seungho — what is it
with fangirls flocking to men who make boys

116
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.350
cry?

117
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:30.310
Anyway, this slighted servant, Doek-Je — begins
to spy for team Jihwa. But he becomes a loose

118
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.040
end and has to be eliminated. Turns out nobody
noticed he was gone, though. Including me.

119
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.390
Nick had to point it out.

120
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.880
Jihwa also decides not to go through with
the assassination, and ends up bottoming for

121
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.040
the mega-hot daddy-assassin instead.

122
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.890
But that’s a sex scene we didn’t get to
see.

123
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.610
And while it may seem like the noble classes
are nothing but appalled when it comes to

124
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.269
even touching poor people, they seem to make
an exception when it comes to having sex with

125
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.950
them. Even if they hold it against each-other
when the post-nut clarity settles in.

126
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:04.300
Because, distracted by white-blob penises
though we may be, the very core of Painter

127
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:16.890
of the Night is about the many ways that rich
people… f*ck poor people.

128
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:29.450
So, hear me out, even outside just the general
rich person screwing poor person theme, there

129
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.790
is an abundance of other examples of class
interactions that we can read into in this

130
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.790
work.

131
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.650
Start with the… relationship between Nakyum
and Seungho. In the most direct terms, it’s

132
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.830
very much a class-based relationship.

133
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.940
You have a rich guy, and he’s literally
f*cking a poor guy. Whether the poor guy likes

134
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.940
it or not.

135
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.580
The whether-he-likes it or not is the curious
part. Because Nakyum does eventually find

136
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.601
himself aroused by Seungho. And he begins
to reject options to escape the manor, maybe

137
00:11:56.601 --> 00:12:01.990
even specifically to stay with Seungho. Though
there’s just as much evidence to say that

138
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.839
he is immensely threatened by Seungho, and
for good reason. Whether its using violence

139
00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:13.250
or extreme coercion, Seungho gets what he
wants.  And Nakyum, as a character, eventually

140
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.200
decides it’s easier to just fall in line.
And Painter of the Night really should depict

141
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.990
this development as a tragedy. And it does…
you just have to read into it a little…

142
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.990
a lot.

143
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.930
Those of wealth and power usually maintain
their wealth by a consistent threat of things

144
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:35.260
maybe getting worse for the poors around them.
It’s a very pivotal tactic of how those

145
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.190
in positions of authority manipulate the under-classes.

146
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.519
If you ask for the minimum wage to increase,
apparently, employers won’t have enough

147
00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:47.951
money to keep the lights on and then you’ll
lose out on your job altogether? Isn’t it

148
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:53.649
just better for everyone to keep wages the
way they are, so at least you’ll have SOMETHING?

149
00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:54.649
Or —

150
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:58.960
If everyone has universal healthcare, your
Unions will… explode… or something—

151
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.780
They never really make a clear argument for
that one.  Anyway.

152
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.840
I digress!

153
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.870
Eventually, Seungho does promise not to (physically)
hurt Nakyum anymore.

154
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.000
Though… this is immediately after threatening
to kill him and/or a close sister figure for

155
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.940
trying to escape. So even though Seungho does
seem like the safest option to Nakyum at this

156
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.100
point, alternative options have been systemically
blocked, removed, and forbidden. 

157
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.470
And so when Nakyum turns to Seungho for protection
or comfort, it’s because there has been

158
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.980
such a dependency fostered that there’s
simply no other way for him to receive the

159
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.080
human needs that he has been starved for.

160
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.570
(Which… this is the point in our world where
Wal-Mart has already shut down the last independent

161
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.649
retail store so you’re either working for
the Waltons, or you’re collecting welfare.

162
00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:51.980
And your democratic state representative has
just said ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’

163
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:58.300
in a speech so you know what’s coming next.
You don’t have a choice, but hey… you

164
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.639
are consistently told that you have your freedom.)  Just
like Nakyum is consistently told that he has

165
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:10.450
a choice. That he chose to live there. That
he chooses to sleep with Seungho. Just like

166
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.680
corporate America tells you that you, personally,
chose for that Walmart to open up and suck

167
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.560
business and jobs out of your community — to
take those profits out of the community where

168
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.360
they end up horded in a Walmart corporate
account somewhere offshore.

169
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.550
Yes, this dependency was also an element of
Killing Stalking, and it’s just as not-okay

170
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:34.329
here as it was there — maybe more so here
because it is framed as at least somewhat

171
00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:40.220
romantic. However, unlike Killing Stalking,
there is an additional class dynamic at play.

172
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.339
Especially one where a great amount of detail
is given to character interactions. Seungho’s

173
00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:48.100
interactions are the most ubiquitous, but
other characters have a great deal of significance

174
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.100
as well.

175
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.250
Jung In-Hun, for instance, Nakyum’s teacher,
Is an educated man with political aspirations.

176
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.980
He’s dissatisfied living as a teacher and
yearns for a political station which he feels

177
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.730
he deserves, though does absolutely nothing
but sit on his ass to achieve. He makes it

178
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:08.170
very clear that he sees himself as above the
common farmers in the area, and that he’s

179
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.810
quite far above Nakyum.

180
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.170
He sees Nakyum as a disappointment, a degenerate
who chooses to paint pornography. Even though

181
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:20.310
Nakyum both used his trade in order to survive,
and began painting these scenes to cope with

182
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.860
traumatic experiences he witnessed growing
up in what may be a the equivalent of a brothel. 

183
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.370
All the while Jung takes Nakyum’s reverence
for him for granted, at the same time as actively

184
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.810
not giving a single thought to Nakyum’s
circumstances. Jung consistently berates Nakyum

185
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:42.550
for engaging in Seungho’s perversions, even
though he, himself owes his livelihood to

186
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.550
Seungho.

187
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:50.449
Jung is an intended social climber. He’s
willing to make exceptions for where he, himself

188
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:55.649
relies on the wealthy because he fully expects
that he, himself, belongs among them.

189
00:15:55.649 --> 00:16:00.550
Seungho, both in front of Jung and behind
his back, makes it clear he doesn’t really

190
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.870
have strong feelings for the teacher one way
or another. He openly tells Jung that he’s

191
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:10.440
not at smart as he thinks he is and Jung stomachs
the insults, because he still needs Seungho

192
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.980
to achieve his goals. But Jung’s ego never
really lets it get under his skin as much

193
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.980
as it should.

194
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.100
He’s more than happy to lick the boot...
as long as it gets him ahead. 

195
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:28.040
He doesn’t have any principles to speak
of... as long as it gets him ahead. 

196
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.520
He cares for Nakyum when it’s convenient,
but if Nakyum’s safety is entirely secondary

197
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.529
to his social climb, and if Nakyum isn’t
helping HIM first and foremost, he doesn’t

198
00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:41.800
really have much patience for the boy’s
complaining. 

199
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.050
Regardless of how both he and Nakyum suffer
under Seungho. Okay, all Jung has to endure

200
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.279
is the occasional jab at his bad poetry. But
regardless of how they both dislike Seungho,

201
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:59.160
Jung will routinely badger Nakyum into respecting
the due etiquette of the social classes.

202
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.930
Because if Jung tells Nakyum to fight Seungho,
or run away, or do anything to subvert him,

203
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.589
then he is telling Nakyum to fight against
the system that he plans to be part of.

204
00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:15.189
I would venture to say that he’s even more
unlikable than Seungho. Because as a character…

205
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:20.800
at least Seungho is upfront about what he’s
after, and honest about his methods. This

206
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.600
theme goes less like ‘power corrupts’
and is more like ‘the ability to acquire

207
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.829
power corrupts.’ 

208
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:34.090
Or even ‘the presence of power, even if
unobtainable, corrupts.’

209
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.190
Because even if Jung does become a government
official, with no real textual evidence that

210
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.059
he comes from a respected family, he is just
one individual. Maybe in a few generations

211
00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:48.629
his descendants can have real authority, but
his name does not carry legacy the way ‘Yoon’

212
00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:51.230
does, even if the family is in decline.

213
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:56.100
Jung may not be as smart as he thinks he is,
but he knows he’s never going to have the

214
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.200
kind of social station that Seungho is pissing
away, because Seungho’s station was built

215
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.580
up by several generations of nobles before
him. But, Jung does want to climb as high

216
00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:13.149
as possible within his station, and he will
step on anyone to get where he thinks he belongs.

217
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:18.269
Which means stepping on people who were born
into even lower stations than he was. And

218
00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:33.940
everyone under him and Seungho… who do they
get to step on?

219
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.299
When it comes to individuals in Nakyum’s
own social class, there are servants and escorts.

220
00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:41.270
That’s about all he has access to.

221
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:48.179
In many cases, especially at first, they don’t
understand why this lowly painter of no renown

222
00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:52.840
has earned so much of Lord Yoon’s attention.
Yes, they know his reputation — the servants

223
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.590
live around him. And it’s to be expected
that Seungho’s sexual appetite demands fresh

224
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.210
meat from time to time.

225
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.609
But especially as Seungho begins to feed,
dress, and afford luxuries to Nakyum befitting

226
00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:10.769
a noble, there was, at first, a question of
why a poor boy was lifted up by a local lord

227
00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:12.539
for no discernible reason?

228
00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:19.539
And then, for some, if not many, that question
shifted to: “How dare he?”

229
00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:26.100
Indeed, as voiced by one character, Doek-Je,
there is rising descent among the staff who,

230
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.330
upon the orders of Seungho, are forced to
wait on Nakyum. It seems that not everyone

231
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.419
is happy about having to serve someone who
is within their same social bracket. Nakyum

232
00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:39.470
is not a lord, nor an esteemed guest, nor
was he born into any station of respect. To

233
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.460
them, Nakyum is just like them… or at least
he OUGHT to be.

234
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.929
Doek-Je recalls how he was recently beaten
by Seungho because he believed that Nakyum

235
00:19:48.929 --> 00:19:50.620
was trying to escape.

236
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.799
And so… because Seungho was so angry that
a boy he’s been tormenting was found trying

237
00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:02.549
to escape, he takes it out on the staff. He
literally beats his entire staff because of

238
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:05.720
something that Nakyum was blamed for doing
.

239
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.759
Due to one of these routine staff beatings,
Doek-Je claims that he actually lost some

240
00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:14.720
of his vision. And rather than blame the guy
who beat the crap out of him, he blames Nakyum.

241
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.049
Which is indicative of how the rich will pit
the poor against the poor, in spite of being

242
00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:22.269
the reason for poverty in the first place.

243
00:20:22.269 --> 00:20:27.080
We’ve seen, as the audience, that this hasn’t
particularly been a picnic for Nakyum. And

244
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.440
we’ve seen that all of his privileges come
with a very steep cost. And yet, almost every

245
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.979
outsider looking in on the twisted relationship
between Nakyum and Seungho places the blame

246
00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:41.080
on Nakyum.

247
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.669
Ranging from Nakyum’s quote-unquote ‘choice’
to remain with Seungho, and sometimes even

248
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:52.120
venturing as far to say that Nakyum is explicitly
seducing Seungho to win over his favour.

249
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.149
It’s a common element of bitter, short-sighted
people to look at the various benefits that

250
00:20:56.149 --> 00:21:00.909
are afforded to others. Take for instance…
a jobs program to make sure inbound refugees

251
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:02.109
have paying work.

252
00:21:02.109 --> 00:21:07.249
To some people, that may appear as if they
are being granted privileges that set them

253
00:21:07.249 --> 00:21:11.940
far above those who were naturally born into
the country. They see this and think: “My

254
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:17.690
government is doing nothing to help ME. And
yet they help THOSE PEOPLE.” For which they

255
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.429
will then resent these landed refugees.

256
00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:25.370
And there begins a contemptuous exchange between
these two groups. One group leaning towards

257
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.979
nationalism, and the other, pushed into alienation.
All the while, completely ignoring the fact

258
00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:36.489
that the controlling powers have every opportunity
to establish a jobs program for everyone.

259
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:40.720
Or even a Universal Basic Income, in countries
that are wealthy enough.

260
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.809
However, this is not the only way our culture
is encouraged to resent and envy individuals

261
00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:51.349
who are perceived to bite off more than their
fair share. As much as we like to believe

262
00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:56.360
that social mobility is a staple of our culture,
we really don’t have anything but contempt

263
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.700
for people who prove that rags to riches is
possible.

264
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.539
Look at tabloid magazines. They have a very
clear idea of women that are ‘good’ and

265
00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:11.220
women that are ‘bad.’ During her heyday,
Jennifer Lopez was made a staunch example

266
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.049
of excess, overspending, and lavish lifestyle.
And while the measure of her character is

267
00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:20.279
not the debate here, she did grow up in the
projects.

268
00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:25.299
Her success may have been one in a million,
but it was still something that she achieved

269
00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:29.849
regardless. But — there was a huge audience
of people who wanted nothing more than to

270
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:33.330
know how awful she was for spending her money
the way she did.

271
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.529
Jenny from the block, and others like her,
are useful as symbols to project that class

272
00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:44.159
mobility is possible. However, as soon as
they transition into the perceived upper echelons

273
00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:48.889
of society, they become symbols not of hope,
but envy.

274
00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:53.419
Meanwhile, there is little wealth-shaming
projected at people who are already wealthy

275
00:22:53.419 --> 00:22:57.700
before they were famous. Nobody bats an eye
about whatever the Kardashians are overspending

276
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.240
on. 

277
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.749
The clearest example I can POSSIBLY think
of is the media demonization of Meghan Markle.

278
00:23:08.749 --> 00:23:14.789
This woman has been dragged through the coals
up and down for years.

279
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:19.429
Tabloids attack a black woman for marrying
into wealth — a level of wealth that also

280
00:23:19.429 --> 00:23:25.320
includes titles and ceremony. They run photographs
of her which can, with the addition of a sinister

281
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.340
headline, make her look sneaky or manipulative.

282
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.690
Meanwhile, this same tabloid will run wholesome
family pictures of Prince William and Kate

283
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.350
with their children.

284
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.470
Somehow in a video about illustrated Korean
gay porn we ended up talking about the House

285
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.359
of Windsor. Do you SEE? THIS IS THE KIND OF
INFLUENCE THEY HA—

286
00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:46.610
It seems to me that staff beatings at the
Yoon estate are a regular occurrence. At least,

287
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.590
nobody seems surprised that it’s happening.
When in reality, there’s nothing stopping

288
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.630
the staff from collectively dropping a rock
on Yoon Seungho’s head while he’s asleep.

289
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:56.890
Unions. They work.

290
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.450
(Damnit. That’s a good slogan…)

291
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:03.190
However, aside from Doek-Je, other servants
seem to have different opinions on Nakyum.

292
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.830
And this is interesting because there is a
very clear division in these responses. Men.

293
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.720
Almost universally approach Naykum’s circumstances
with a kind of envy or even jealousy. Whether

294
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.829
it’s good food, a warm room, or fine clothes,
or whether it’s Seungho’s favor. 

295
00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:23.830
Nakyum is receiving treatment they want — he
does not appear to be working as hard as they

296
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.779
are. Ergo, he must be... cheating? Somehow...

297
00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:31.559
It’s… not really a thought process that
comes from an ability to reason.

298
00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.559
However.

299
00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:37.969
What few women characters exist in the plot
seem to empathize much more with Nakyum. The

300
00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:44.509
female servants around the Yoon estate seem
to take a liking to him. And for various reasons,

301
00:24:44.509 --> 00:24:51.111
actively deter him from participating in chores,
though he seems to offer. Is this a demand

302
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:56.029
from Seungho? Does Nakyum get in the way?
Or do they understand the circumstances of

303
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:58.469
Nakyums… indenturement…?

304
00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:03.259
It would make sense that the characters who
empathize with Nakyum are women. In an overwhelming

305
00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:08.269
array of societies around the world, women
have very little in the way of social mobility.

306
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:12.940
If anyone would understand the harrowing effect
of having privileges at the expense of personal

307
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.759
agency, it would probably be women. Especially
in this time period.

308
00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:23.210
It’s also possible that the author is projecting
herself onto these women in the story, reflecting

309
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.359
her own attitudes about Nakyum’s circumstances. 

310
00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:30.990
Which leads me into the big question about
this story… are all these character interactions

311
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.019
deliberately crafted to signify larger, cultural
themes about class, privilege, wealth, heraldry,

312
00:25:36.019 --> 00:25:37.399
and social status?

313
00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:41.999
Or is it just horny content focused on presenting
the taboo of queer romance where women are

314
00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:47.330
meant to project themselves onto the effeminate
man, and all other elements are present to

315
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:51.960
drive as many plot complications as possible
in order to strum up drama?

316
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.260
With Killing Stalking, when I asked this question,
it was tokenism. I’m fairly confident in

317
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.719
that case, it was a very explicitly crafted
story with clear, projected themes in mind.

318
00:26:02.719 --> 00:26:07.679
But honestly… with Painter of the Night?
There’s a lot of evidence pointing one way

319
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:08.679
or the other.

320
00:26:08.679 --> 00:26:13.799
But really, whether it’s subliminal anti-classist
propaganda that uses bad-taste porn to radicalize

321
00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:20.739
an army of fujoshis, or whether it’s just
bad-taste porn, I don’t think that really

322
00:26:20.739 --> 00:26:22.009
makes a difference.

323
00:26:22.009 --> 00:26:27.909
On one hand, it’s an author inserting class
discourse into low-brow media. Or — these

324
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:33.799
discussions around class and wealth have permeated
society enough that it’s even finding its

325
00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:38.759
way into low-brow media, naturally. Either
way it’s kind of a win, right?

326
00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:44.799
This… is where it gets a little muddy, though.
Because while what I have discussed certainly

327
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:50.629
depicts Painter of the Night as a sleeper
socialist recruitment manual of sorts… I

328
00:26:50.629 --> 00:26:55.179
haven’t really talked about the optics of
framing techniques in the narrative.

329
00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:58.479
Optics. The ‘woke white person’s’ favourite
word.

330
00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:01.950
Really though, boiling it down, you’ve got
a story called ‘Painter of the Night.’

331
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.529
And yet, Nakyum, the titular character, has
remarkably little character, no motivations

332
00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:12.269
other than self preservation, no indication
of what his life would be if he wasn’t trapped

333
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:16.979
in this situation, he doesn’t express any
desires, nor any drive to really participate

334
00:27:16.979 --> 00:27:23.039
in the plot, nor resist it. The story goes
to a much greater length to describe how Nakyum

335
00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:26.200
is feminine than what kind of personality
he has.

336
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.869
Meanwhile, with Nakyum as a proxy, the reader
is presented to Seungho, who has much more

337
00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:36.739
personality, if an inconsistent one. We have
a much clearer idea of Seungho’s motivations.

338
00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:41.169
We see Seungho’s character progression.
He holds the active role both in the plot

339
00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:47.210
and character dynamics with basically everyone.
And at any available opportunity, Seungho

340
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.929
steps in the room and derails whatever conversation
is going on.

341
00:27:50.929 --> 00:27:55.950
It seems very clear to me that Nakyum is a
cypher for the audience, namely women, as

342
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:01.759
per Nakyum’s ability to expose Seungho to
said audience. As the story is ongoing, I’m

343
00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:08.440
not really able to say how this resolves - if
Seungho continues to be a bit of a psychopath

344
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:15.730
or if he changes — which would help to moralize
his character and problematic elements.

345
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:21.009
Though regardless of whether this is a misapplied
cautionary tale, or a wish-fulfilment nobility-fetish,

346
00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:24.440
I think the writing is on the wall about one
thing.

347
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.869
Rich man. Literally a rapist. Gaslighting,
abusive, classist.

348
00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:33.760
I totally get having taboo fantasies. And
far be it from me to tell someone that they

349
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.929
aren’t allowed to draw or write this fantasy
because it’s politically incorrect.

350
00:28:37.929 --> 00:28:43.859
That said… there are other ways to depict
a naughty rich-poor gay sex affair.

351
00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:47.529
Take, for instance, the alternate universe
spin-off series of Painter of the Night, where

352
00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:53.090
Seungho and Nakyum’s social roles are reversed.
As the son of a wealthy family, Nakyum tires

353
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:59.609
to ply his craft as an erotic painter under
a psudeunam, and Seungho is the village pervert

354
00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:03.619
getting thrown out of houses by angry fathers.
And here… the little differences make it

355
00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:08.289
clear that the author is going for something
a bit more complex than just the porn that

356
00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:10.539
this could be easily read as.

357
00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:15.799
First of all, as a rich son, Nakyum is a little
bit embarrassed by his dirty art, but he does

358
00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:22.229
not have such a shame complex about it. However...
Seungho, by contrast to his main-universe

359
00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:25.210
variant, never seems to violate consent.

360
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:30.820
In either case, the author knows how an elevated
station affects either character. From a position

361
00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:37.440
of privilege, Seungho has a much greater entitlement
to… what he wants out of people in general.

362
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.720
Power and privilege in this case, just takes
elements of his character and twists it into

363
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.879
something vile.

364
00:29:42.879 --> 00:29:49.149
Nakyum is more or less the same person though.
Power doesn’t corrupt. Power doesn’t always

365
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:53.249
corrupt. It reveals. Someone doesn't become
evil just by gaining power. Power just allows

366
00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:55.730
them to do what they always wanted to do. 

367
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.450
But this does take place in an alternate universe
timeline. So…

368
00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:07.139
If only there was some OTHER well-known, nuanced
Korean media which deliberately depicts class

369
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:12.809
conflicts from which we could cross-reference
themes, depictions, and attitudes about wealth

370
00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:19.909
and social standing…

371
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:30.629
Parasite. Holy sh*t. I can tell you, I went
into this film with high expectations leading

372
00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:35.009
up to the 2019 Oscars and it somehow exceeded
all of them.

373
00:30:35.009 --> 00:30:39.860
Parasite is the story of a very poor Family
— the Kims and their children, Ki-Woo and

374
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:45.739
Ki-Jung. Times are hard. From getting swindled
on odd jobs they do, to being a 4-person family

375
00:30:45.739 --> 00:30:50.250
living in a literal basement stealing wifi
from their upstairs neighbours on cellphones.

376
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.929
Their son manages to find work teaching English
to the daughter of a rich family, the Parks.

377
00:30:54.929 --> 00:31:00.279
And the Parks are like… indicated to be
MEGA rich. Like. Korean ELITE.

378
00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:05.039
So much so that, as the Kims progressively
hash out plots to replace the Parks’ current

379
00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:09.440
staff with themselves, their daughter makes
the process that much easier by creating a

380
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.000
fake hiring service that requires you to list
your annual income before you can even be

381
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.249
considered. You know, to keep out the only
so-so riches away.

382
00:31:18.249 --> 00:31:22.070
And none of the Parks bat an eyelash at that.

383
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.691
The scary thing is that these elite services
actually do exist. You know, there’s a ‘facebook

384
00:31:26.691 --> 00:31:32.059
for rich people’ which, is a paid service,
but REQUIRES a $20,000 up-front payment to

385
00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:33.059
gain entry to.

386
00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:39.330
If I had $20,000 you can bet your ass I’d
have better things to spend it on that a social

387
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.359
media platform.
And up to this point… yes. Parasite is a

388
00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:51.029
tongue-and-cheek showcase of the ways the
wealthy exist in a bubble of complete obliviousness.

389
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:56.460
But when the Parks go out for a camping trip
one weekend, the Kims decide they’re going

390
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:02.049
to live in luxury for a few days. Before this,
the Kims were depicted very positively. Yes,

391
00:32:02.049 --> 00:32:07.119
they caused mischief to get a little bit ahead,
but you SAW where they came from, with some

392
00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:11.249
comedically heavy-handed metaphors to boot.
You still kinda rooted for them.

393
00:32:11.249 --> 00:32:12.639
Especially compared to the Parks. 

394
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:18.200
The Kims were in a relatively loving, affectionate
marriage. Mr. Park, however, refused to even

395
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.710
say that he loved his wife.

396
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:26.709
The Kim children are shown to have a wide
array of talents and skills. The Park children…

397
00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:31.959
The Kims work to find creative ways to solve
problems and do what they need to to survive.

398
00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:36.849
The Parks take literally everything for granted
and completely believe that they work harder

399
00:32:36.849 --> 00:32:39.229
than others to maintain their status.

400
00:32:39.229 --> 00:32:42.889
Though, even while the Kims treat themselves
to a weekend alone in the Parks’ modern

401
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:47.390
manor, in a very short time, they develop
a number of the Parks’ tendencies. 

402
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:52.619
Mr. and Mrs. Kim threaten each other with
violence, though play it off as a joke. They

403
00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:57.279
take their newfound success for granted. And
they use the weekend to eat lots and drink

404
00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:01.600
expensive liquor without any regard to how
anything could go wrong.

405
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.360
At which point the former maid, Moon-Gwang
shows up begging to be let in. She immediately

406
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.739
goes to a secret basement hidden behind a
shelf in the pantry. As she was a maid who

407
00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:16.369
worked in the house from when it was originally
built, she has been keeping her husband there

408
00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:21.390
— the whole time in the basement — to
keep him away from loan sharks.

409
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:27.649
Moon-Gwang literally begs on her knees for
Mrs. Kim, who succeeded her as the live-in

410
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:32.830
housekeeper under a pseudonym, to not tell
anyone he is there, and to let her show up,

411
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.570
now and then, to care for her husband. She
even offers a bribe. 

412
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:42.129
At which point, Ms. Kim not only denies her,
but insults her, threatens to call the police

413
00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:47.429
— regardless of the fact that Ms. Kim and
her family, not long ago, were living in similar

414
00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:52.309
sort of desperation. Folding pizza boxes and
only getting paid for a fraction of the work.

415
00:33:52.309 --> 00:33:58.039
Ms. Kim had been portrayed as a bit of a b*tch
before then… but she was a likable figure.

416
00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:00.289
She was never this cold before.

417
00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:04.429
The other three Kims were eavesdropping at
the time, and accidentally slip and reveal

418
00:34:04.429 --> 00:34:09.020
themselves. Moon-Gwang and her husband record
the event on a phone, and threaten to reveal

419
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.379
the whole plot to the Parks.

420
00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:16.419
And then the two families find themselves
upstairs. Moon-Gwang and her husband enjoy

421
00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:22.470
the merriment the Kims had afforded themselves,
while the Kims cower against the wall like

422
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:26.790
hostages. Moon-Gwang and her husband rave
and recall the glory days of living in the

423
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.799
open together, while exchanging compliments
about how powerful they are, waving around

424
00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:33.879
the phone they can blackmail the Kims with.

425
00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:39.190
A finger hovering over the ‘SEND’ button
compared to a North Korean dictator hovering

426
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.849
over the ‘LAUNCH’ button.

427
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:46.470
Moon-Gwang (before: so quiet, respectful,
and soft spoken) is now being compared to

428
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.960
a dictator with a nuclear arsenal, and she
is revelling in it. But the Kims take advantage

429
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.720
of the distraction, and wrestle the phone
from Moon-Gwang. In an extended full-family

430
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.000
wrestling match.

431
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.020
At which point it’s curious that these poor
people weren’t even fighting to be successful.

432
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:10.079
They were fighting other poor people for who
will have the PRIVILEGE of licking the rich

433
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.619
family’s boots.

434
00:35:11.619 --> 00:35:16.549
Just look at what Moon-Gwang’s husband had
been doing underground for the prior decade.

435
00:35:16.549 --> 00:35:22.119
He had… for some reason, taken to revering
Mr. Park so strongly that it approaches religious

436
00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:28.191
fanaticism. He concluded that the man who
owned the house over the bomb shelter he had

437
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:31.980
spent so long in must be a man of great respect.

438
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.670
Mr. Park arrives home every night at the exact
same time. Moon-Gwang’s husband is ready

439
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.990
every night to activate the lights leading
up to the living room, and screams his praises

440
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:46.619
to a Lord who cannot hear his reveries between
two meters of concrete. 

441
00:35:46.619 --> 00:35:50.260
Mr. Park does not know there is a man in the
basement who feels inclined to dedicate his

442
00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.760
every breath to him. And if he did know, he
probably wouldn’t be a fan of the idea.

443
00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:01.390
The point is that the rich are ambivalent
to the poor if they are not DIRECTLY serving

444
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.750
or supporting them. And even then, they’re
disposable. Like the driver. Like the housekeeper.

445
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.849
And the lights over the stairs leading to
the living room? The ones that Moon-Gwang’s

446
00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:15.390
husband ritualistically activates? The Parks
don’t think too much about it. Lights mysteriously

447
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.279
turning on? It’s a rich people house. Don’t
worry about it. It’s a rich people house

448
00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:20.279
thing.

449
00:36:20.279 --> 00:36:21.279
It’s a sensor. 

450
00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:24.869
Later, when Moon-Gwang’s husband, his wife
now bleeding out after being pushed down the

451
00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:30.869
stairs by Mrs. Kim, bashes his bloody head
against the switch to tap out messages in

452
00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:34.539
morse code… it’s just the sensor acting
up. Pay it no mind.

453
00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:40.730
The literal life or death situations that
poor people are trying to communicate are

454
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:48.859
dismissed as a malfunction. A glitch in the
system. Obscure messages needing to be decoded

455
00:36:48.859 --> 00:36:53.630
are just white noise. A byproduct of civilization.

456
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.760
Ms. Kim accidentally-on-purpose murdered Moon-Gwang…
over who gets to have the ability to serve

457
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:04.279
a made-up luxury beef ramen bowl to the Parks.
Complaining about how awful the rain is while

458
00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:06.670
a woman is dying under their feet.

459
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.369
It’s worse than active hatred. It’s complete
ambivalence.

460
00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:16.720
Ms. Park praising the rain for clearing out
smog after the Kims have to take refuge from

461
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.040
a flood.

462
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.430
Mr. Park threatening to fire Mr. Kim if he
doesn’t don a ridiculous outfit to stage

463
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.310
a ridiculous skit for a birthday party.

464
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:32.720
And then Mr. Park’s complete disgust at
the sight of the Kim daughter’s blood. Refusing

465
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.599
to call for an ambulance, instead demanding
Mr. Kim to give him his car keys so he can

466
00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:42.970
get away from the awful sight. Sheepishly
taking them for himself when Mr. Kim would

467
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.339
not abandon his dying daughter.

468
00:37:45.339 --> 00:37:52.170
The final result is Ms. Kim and her son Ki-Woo
facing criminal charges, after the son endured

469
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:58.980
severe head trauma. Tried, prosecuted, his
sister dead, and his father on the run. He

470
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.569
has a brain injury where he laughs chronically.

471
00:38:01.569 --> 00:38:05.549
Why wouldn’t he? Smile. Things COULD be
worse.

472
00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:11.590
And Mr. Kim? He’s wanted for the murder
of Mr. Park. But it turns out that he’s

473
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:16.799
been hiding in the secret bomb shelter. Living
as Moon-Gwang’s husband once did. Flicking

474
00:38:16.799 --> 00:38:22.720
on the lights for the new homeowners and sobbing
in grief to a magazine cutout of Mr. Park,

475
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.530
who he regrets murdering, and misses dearly.
Reveres… even. 

476
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:34.320
There is no change. No resolution. A couple
faces were swapped. Nothing gained; nothing

477
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.869
lost.

478
00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:38.460
BUT! There is hope… 

479
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.750
Nick: “For a better future?”

480
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.069
PFFT. No.

481
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:48.880
There’s hope that someday Ki-Woo will be
able to go back to school, be successful himself

482
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.440
and one day buy that house so his father can
live in the light once more. But that’s

483
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.530
just a dream. It’s just a hope. He has hope
that he will succeed in the system, so why

484
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.829
does anything need to change?

485
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:05.839
There… aren’t any heroes in this story.
This isn’t a story of how this one rich

486
00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:11.960
family was terrible. This was a story about
a social structure which permits this family

487
00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:20.569
to be this rich while these poor families
could be this poor. And how, at the end of

488
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:25.480
it, the system only recognizes the rich people
as victims.

489
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.920
The same set of laws which allowed the Parks
to be as wealthy as they were, were the set

490
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.240
of laws which punished the Kims for doing
what they had to do the scrape by.

491
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.980
Did the Kims get a bit too ambitious by replacing
the whole household staff? Did they bite off

492
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.950
too much? Did they get too greedy? Maybe.

493
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:50.760
But if petty drama to fire a few people is
greed… what does that make the Parks? Who

494
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.350
have indicatively more than enough expendable
income to support all six poor people. Pay

495
00:39:55.350 --> 00:40:00.950
off their loans, pay for their wifi. Send
the Kim kids to school — it’s clear that

496
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.990
they have the talent for it, but not the finances.

497
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:08.600
In a system where you can be as talented,
motivated, and driven to pull off all the

498
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:15.190
sh*t Kims managed to pull off — why do we
punish them for not having any options for

499
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:19.580
how to use their talents?

500
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:25.910
The film is called parasite because everyone
is one. The Kims, yes, leach off of the Parks.

501
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:32.190
But the Parks have been leaching off of countless
families like the Kims. In class dynamics,

502
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.420
parasites BEGET parasites.

503
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:41.769
Which is worse? The ones who feed for their
survival? Or ones who feed for excess?

504
00:40:41.769 --> 00:40:44.809
The film’s answer is intended to be obvious.

505
00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:50.700
But, most unsettlingly, what does the film
suggest about the Kims’ son vowing to become

506
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.619
successful enough to one day purchase the
house his father is trapped in? Does his goal

507
00:40:55.619 --> 00:41:00.289
make his quest for success any more noble
than why Mr. Park chose to be so wealthy? 

508
00:41:00.289 --> 00:41:05.450
We’ve seen how the Kims respond to privileges,
even imaginary ones. Who is the junior Kim

509
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:10.460
going to have to become to fulfill his promise
to his father?

510
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:17.480
By survival, the cycle continues. By success,
the cycle continues. Greed begets envy. Envy

511
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.809
begets desperation. And that desperation begets
criminal labels on people who cannot succeed

512
00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:33.190
within the established system.

513
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:38.819
What interests me is the fact that there are
so many parallel themes across Parasite and

514
00:41:38.819 --> 00:41:45.029
Painter of the Night. An Oscar winning film,
and an online comic. A modern day parable,

515
00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:49.740
and a historic erotica. Furthermore, that
a historic depiction of Feudal Korea contains

516
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:54.119
the same structures of inescapable inequality
as a modern depiction of South Korea under

517
00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:55.440
capitalism.

518
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.840
Because it’s not as if the circumstances
around wealth and privilege in Parasite AND

519
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.730
Painter of the Night are just made up. For
many people, the Kim’s lives ARE a reality.

520
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.661
There are plenty of desperate people willing
to do desperate things to survive, and even

521
00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:15.309
more desperate things to thrive. I grew up
with those people. A lot of things I had as

522
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:17.710
a kid “fell off the back of a truck”.

523
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.089
And Nakyum’s circumstances can be found
in a SHOCKING number of relationships. How

524
00:42:22.089 --> 00:42:26.410
many people stay with abusive partners because
they feel like they have no other option?

525
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:31.280
That someone else might treat them worse.
The monster you don’t know is scarier than

526
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.880
the monster you do know.

527
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:39.690
And so it comes down to power. In Parasite,
the Kims have no power. In Painter of the

528
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:45.960
Night, Nakyum has no power. And so they must
rely on people who do have power. And in our

529
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.940
world, power and wealth are synonymous. 

530
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:55.049
The queer community has forever been in the
shoes of Nakyum and the Kims. No power. Begging

531
00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:59.490
the powerful to let us have some scraps so
that we might survive. To make our relationships

532
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:03.430
legitimate in the eyes of the law. To make
killing us a hate crime. To make our very

533
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.450
existence legal.

534
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.930
And those in power, mostly straight white
men, have the ability to make us do whatever

535
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:17.099
they want in exchange for said scraps. Because
of desperation. The desperation of the powerless

536
00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:19.500
leads to disturbing things.

537
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.619
The desperation of Nakyum to endure assault,
gaslighting, and rape in exchange for some

538
00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:29.329
amount of comfort. The desperation of the
Kims to throw other people in their social

539
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:34.819
standing under the bus so that they can have
a vacation in a house that the owners of…

540
00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:40.230
take vacations from. The desperation of people
all over the world, fleeing wars, climate

541
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:42.359
disasters, murderous governments, and fascism.

542
00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:46.690
I wanted to make this video because I read
an online comic with gay themes and thought

543
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.970
I’d talk about it. Hell, with the third
season coming up, YouTube’s algorithm might

544
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.820
even be nice to this video.

545
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.480
But the more Nick and I dug into the subtext
of Painter of the Night, the more I realized

546
00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.029
that it’s not just a very well drawn porn.
On the surface, yes, absolutely. Porn. But

547
00:44:02.029 --> 00:44:06.930
under the surface, and not even that deep
down, there was a very intriguing commentary

548
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:13.349
on class, society, and the desperate actions
of the powerless. The ongoing war of rich

549
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:18.970
VS poor. Of the powerful vs the powerless.
Of the people who own things… and the people

550
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:19.970
who own nothing.

551
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.700
If you’re watching this video you’re very
likely a part of that second group. We’re

552
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:30.089
all fighting back against a system set up
to keep us in a very specific place in society.

553
00:44:30.089 --> 00:44:34.940
With just enough hope to keep us going, but
not nearly enough opportunity for all of us

554
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:39.329
to succeed. For all of us to reach the heights
of our potential.

555
00:44:39.329 --> 00:44:44.099
With the rich having their way, they’ll
have us attacking each other for scraps of

556
00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:48.170
opportunities. Hope has very limited vacancies.

557
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:54.119
There is always a system, a Park Family, a
Seungho, keeping us in our place. Making sure

558
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:58.370
we don’t reach too far, don’t ask for
too much. Not without their permission. Not

559
00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.880
without them controlling it, or at least owning
a piece of it. Telling us that we should be

560
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.190
grateful that they give us the opportunity
to work for them, to create for them.

561
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:13.180
The privileged get what they want. Whether
it’s tax breaks for hoarding wealth, a trip

562
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.089
to space, or someone’s body.

563
00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:21.960
And, unsettlingly, it’s incredibly cost-effective
for rich people to just change the rules so

564
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.640
they can get exactly what they want. If they
even feel the need. After all. If the punishment

565
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.710
for a crime is just a fine, then that’s
a crime the rich can get away with.

566
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:37.000
And isn’t that what we’re made to think
the entire purpose of wealth is? Being afforded

567
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.329
opportunities to get what you want. No matter
what. The more you have, the more you can

568
00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:43.400
get away with.

569
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.369
And it’s this pivotal association that I
think is so toxic. Wealth should buy comfort

570
00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:51.430
— not power. And certainly not survival.

571
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:56.340
Our freedom — our agency is determined by
people who already have the freedom to do

572
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.740
just about anything they want.

573
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:06.079
As individuals, we may not have a lot of power.
But our strength is in Our cooperation. Our

574
00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:10.759
numbers. The rich know how powerful numbers
can be, and that’s why they do everything

575
00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:15.710
they can to divide us. To create as many minority
categories as possible. To pit the middle

576
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.500
class against the poor. The poor against the
destitute.

577
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:30.789
But if we could just, for a moment, show them
how powerful we can be together. There’s

578
00:46:30.789 --> 00:47:42.430
no telling the change we can bring.
