00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.799
um
so what are we talking about today we

16
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.920
are talking about the shifting landscape
of hollywood last week we talked about

17
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.560
the shifting landscape of streaming this
uh this day this day

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.840
this day
on this day um i feel like we it's worth

19
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.520
it to kind of have like a sister episode
talking about uh how hollywood is

20
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.720
shifting especially going into this um
new roaring 20s that we're entering yes

21
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.720
the new roaring 20s that will hopefully
be a roaring 20s and not just a [ __ ]

22
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
show like it's been for the last two
years yeah um great start i mean like

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.600
the the roaring twenties also didn't
start on a bang either it started with

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.560
the pandemic yes it did yeah they called
the flu so spanish flu right maybe no

25
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.040
avian flu was more recent yeah spanish
flu okay um

26
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.000
and once again there was a problem with
people not wearing masks and not people

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.040
not so not the social distancing and
icelandic people just not taking it

28
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.920
seriously and we don't really talk about
it but that lasted for like two or three

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.080
years well it was about three years
two years was the core of it and then it

30
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.959
kind of fizzled off and then the roaring
twenties happened maybe we're in the

31
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.440
fizzle yeah the roaring twenties as we
know them happened only in like a five

32
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.599
to eight year span depending on where
you were really yeah um and then the

33
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.959
great depression hit so like we talk
about it like it's a decade but it was a

34
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.599
sec a very
intense section of a decade with a

35
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.120
massive amount of social change and of
course going into the depression

36
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.519
certainly sucked and hopefully the 2030s
are not a depression but you know what i

37
00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.400
did great during the depression unions
the film industry

38
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.360
staying on topic

39
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.040
the film industry did great during the
depression because people wanted to

40
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.280
escape their life and so they went and
they paid their nickel to see a movie

41
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.280
but one could argue that we've had
escapism for the last 20 years or so um

42
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120
and so what i want to talk about
and we've talked about this ad nauseum

43
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.680
among ourselves and every time we talk
you kind of mentioned the podcast you're

44
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.400
like what are we talking about again um
yeah uh and i'm like james we talk about

45
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.720
this literally all the time i never know
what the hell i'm talking about

46
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.080
like let's run with it take it say it
and the kind of spur thing that spurs

47
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.280
this conversation on and it's we've been
talking about a lot especially since the

48
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.920
batman since we watched the batman the
batman the batman which is now out on

49
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.480
streaming i mean like this batman isn't
much

50
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.120
and he's more like the batman yeah i
love this i love i love patterson

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.799
baderson battinson battenson if you
haven't watched the batman it's totally

52
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.920
worth watching it is long but it's worth
watching it's really it's actually

53
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.879
really good and like i was we were
trying to talk about it and i'm like i

54
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.040
really hope this ushers in an era of
like three-hour thriller movies and you

55
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.560
were like yeah
and well yeah and then we start kind of

56
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.879
started talking about
the cyclical nature of the film yeah

57
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.040
because we're also we also kind of used
that to springboard to talk about not

58
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.480
just like pre-sales for doctor strange
are doing fairly well right uh for imacs

59
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.040
they're doing very well for premium
screens but for normal screens it's just

60
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.560
okay but the batman did the same thing
and then it did really well well as far

61
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.840
as remember it underperformed uh
pre-sales

62
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.040
uh
no okay uh it was doing really badly um

63
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.600
in pre-sales and then
when the movie actually came out it did

64
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.240
better than pre-sales yeah that's what i
mean that's what i mean it did bad

65
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.120
pre-sales and that's the assumption of
what's going to happen with doctor

66
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.040
strange is that the all of the imacs and
the premium screens are selling out

67
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.960
because people like us are buying
tickets because we

68
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.759
have no lives
and

69
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.040
the normal people are waiting for the
reviews to come out

70
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.840
um which i should have waited for the
reviews but i'm sick of like

71
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.600
flurrying about trying to find some
theater with open seats

72
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.080
but like even though pre-sales for
doctor strange are doing fairly well

73
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.759
this isn't getting the same kind of
enthusiasm that other marvel movies get

74
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.240
no they're like there's a sect of marvel
fans that are very excited for it to

75
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.560
stand understand
it's more cautious

76
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.520
curiosity yeah they're very excited
tentatively also yeah tentatively very

77
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.199
excited because it's kind of like
okay are we gonna get the scarlet witch

78
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.880
like at full power [ __ ] yes or are they
gonna do her dirty like marvel normally

79
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.840
does yeah
um

80
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.400
and like that's kind of which era which
era of marvel coming at the scarlet

81
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.960
witch is this yeah and i mean this comes
out tuesday the movie comes out on

82
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.600
thursday so i'm going to put out my
final

83
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.000
prediction and that is that because of
the multiverse there are multiple wandas

84
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.120
and one of them is doing very bad things
and the mcu wanda has to stop them yeah

85
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.400
and i think in the process is going to
have to give up her kids for a second

86
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.039
time yeah
could be the evil one that actually

87
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.520
brings back the kids and good wanda has
to be like this is wrong i shouldn't do

88
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.280
this yeah and so i think that's what's
going to happen with wanda as far as

89
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.800
everything else i don't care
which is like chavez looks like a disney

90
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.880
channel character yeah which is the
thing like people just have seemed to

91
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.440
stop caring about marvel and like same
thing with moon knight same thing with

92
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.600
miss marvel people just aren't buzzing
about it like this the excitement's not

93
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.800
there anymore and i think the the the
default to go to is to say well end game

94
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.880
was the end game and people are having a
hard time kind of getting enthusiasm

95
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.960
yeah the marvel cinematic thing is over
but i want to slap those people because

96
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.639
no no no
because end game came out two years

97
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.400
before one division
and one division had people

98
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.039
very roaming and foaming at the mouth
yeah that me included every week like

99
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.560
it's hard to imagine that it came out
last year new division

100
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.479
two years ago dear no yeah it was last
year yeah last year that's what i mean

101
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.240
like if it was two years ago i'd get it
but like it was last year the series

102
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.720
series was wrapping up yeah and it's
like wow and there was a lot of

103
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.080
excitement for loki a lot of incitement
for loki um

104
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.240
she got some sorry i dropped something i
had a lot of excitement so it's spiders

105
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.680
uh spider-man definitely i don't count
that as an mcu movie i think that's a

106
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.720
uh i'm talking about marvel movies in
general because even like the sony ones

107
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.919
like uh venom has a particular feel um
morby who uh yeah that morbius just

108
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.199
bombed but
but it's kind of like the the assumption

109
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.199
is that you know end game was the end
game and now people are kind of like

110
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.440
well
what happens next you know the

111
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.160
excitement isn't there for the embassy
the evolution of that thinking is like

112
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.759
oh well people are just burnt out from
marvel from last year which may be the

113
00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.160
case
but the thing is

114
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.280
people aren't that excited about
any of the big movies coming out marvel

115
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.280
dress yeah yeah
this is one this is the new top gun the

116
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.759
new um
uh all of these kind of gang buster not

117
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.919
gangbuster but like you know like
blockbuster spectacle films yeah really

118
00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:08.479
playing off that kind of
very strongly interconnected flash and

119
00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.520
shock and awe kind of thing that marvel
kind of established

120
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.560
sit your butt down eat your popcorn
don't pay attent too much attention to

121
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.479
what's actually on the screen kind of
movies yeah um not to say that there

122
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:21.120
wasn't a lot of talent that went into
marvel movies and there aren't some

123
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.440
genuine absolutes in there
but like

124
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.560
was a very fun movie don't think about
it

125
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.959
and the thing is is that like
there's not that much excitement for dr

126
00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.839
strange which i'm finding
kind of odd because of the and i think

127
00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:41.760
that's why the tease is
the the teasers that are going on tv now

128
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.760
are there they're like yeah look it's
captain captain carter look it's

129
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.600
professor x like they're
so they're starting to blow the wad yeah

130
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.560
and i think they're doing that because
the excitement's not there um in the

131
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.440
king community that's called a ruined
orgasm

132
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.120
but they're
you know the excitement isn't there

133
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.360
but the excitement's not really there
for thor either no which is

134
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.959
sad because i was looking more forward
to thor than

135
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:11.360
a lot of other movies yeah um with these
i mean i've lost my excitement for thor

136
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.200
because
crisp

137
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.600
it wasn't for a crisp rat um crisp rat
um

138
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.000
which i think is hilarious that's this
kind of moniker among the queers have

139
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.200
you seen have you seen that mario got
delayed the mario movie not surprised

140
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.800
i'm wondering if they're going if
they're kind of waiting to see what his

141
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.120
movies
are doing

142
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.200
and then kind of me like
because it's not uncommon that they make

143
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.360
announcements for voice casts for like
big animated movies and then just by the

144
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.200
time it comes out it's completely
shifted i mean look at sonic well sonic

145
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.480
got completely the voice cast didn't
change no no i mean just

146
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.560
like making change to animated movies
but like paddington that wasn't an

147
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.680
animated movie but it was an animated
character colin firth was playing

148
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.920
paddington the bear and then
test screenings were like he's kind of

149
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.839
creepy and so they replaced him with um
the guy whose name i can never remember

150
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:09.920
but who i think is really cute plays q
in the new james bond movies ben winshaw

151
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.480
he has that voice yeah i like that yeah
so he was replaced and they replaced

152
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.480
they released um trailers with colin
firth yes yeah so like it's with voice

153
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.560
casting it's literally never too late
yeah it's always easy well i don't know

154
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.920
easy not necessarily but it's never too
late to replace boys yeah yeah um

155
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.839
um even according to george lucas 20
years after the movie's released

156
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.640
but um
yeah so

157
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.760
what we've kind of
talked about a bit and especially like

158
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.600
given that the batman and the reason why
batman is part of this is because it is

159
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.560
such a different superhero movie yeah
it's like it is look at it is a

160
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.399
detective movie with superhero stuff
yeah instead of being a superhero movie

161
00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:00.240
with a detective scene here or there
yeah yeah and

162
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.279
i think this is this is my favorite
batman movie the more i think about it

163
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:08.160
like yes even batman returns
um batman returns might have my favorite

164
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.399
characters and kind of my favorite lines
and like it was a really good script but

165
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.440
just as far as a project came together
this was

166
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.040
yeah
and i think

167
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.279
like the the idea of maybe the
blockbuster is changing a little bit did

168
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.000
come
like we started talking about it after

169
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
seeing the batman but it really got in
ingrained when we saw everything

170
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.519
everywhere all at once which is not a
blockbuster but it's doing very well for

171
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:38.800
the size of the movie that it is yeah
which if you haven't seen it please go

172
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.040
watch it if you have the ability to see
it again i recommend it yeah

173
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.680
um
and

174
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.079
i started thinking about it and because
there are a lot of smaller movies doing

175
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:53.440
very well
and and it's been growing over the last

176
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.959
few years too even before a little bit
before the pandemic like a kind of push

177
00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:02.079
for more personal smaller
uh movie more or our tour kind of films

178
00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:03.920
like um
yeah

179
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.720
um
like the lighthouse for instance the

180
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.200
lighthouse you saw this a lot with
jordan peele um his films like you know

181
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.600
the kind of demand for that uh us and
get out and things like that smaller

182
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.279
budgeted movies
are doing very well

183
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:22.079
and
this happened

184
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.240
you know once before nothing is new
under the sun history repeats itself um

185
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.079
this happened
many times but most distinctly early in

186
00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:35.040
the early 60s because in the 50s when
television started to become a thing

187
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.600
hollywood was like we need to figure out
how to you know out spectacle tv because

188
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.800
if you can just watch stuff at home why
are you going to go to a movie theater

189
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.800
yeah so then went big so they went big
they started doing cinemascope and

190
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.839
things like that which was like ultra
widescreen

191
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:53.360
and that's now we just call
like two three five i shoot a lot of

192
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.880
videos in it but you talk about
cinemascope sometimes it's it's such a

193
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.760
dated term it's very cute when you say
that because you're very like rejected

194
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.240
but there's another one i forget what
it's called i think it might be

195
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.800
cinevision or something like that um
that was basically

196
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.680
three times as wide as the normal screen
and i like the term cinemascope because

197
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.959
it's an ingrained term to sort of say
like you only get this in cinema because

198
00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:18.240
back in the day tvs were basically
squares i think it was like four by

199
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.839
three yeah um so a very
uh tall aspect ratio

200
00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:27.200
um relatively speaking yeah and so
that's when you get movies like if

201
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.560
correct me from like ben hur
uh the ten commandments or those bit

202
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.720
earlier uh the ten commandments i think
was just cinemascope but when you got

203
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.639
into the the other one which i'm calling
it cinevision but it might not be that

204
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:42.639
um
the super super wide screen

205
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.360
that
was the robe

206
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.360
um

207
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.360
a lot of kind of experimental things
like showing you

208
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.519
uh like putting a camera on a roller
coaster and having the roller coaster go

209
00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:00.079
that's interesting because if that's
wide enough that would give you really

210
00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.440
bad vertigo yeah also can you turn my uh
headphones down a little bit just the

211
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.440
headphones um your voice is very loud
sorry no don't don't complain it's just

212
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.000
my headphones are very loud but um is
that better no like a little bit more

213
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.600
just my headphones there how about that
it doesn't seem to be changing that much

214
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.040
maybe we have them in the wrong things
no no anyway just take your headphones

215
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.399
off then okay um that is a little bit
better but

216
00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:29.600
um
but yeah

217
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.440
so
i guess i can take mine off too

218
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.399
um so like things like the robe
and other like ultra widescreen kind of

219
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:43.760
things like ben hur bender was a big one
like these huge spectacle movies uh

220
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.399
spartacus was a really big one um and
there was like a solid 10 years of a lot

221
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:53.199
of these huge budget blockbuster movies
not only like the sound of music was one

222
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:57.199
of them too santa move music was the
first movie with a helicopter on a

223
00:14:57.199 --> 00:15:00.720
camera and a helicopter right i think so
and she kept getting blown over on that

224
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.920
opening seat yes on the hill
but um

225
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.279
so hollywood was like we need to go
bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger bear

226
00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:11.920
but it ended up creating a bubble where
you know you can only go so big yeah and

227
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.399
then
the movies started costing so much money

228
00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:21.360
that cleopatra bankrupted fox well yeah
that's the famous example i think that

229
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.800
what's happened psychologically there is
that p thinks get to a point where

230
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.279
bigness is the only thing that's
really present in the film yeah and like

231
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.160
you don't really see anything else going
on because it's just trying so hard to

232
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.920
be big which once again cleopatra um i
haven't seen the whole movie i've seen

233
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.120
most of it probably mm-hmm uh but
it's big yeah that's what it's supposed

234
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.959
to be first movie where a actor got paid
more than a million dollars

235
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.920
actress
actress okay i thought it was just actor

236
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.639
actress anyone like she was the highest
paid actor i think it was actress but it

237
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:58.240
might be actor okay but
i mean like it's history elizabeth

238
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.480
taylor so like work
so history wise hollywood kind of burst

239
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.680
its bubble
because it was spending so much money on

240
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.839
these movies uh especially musicals
musicals were really big yeah and they

241
00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:13.680
were spending a fortune on movies like
dr doolittle and stuff like this

242
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.079
and no one was going to see them because
people kind of got worn out from the

243
00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:23.120
spectacle yeah and people then started
to go see movies like easy rider bonnie

244
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:29.519
and clyde uh who's afraid of virginia
woolf like movies like that and

245
00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:33.680
and and even like psycho and that kind
of whatever happened whatever happened

246
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.079
to baby jane
is it whatever happened yeah yeah

247
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:39.040
whatever happened to baby james whatever
much smaller movies whatever happened to

248
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.000
mommy dearest um who was afraid of mommy
much much smaller movies and that kind

249
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.519
of
dictated the 1960s

250
00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.399
um
and with everything everywhere all at

251
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:54.320
once which is only
i say only a 25 million dollar movie but

252
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.519
you know by hollywood standards that's
chump change that is tiny especially for

253
00:16:57.519 --> 00:17:00.880
what they pulled off with that 25
million and like the special effects

254
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.440
team was three people
um

255
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.559
a lot of the
like crazy sped up stuff was just a

256
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:11.439
gopro on a stick and the director just
walking around town yeah so

257
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:16.839
i'm i'm wondering if we're not getting
into the situation once again

258
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:23.280
where you where we are
getting that box office fatigue yeah

259
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.799
that blockbuster blockbuster fatigue
yeah and it's not oh the death of the

260
00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:30.080
blockbuster because that happens every
week well yeah it's gonna bounce back

261
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.000
it's just that people i think need a
break from that because i don't even

262
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
think that it's that people need a break
or that people are you know tired of

263
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.360
spectacle it's that
okay show me something new

264
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.320
and like with the mcu you're not really
seeing anything new yeah with um

265
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.400
the dc movies you're not really seeing
anything new because it's all franchises

266
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.400
because hollywood's only willing to put
money into franchises for big budget

267
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.039
movies and so people are like oh i've
seen this before i've seen the marvel

268
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:04.960
movie before because it is the marvel
movie which is why like you know one

269
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.240
division was kind of like a breath of
fresh air because it was

270
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.440
um you know it was such a smaller scope
than marvel's willing to go and even the

271
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.360
marvel has gone
uh in their you know you don't have to

272
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.320
put your headphones back on i was just
putting mine like in their franchises

273
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.000
like um
and so like did one division and and

274
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.679
i
because even when you get into i felt a

275
00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:31.200
little bit i felt really excited by one
division being like oh

276
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.960
the marvel universe is trying something
new yeah and then we got falcon winter

277
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.440
soldier i'm like okay they need to keep
doing the marvel stuff and then we got

278
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.880
loki and then we got and that's what
happened because you got wanda vision

279
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.440
which was like
fresh david lynch does marvel yes and

280
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.880
then you got
um falcon in the winter soldier which is

281
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.520
like okay they're trying this political
thriller thing it's not working yeah but

282
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.960
they're trying it it is something
different but then loki was just a

283
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.200
marvel movie yeah and and then we got
sean then we went back into the marvel

284
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.000
sort of formula and then the movies
started coming out again you got shang

285
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.200
qi and black widow and even though they
were really fun movies and i enjoyed

286
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.440
both of them they were just marvel
movies and then eternals was not a

287
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.880
marvel movie but was also not well
received yeah uh and did not make his

288
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.840
budget back at all no
and

289
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.520
so it's kind of and then but spider-man
then

290
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.480
became one of the highest grossing
movies of all time without even a

291
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.720
chinese release yeah so it's like

292
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:34.240
but then again like like you said about
spider-man spider-man i think is an

293
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.440
outlier in this situation because it was
paying off like it was 20 years 20 years

294
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.640
of spider-man yeah spider-man movies
instead of just adding more to the

295
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.960
marvel cinematic universe yeah gumbo
yeah so and like

296
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.840
and so that's where really where
spiderman uh was why it was such a

297
00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.080
success
oh gosh excuse me um and i mean there's

298
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.840
there's things like hollywood spending
ridiculous amounts of money i think

299
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.480
it's 150 million dollars that they have
given to christopher nolan

300
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.640
to make a movie about the manhattan
project

301
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.919
which if you don't know what the
manhattan project is other than some

302
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:19.039
stock footage of nuclear bombs that
would be required

303
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:24.159
it's people talking in rooms yeah
150 million dollars yeah and i don't

304
00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:27.200
understand that is not going to make its
budget back and that is not going to do

305
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.799
well i don't understand why they keep
throwing him money for these you know

306
00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:35.840
carte blanche projects that don't make
their money back

307
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.159
are they hoping
warner brothers but warner brothers has

308
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:44.960
distanced themselves from him this time
because of

309
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.559
that last one that he did the
not inception

310
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.640
yeah tenant tenant um
they've kind of distanced themselves

311
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.400
from him and he's found a new partner i
think it's sony i can't remember but

312
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.280
he's working with a new production
company now and they just handed him

313
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.960
basically a blank check and he hired
like every actor in hollywood and that's

314
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.840
unfortunate and that's another thing
that's really bothering me about

315
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.919
hollywood is that like these movies are
big movies are becoming basically places

316
00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:16.720
for already popular you know characters
to go like people are kind of factors

317
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.400
actors yeah people are ranking on dune 2
for being like okay it's just collecting

318
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.120
every famous person in hollywood yeah um
and people are kind of annoyed by that i

319
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.840
think people are also entering into an
era where people really like seeing new

320
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.799
faces and fresh perspectives um
like i think one of the reasons people

321
00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:38.799
really liked tom holland when he first
showed up as spider-man is because no

322
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:43.440
one had really seen him before
like unless you had seen the impossible

323
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.799
you didn't know who the hell tom holland
was i think honestly i think that's

324
00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:51.840
another reason why people like uh
pattinson uh as batman because he isn't

325
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.559
like you know he hasn't really been in
the main yeah like he did twilight but

326
00:21:56.559 --> 00:22:01.200
then he's done a bunch of like he kind
of disappeared yeah he didn't he's been

327
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.640
working and doing yeah like kind of
becoming a much the lightning you

328
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.880
mentioned the lighthouse yeah yeah but
he disappeared from mainstream cinema

329
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.640
and then came back and it felt like a
rediscovery

330
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.640
is christian the year after kristen
stewart did uh spencer

331
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.799
same year as spencer okay yeah no the
year after spencer they had an interest

332
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:24.400
spencer was last year yeah yeah that's
what i mean like the year after uh diana

333
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.039
spencer so they both had this
interesting comeback at roughly the same

334
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:30.400
amount of time yeah
one gets to play batman and one gets an

335
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.679
oscar nomination like did she get an
oscar nomination yes i think she did she

336
00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:36.320
didn't win but i think that i did but
she didn't get them off yeah i can't

337
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.559
remember who won
because the oscars were very

338
00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:44.480
not memorable last year yeah which you
know girl maybe it's a good year that

339
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.720
you didn't win uh
um when a year that everyone's gonna

340
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.640
remember um although honestly like will
smith won that's the one that i remember

341
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.559
that's the only one people are yeah
but we're not going to talk about that

342
00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:59.919
we're not going to talk about that but
yeah so like i i

343
00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:04.320
am seeing this i think i'm seeing this
trend happening in hollywood i hope i'm

344
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.600
seeing this trend not in hollywood but
among audiences like in america and

345
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.720
around the world who really want to see
these smaller things well around the

346
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.679
world they uh audiences go for
smaller films all the time that's true

347
00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:19.760
that's big in europe all the time europe
asia everywhere america is the only

348
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.240
place where it's like spectacle
spectacle and china spectacle spectable

349
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.919
spectacle spectacle um
but i'm seeing audiences now

350
00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:33.200
not
taking no like everything everywhere all

351
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.760
at once isn't a 100 million dollar movie
it's not like a huge huge huge huge

352
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.279
crazy out-of-the-box hit yeah but
it is doing incredibly well for itself

353
00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:47.360
over time
and that's kind of saying showing me i

354
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.160
think that audiences
are opening their minds back up to

355
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.520
[Music]
what's out there that's not a franchise

356
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.720
well yeah not to mention we've had two
years of pandemic people are a little

357
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.440
bit fatigued with having turned their
brain off and just you know keeping

358
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.400
netflix going while they're pat while
they pass out on the couch every night

359
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.679
like people i think we're hopefully
entering an era where people actually

360
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:12.080
want to think about the face you made
where people literally fall asleep to

361
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.440
netflix ever
well you do it specifically for i guess

362
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.640
other people do too you don't do it on
the couch though no not on the couch in

363
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.720
my bed uh to grace and frankie which had
his final episodes come out this past

364
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.000
i've been watching bob's burgers so much
i go in your room and you're watching

365
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.320
attack on titan and they're like just
like oh you're a piece of [ __ ] than like

366
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.799
bob's burgers

367
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.799
there's there's going to be a video
coming about attack on titan because i

368
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:40.720
have never watched it before i watched
like five minutes of the first episode

369
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.559
and i was like this is it i feel like i
would need to watch it to sort of help

370
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.679
you with it and i think not watch it but
i think i could read through the omnibus

371
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:51.520
the reason attack on titan kind of um i
have a hard time with that is because it

372
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.240
triggers my horror fears my filter the
gore yeah

373
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.679
it is it is a horror not the thing
really score as much as just the

374
00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:02.159
psychological horror like i have this
one vision ingrained of a titan holding

375
00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:06.559
up a dude he's going to eat and the guy
is just terrified and the the terror is

376
00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:10.080
just perfectly animated yeah and that
has stuck with me over the last like

377
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.919
seven years yeah um and i haven't seen
it's the faces of the titans that do it

378
00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:19.039
for me that i'm like oh it's the fact
that the uh especially in the show react

379
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:22.640
to titans so viscerally i think that's
what gets me more than the titans

380
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.720
themselves yeah and one of the things
like spoiler alert um if you haven't

381
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.440
watched it and you do want to watch it
spoiler one two three four five uh when

382
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.480
you find out that the titans that you
have seen with these extreme faces and

383
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.520
everything
they are normal people that when they

384
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.520
become titans their features are
exaggerated

385
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.440
um
it it makes it even more creepy

386
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.200
because you start to
look at them and you see characters that

387
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.600
you remember from earlier seasons
that are now titans that's interesting

388
00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.880
yeah um like evil titans or like the the
main the the

389
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.520
evil ones the the ones that are
brainless

390
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.720
oh
well that's unfortunate yeah

391
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.159
and like very sad because you met these
characters you knew them and now you

392
00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:13.679
kind of start recognizing their faces oh
that's unsettling yeah uh the whole

393
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:17.200
thing is unsettling um it's super
unsettling i think that's why i like it

394
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.919
because it's like
post-apocalyptic

395
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:24.400
science fiction fantasy horror and i am
totally on board but anyway

396
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.760
um
that

397
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.360
so the the movie thing is something
that's getting me particularly excited

398
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.360
because
if you're listening to this you

399
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.279
obviously know we're starting a
production company surprise well i guess

400
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.520
we've technically started it by now it's
it's the money is in the account the

401
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.799
money is in the bank purchases we are
racking up uh what's it called

402
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:50.400
liquefiable assets
that but it's also been registered

403
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.400
everything the company exists legally
like the whole deal um we'll be shooting

404
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.080
the first movie this summer to come out
in october very excited about that

405
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.080
um
so you know moving forward with that and

406
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.679
so because the movies because we're
working with what is considered micro

407
00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:10.480
budgets
um

408
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.000
like to me i'm like fifteen thousand
dollars is not a micro budget to me but

409
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.679
by hollywood standards it's basically
it's not even it's it's like less than

410
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:21.039
ten million it's basically like

411
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.520
um
and

412
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.720
like
and it's kind of like

413
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.159
it seems like there's an appetite out
there now

414
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:36.720
for smaller movies yeah and movies that
have something to say specifically and

415
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.399
when you have talented people behind the
camera

416
00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:44.720
you can do things for very little money
and

417
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.440
have them kind of make an impact like my
the example i always go to is 28 days

418
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.480
later yeah um i don't know if you've
seen that

419
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.159
but it was filmed on
camcorders

420
00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:59.039
and
like high quality camcorders but still

421
00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:03.360
camcorders they look like camcorders
regardless yeah and but the movie did

422
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.159
extremely well
and

423
00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:09.840
it's because
it was very well made even though it was

424
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.520
made with camcorders yeah and they had i
guess i had very talented people behind

425
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.480
the camera who knew how to use it and
how to kind of work around the

426
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.520
limitations of the camcorder and they
had very talented people in front of the

427
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.480
camera who could sell the horror
regardless of how bad the video quality

428
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.960
looked yeah
um

429
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.880
you know it's telling that when you got
the sequel 28 weeks later it wasn't as

430
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:37.760
successful but it was even though it was
shot you know properly quote unquote um

431
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.159
and you know you get these movies like
paranormal activity and blair witch and

432
00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:46.480
stuff like that that do incredibly well
that cost next to nothing the 90s was

433
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.080
another era that they kind of backed
away from like huge spectacles

434
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.960
absolutely because the 90s really when
the

435
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.120
the only two spectacle movies from the
90s that stick out to me are titanic and

436
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.520
terminator 2. not barbed wire
um

437
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.679
the other movies that stick out to me
from the 90s are like sex lies and

438
00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:11.200
videotape pulp fiction
um you said song slams right clerks yeah

439
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.600
um i i didn't say silence of the lambs
but silence of the lambs wasn't that

440
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.679
small of a budget no uh i mean like it
felt like a small movie though not in

441
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:22.399
comparison that's kind of why i'm
including the batman in this because

442
00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:26.399
it's less about the actual what's being
spent on it and more about the attention

443
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:31.039
to what is on the screen and what is in
the script and what's going and yeah

444
00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:35.760
like with the batman
i kind of wish the end of the movie

445
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.360
didn't have like the big flood and
everything because that pushes it more

446
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.840
into blockbuster territory like i kind
of wish they had kept it on the level of

447
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.120
seven yeah
um like it was a like and when i'm

448
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.919
talking about the size of movement
talking about the scope what is this

449
00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:54.399
movie trying to get across and like the
batman kind of peaked at a terrorist

450
00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:59.679
attack that involved a flood um as
opposed to doctor strange two which is

451
00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:02.799
either of the doctor strange's which is
literal multi multiple dimensions

452
00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.840
colliding
so like that's what i mean in terms of

453
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.960
scope
um yeah it's kind of like um

454
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.360
um

455
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.980
i just had an example but it left my
brain so never mind

456
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.840
[Laughter]
for instance uh

457
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.240
thx uh
the the george lucas movie thx i haven't

458
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.120
seen that uh it was his first movie yeah
uh based on his film school thesis it's

459
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.039
a science fiction film
and you know has the themes and stuff

460
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.720
that you get from things from like 1984
and stuff like that

461
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.880
but on a much smaller scale because you
didn't have a huge budget

462
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.480
and then you have star wars so you have
these two science fiction movies from

463
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.840
the same director
and they are two incredibly different

464
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.200
movies and
both of them came from studios

465
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.279
and
but they're very very different

466
00:30:57.279 --> 00:31:01.360
and so it's kind of like wasn't there
like no music in thx

467
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.360
no i think there was music okay
um

468
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.279
now i can't remember it's been forever
since i've seen it but um did nielsen do

469
00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:14.159
american graffiti that was in between
okay uh which there's plenty of music in

470
00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:17.760
american graffiti yeah plenty of cars
too yeah little known fact about george

471
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.760
lucas i love this is that
he is a car nut and that is why his

472
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.080
spaceships look so cool is because he
designs and they're all named after cars

473
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.880
yeah he designs them to look to kind of
have that feel of like 50s 60s muscle

474
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.320
cars yeah uh he wanted to be a race car
driver when he was younger right yeah

475
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.640
then he got into a car accident and
couldn't keep it up but i i love that

476
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.320
he's just a car not making space movies
yeah he's a car nerd who's just like

477
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.519
because
you i i think there are spaceships in

478
00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:51.840
star wars called cadillacs uh no not
cadillac there are corvettes corvettes

479
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.000
that's it that's the the ten to five
that's a corvette yeah krillian corvette

480
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.440
um
whereas the imperial ships are all named

481
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.120
after um battleships
yeah

482
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.600
um
but yeah so you see this thing kind of

483
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.120
happening with
streaming where now they're all kind of

484
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.840
like oh god what do we do because
you know

485
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.519
the they've kind of hit saturation
um

486
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.919
but now you've got these really small
independent or at least low-budget

487
00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:25.120
filmmakers
coming up who are doing incredibly

488
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.919
interesting things
like you have movies like the witch and

489
00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:33.120
everything everywhere all at once yeah
and stuff like that that are coming out

490
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.600
that are just
so interesting it's it's it's creating

491
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.880
an interesting take that can't really be
quantified which is why i'm kind of

492
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.559
saying talk using scope is this thing
because these are like

493
00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:47.519
you can tell warner brothers was on fire
while they were making the batman

494
00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:50.480
because there was not a student there
was not a producer on set making sure

495
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.799
that what was going on yeah there was no
like person kind of looking over at the

496
00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:58.159
director's shoulder and being like
like looking at the dailies this is too

497
00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:01.360
dark what are you doing you're lighting
the set too dark yeah

498
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.279
it's like that's the point yeah
because you know studios heads don't

499
00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:07.760
really look at it in terms of like a
creative

500
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.799
venture they look at the business
venture they're like i can't see batman

501
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:15.039
why would people want to go see a batman
movie yeah um but you know not seeing

502
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:18.720
batman it turns out is far more
interesting because batman is supposed

503
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.960
to be the shadows yeah
um

504
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.080
but yeah one of the other things that's
happening now

505
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.679
also happened in the 60s
is that there are small independent

506
00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:35.840
production companies popping up right
that are there looking for interesting

507
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.919
filmmakers and interesting ideas like
you give them money like a24

508
00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:43.120
um
and in the early 90s you had things like

509
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.679
miramax did you see the app for that new
uh florence pew movie

510
00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:51.919
um she's starting a movie she's in so
many movies she is kind of she needs to

511
00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.799
be worried because she's hitting a
jennifer lawrence type over saturation

512
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.440
point so
uh she's not quite at jennifer lawrence

513
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.600
yet but she could be yeah like she's in
that direction it's i think it's the

514
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.240
director who did little women uh olivia
someone

515
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.639
she didn't do it little women um
is it the one with harry styles yeah

516
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.159
yeah
harry styles is a gay cop

517
00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.839
he plays a gay cop in like the 50s or
something like that they're married

518
00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:25.280
yeah he plays a bisexual cop oh um
and he has gay sex scenes and stuff in

519
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.480
the movie yeah
that's the big selling point of the

520
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.200
movie is really harry styles has boy
kissing the thing i saw is that he that

521
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.040
wasn't in the trailer i saw it at all at
all

522
00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:40.720
florence pew in here i know he's in a
movie where he plays a queer cop okay

523
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.040
well i think this is not that movie uh
because he is very sexually married to

524
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.760
florence pew and it's very horny um and
matt damon's in it too

525
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.159
it's the victory project i think no it's
called um

526
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:58.400
something something darling don't worry
darling oh i can't remember i'm gonna

527
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.800
look it up i'ma look it up uh my phone's
here that thing's off oh the ipad is

528
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.599
dead and i don't have my laptop here
oh

529
00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.960
talk about stuff now i don't know what
to do

530
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.079
hey audience
no that's not it

531
00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:19.599
it's called don't worry darling trailer
and it's a yeah yeah yeah i think that's

532
00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:24.240
the gay what can i say don't think
that's gay because harry styles was not

533
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.440
doing gay stuff in the trailer and he
did not seem to be a cop he seemed to be

534
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:33.839
like an office worker and this dystopian
step 48 step 40 and kind of thing place

535
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.280
he was not a cop in so far as i saw in
the trailer styles

536
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.560
nope not realm
film

537
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.560
autography

538
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.520
okay
let's see here

539
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.720
filmography

540
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.960
so
okay yeah um the one where he plays the

541
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.920
gay cop is called my policeman okay and
it is a romantic drama film directed by

542
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.079
michael grandage it is based on the
novel of the same name by

543
00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:12.160
bethan roberts
it stars harry styles emma corrin and

544
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.680
david dodd okay anyway the um florence
pew movie don't worry darling is um

545
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.280
it seems like a stepford wives thing but
like with you know interdimensional

546
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.520
[ __ ] which
that's

547
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.880
the trailer's super interesting um
really interesting very kind of cia kind

548
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.720
of um
redacted files kind of thing so yeah i'm

549
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:41.480
interested in seeing that um
and that's um

550
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.960
oh i can't remember her name she was on
house

551
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.040
yeah is directing it i can't remember
her name

552
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.240
olivia someone i think uh we have a
phone right here

553
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.400
olivia something but i can't remember
her last name

554
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.200
for the life of me
olivia wilde olivia wilde yeah

555
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.880
um
but yeah so there's these small

556
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.680
interesting movies coming out from small
interesting directors from small

557
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.119
interesting production companies and the
thing is they look interesting like

558
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:21.760
conceptually they have unique uh feels
whereas like we have had the last 10

559
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.720
years and of just this
kind of um where everything was either

560
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.400
zack snyder mcu or fast and furious yeah
and and so like it was it's v it was

561
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.960
very literally a decade of that just
a lot of visually the same and because

562
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.280
like when you boil it down zack snyder
is only tandentally different than the

563
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.800
scope of marvel movies yeah and the
decade before that everyone was trying

564
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.000
to be michael bay yeah so this has been
20 years of these massive spectacle

565
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.960
movies trying to you know um have
distinct explosions without actually

566
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.079
themselves looking distinct i remember
when um fury road came out people were

567
00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:02.320
saying it just looks like michael bay
explosion and you literally were

568
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.440
everywhere on twitter being like um no
um george miller explosion frank miller

569
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.800
who which one which dweller george
miller george miller explosions are

570
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.960
different than michael bay explosions
and they were because they were actually

571
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.640
real explosions a lot of michael bay
explosions are real explosions really um

572
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.400
the difference is george miller was
perfectly fine blowing up cameras to get

573
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.520
those explosions
that's true michael daise's michael

574
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.280
bay's michael bay is a numbers guy
um yeah at the same time is also under

575
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.160
the impression that he is an artor
filmmaker um yeah

576
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.960
but we're not going to talk about that
um

577
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.520
uh so like it's interesting to i i'm
really curious to see whether it is like

578
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.960
marvel fatigue whether it's blockbuster
fatigue or whether people just want

579
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.040
something that's a little bit more
smaller and more cerebral from their

580
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.400
cinematic uh experiences well yeah
because

581
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.000
you would think
that after being stuck at home for two

582
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.240
years
and watching netflix shows

583
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.880
you would be like i want something big i
want spectacle i want bombastic

584
00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.880
craziness
but that doesn't seem to be what's

585
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.200
happening now the summer movie season is
not even getting started yet uh it

586
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.960
doesn't get started until
actually it gets started this weekend

587
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.960
with doctor strange um so it's kind of
like we'll see

588
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.760
what happens with the summer movie
season and if people really are kind of

589
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.160
going for just the the typical big giant
movies or if they're

590
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.760
for the first time in a long time is
bandwidth for these smaller movies to

591
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.760
actually get a foothold and get a fan
base yeah because if there is then

592
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.000
there's a whole generation of filmmakers
that can come up from that yeah and i'm

593
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.680
really excited to see that too
just because like i i think i've gotten

594
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.240
kind of sick of the blockbuster i think
i've gotten kind of worn out of like

595
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.040
that kind of
overlit

596
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.320
uh oh the over-lit stuff yeah the
over-lit

597
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:07.040
the universe is in peril oh god what do
we do like it's just sky beam it just

598
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.800
it just seems like the same thing yeah
and it's like not like the rest of

599
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.040
marvel where it was building to
something we don't know what this is

600
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.640
building towards yet and so it just
seems like the same

601
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.240
and i think marvel is too a great
ingrained and i didn't mind the marvel

602
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.640
formula what was happening because i
understand that it was building to

603
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.640
something longer term but well we knew
it was building yeah to the thanos stuff

604
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.119
and so now we didn't know that in the
first phase but then again people hadn't

605
00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:34.079
really caught on to the marvel formula
in the first phase well yeah and the

606
00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:37.839
first phase also wasn't that it was
successful but it wasn't that successful

607
00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:42.640
thor captain america hulk for sure
weren't huge movies and so like this is

608
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.760
what i mean by like big budget movies
and it's like we got the batman out of

609
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.680
this is like the big budget movies
they all had that kind of paint by

610
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.880
numbers feel
uh because because they are paint by

611
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.480
numbers because they're kind of decided
by executives because executives have

612
00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.040
decided this format was successful here
so it must be successful everywhere and

613
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.920
so that's why smaller movies are
becoming such a prominent thing is

614
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.960
because it's
budgets that are too small for stu for

615
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.720
producers to be find it worth their time
to micromanage yeah because if you have

616
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.200
you know if you give
a director a a jordan peel for instance

617
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.640
if you give him 15 million dollars to
make a movie

618
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.480
to me that you know to most people 15
million dollars sounds like a fortune

619
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.160
but to a movie executive it's like oh
yeah that guy over there has 15 million

620
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.640
dollars to make a movie this guy has 200
million and i need to keep an eye on him

621
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.920
yeah the first guy's a tax write-off if
it doesn't work off no big deal yeah

622
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.720
whereas the other guy is you know my
career yeah um and so you know they'll

623
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.640
micromanage the big movies which is they
kind of let the smaller movies go which

624
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.839
is why the first it for instance did
really really really well and the second

625
00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:50.480
one didn't because that's when the
studios realized this is the cash cow

626
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.319
well yeah the studio was warner brothers
was like okay it needs to have this and

627
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:57.200
this and this and this and this and this
and we have to hit this and this and

628
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.760
this and it's like okay now your movie's
three hours long yeah

629
00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:08.160
really like arbitrary kind of additions
to it uh based on what i've heard i

630
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.720
haven't watched a horror movie in my
life yeah the first it was so

631
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.800
well made and so tightly made and just
because it's so good

632
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.880
it let itself be raw
like it let itself just be

633
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.640
this kind of horrifying messy mess of
stuff whereas like and i mean that in a

634
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.359
nice way like it was raw as in like it
went raw like it went hard it went like

635
00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:36.560
the scariest part of the second it movie
was at the very beginning when the gay

636
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.680
guy gets murdered
because it was like

637
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.839
really real
and then pennywise eating him and stuff

638
00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:48.079
like that was terrifying but then when
it and not just because i'm gay but

639
00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:51.839
because it just felt
you don't see that

640
00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:56.880
um that visceralness
and it was very visceral you don't see

641
00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.640
that in a lot of horror movies
but then the rest of the movie just

642
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.800
became
okay let's hit the beats

643
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.720
and
the first movie i found was closer to

644
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.440
that visceral nature and maybe it's
because it's kids and you know

645
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.040
child characters in horror movies i
watched i could not watch the trailers

646
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.240
for the first it movie without getting
nightmares the second trailer no the

647
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.960
second the trailer for the second movie
they felt it felt much less and that's

648
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.119
what i mean like it was
oh yeah there was more polish there and

649
00:43:29.119 --> 00:43:32.800
like i feel like horror comes from
things being unpolished and

650
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.440
unquantifiable and undefinable and
obscured and so like the film like i

651
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.880
said like this executive why do people
want to go see a batman movie where you

652
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.920
don't see batman
and that's that's that's a very good

653
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.319
point um because the horror movies that
become the biggest hits

654
00:43:48.319 --> 00:43:51.280
are the low budget ones
because

655
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:57.280
a horror movie shouldn't feel polished
and when you start to get things being

656
00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.640
really successful and you start to get
big money behind them like i think the

657
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.119
second it movie was like a
it was it was it wasn't like you know

658
00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:09.040
200 million but it was high for a year
um

659
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.240
it had polish to it
which doesn't in my opinion doesn't work

660
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.359
with horror movies yeah because when
what i mean what do we mean by polish is

661
00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:21.680
like a kind of smoothness like
smoothness where things are explained

662
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.920
things are qualified things are clear um
where a lack of clarity i think is

663
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.760
the reason why the first it did so
did so well because like there was a

664
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.000
bunch of unanswered questions a lot of
ambiguity and because the creators were

665
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.280
like the the details aren't important
yeah uh this is about a cosmic fear

666
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.000
monster yeah um and if we explain it as
a cosmic fear monster it's not as scary

667
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.560
anymore yeah and i know there's somebody
listening who's saying what about scream

668
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.200
scream is not a horror movie
in my opinion it's a slasher movie but

669
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.599
it's closer to
uh agatha christie

670
00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:02.560
than
the last house on the left

671
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.720
and
so or like texas chainsaw massacre or

672
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.880
something like that it's much more of a
murder mystery all of them examples the

673
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.760
28 days later is unpolished and raw or
very 28 weeks later is incredibly

674
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.760
polished very and that's why it was
boring because like the polish meant

675
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.920
that it had to fit certain beats by
traditional filmmaking when the polish

676
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.560
is there you know you're watching a
movie so it's not scary oh that's

677
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.480
another way whereas when it's kind of
messy

678
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.599
you almost feel like you're watching
footage yeah and well uh blair witch

679
00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:40.240
project well blair witch project is a
good example but you know there

680
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.839
horror really got a lot out of the found
footage thing yeah but like you can do a

681
00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:50.720
normal narrative movie that feels very
cinema verite that is a horror movie and

682
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.359
it works sound footage like i want to
sort of talk about like i i

683
00:45:55.359 --> 00:46:00.240
i didn't mind cloverfield
um but i felt like it was trying too

684
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.720
hard to be found footage movie
in terms of cloverfield was basically i

685
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.319
i liked it because it was taking the
idea of the found footage movie blair

686
00:46:08.319 --> 00:46:13.040
witch project paranormal activity
and taking it to the blockbuster extreme

687
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.839
what i didn't like about it is like
the explanation why are you filming this

688
00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:22.800
um how is this footage compiled these
questions weren't really answered and

689
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.599
even though
and like the thing that i that really

690
00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:28.319
bothered me the most about that is that
they're going through like the military

691
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:32.720
base in the and the um
in the and they don't take the camera

692
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.560
from it and they don't first of all they
don't take the camera second of all just

693
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.359
perfectly she pans over to see her
friend explode in the uh behind the

694
00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:45.920
curtain um and it's like
i think it's a guy whoever was filming i

695
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.079
think it was multiple filmers and i'm
like once again how did you compile this

696
00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:55.200
yeah um
and like like it it just fit those it

697
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.760
just hit those beats yeah uh where it's
like okay it fit those filmographic

698
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.920
beats and it felt like a film yeah uh
whereas like blair witch project didn't

699
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.560
give a flying [ __ ] if the camera wasn't
pointed at what it needed to be yeah um

700
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.359
it was like okay you didn't quite see
that it's obscured in the shadows great

701
00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:16.960
like yeah and that was why it was more
terrifying like the kids laughing in the

702
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.359
[ __ ] woods um
and so like and like you know film nerds

703
00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:25.200
are gonna be like uh the blair witch
project wasn't the best found footage

704
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.400
film it's like okay but i have a very
limited frame of reference for horror

705
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.839
movies well i mean
saying it's the best or not the best is

706
00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:35.200
so completely subjective
um

707
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.240
like i don't know where it stacks up in
terms of like you know the um the kind

708
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.640
of genre but yeah and so that's what i
mean by i think it is clover field was

709
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.319
polished where everything was project
was not

710
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:51.119
i think the first paranormal activity
is on par with blair witch but i think

711
00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:56.960
everything else is imitating them
uh like i have an idea for a fan footage

712
00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.920
horror movie where it's kind of nature
people and they're going out and so

713
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.640
they've got gopros strapped to their
heads because you see that a lot with

714
00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.640
like um hardcore sports and stuff like
that oh that'd be fun and that way it's

715
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.599
like
in the story explanation for why there

716
00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:15.760
is a camera on everybody's head
and you can cut between them and it all

717
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.520
makes sense
and that way it's not just oh i'm just

718
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.119
gonna film my friend being killed this
would be super gimmicky and you can do

719
00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:28.079
this only on like a streaming service is
if the viewer can flip between the four

720
00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:32.240
different perspectives um when they want
that might have been done i think it

721
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.119
might have been done but i think it
could be fun for horror because then it

722
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:38.559
means like oh you weren't watching the
right screen when this happened oh my

723
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:41.119
god flick to that screen oh my god
there's something happening on this one

724
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:44.160
yeah so it'd like be worth kind of
re-watching it to kind of deconstruct it

725
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.200
that way uh like if there's three or
four of them yeah if there's like four

726
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.520
streams and you can flick between them
and then like you can kind of

727
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.480
artificially get your numbers up because
people will go back and watch the movie

728
00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:01.400
again to see the other side of things
especially if one of them is the killer

729
00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:04.960
uh so that's that's settling in by
polish and that's why

730
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.920
the batman was not polished there's here
here's my cause there's polish and

731
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.480
there's experimental
and

732
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:19.040
experimental isn't like david lynch it's
there's a filmmaker who is cutting their

733
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.200
teeth
and then

734
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.160
polished is there's a filmmaker who has
been given money

735
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.839
and with that money they have you know
the best cinematographer the best

736
00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:33.119
everything and so everything is much
more

737
00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:37.119
some would argue
was where tim burton failed

738
00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:40.800
absolutely as a director the more
polished he got the more he stopped

739
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.960
caring about making things
function after mars attacks it was

740
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.839
downhill there's a bit of a pickup for
sweeney todd and then back down as for

741
00:49:49.839 --> 00:49:55.599
in my opinion i don't think that's um an
opinion that is unshared yeah um sweeney

742
00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:58.160
todd i know there's a lot of people who
hate mars attacks but i think it's

743
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.880
hilarious good because
i i i we were watching listening to some

744
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.119
film people talk uh i think it was
lindsay actually uh listening to some

745
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:13.040
film people yeah and her friend on the
musical explaining uh talked about

746
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.119
willie wonk with the willy wonka the
bird willy wonka and he said like that

747
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:22.160
felt like it was the last time that
tim burton and friends had fun on a

748
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.839
movie
yeah

749
00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:27.200
and it's like
that checks out

750
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.520
yeah
um

751
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.599
because like alice in wonderland didn't
even feel like a tim burton was soulless

752
00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:38.640
yeah it's completely soulless uh corpse
bright even soulless well corpse bride

753
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.800
was very much just seemed to me like
trying to recreate nightmare before

754
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.640
christmas
yes but doing it without anything it was

755
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.559
you know
corpse bride very polished uh because

756
00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:54.000
they had they and that's the thing with
night before before christmas they had

757
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.680
to make do with what they can so it's
like okay we've only got this let's find

758
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.440
a way to make this work regardless
whereas like polish seems to be

759
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.680
depending on elements of the film
structure the cost depending on the

760
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.359
costume depending on the set i mean
depending on the polish is good oh yeah

761
00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:12.400
i'm not saying it's bad but i'm sort of
saying like you know they're

762
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.160
like and here's another good example
the hobbit versus the lord of the rings

763
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.079
ah
yeah the hobbit is so polished it has a

764
00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:24.400
sheen to everything whereas the lord of
the rings is dirty

765
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.160
and like the lord of the rings cost you
know almost i think was 250 million

766
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.040
dollars to make like it they spent 18
months shooting it it is the definition

767
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.640
they all made a billion dollars 120
oscars 20 or 18. um like it is the

768
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.599
definition of blockbuster cinema
but when you watch it

769
00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:47.440
it's really you feel like you're there
there's this roughness to it

770
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.880
yeah whereas when you watch the hobbit
it feels like everything is plastic it's

771
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.440
yeah that's what i mean like it feels
like everything i

772
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.119
perfect example if you've ever driven
through perth ontario you know exactly

773
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:03.760
what polish looks like it it polishes
like it's like a polished handcrafted

774
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.160
versus one that's 3d printed
yes and i was going to say polish looks

775
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:13.359
feels like a miniature diorama where
everything is placed just so

776
00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:17.599
you're creating the idea of a film
you're creating the idea of a mate of a

777
00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:22.559
gore street in perth ontario um
uh gore street sounds like a horror

778
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:26.960
movie uh the main street of perth
ontario is gore street fourth street i

779
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.000
[ __ ] hate that place
um

780
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.319
like this is what i mean like perth
ontario when you're driving through it

781
00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:37.680
it feels like it's trying to convince
you that this is what a small town is

782
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.400
like
um and regardless of the fact that it is

783
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.440
in fact a small town yeah you've been
there well i've been there but there's a

784
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.559
lot of places from where i'm from where
like the town is obviously not you know

785
00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:53.599
small town usa or anything yeah but
there are parts of it that are trying to

786
00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:56.720
look that way yeah and like because
perth are trying to look like they

787
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:03.280
popped out of a 1950s sitcom perth is um
uh it's got that main drag it's built on

788
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.440
a river so it's very picturesque there's
a clock tower on the city hall uh

789
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:12.480
gorgeous parks around all of the light
posts on the main street have flower

790
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.839
planters there are flower planters every
few

791
00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:20.319
every couple dozen meters on the main
street uh all of the shop fronts are

792
00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:23.119
very just so
um

793
00:53:23.119 --> 00:53:27.200
like templated yes and that's what i
mean like it feels

794
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.720
so polished and it's like this is so
polished it can't be real this doesn't

795
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.200
occur naturally it's trying to convince
you that this is

796
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.839
you know something
um

797
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:41.359
uh that just occurs naturally it's
trying to convince it's very stepford

798
00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:45.760
it's there to convince city people that
this is a small town yeah um with small

799
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.520
town living and small town amenities
small town values even though it is not

800
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.440
there are stores in perth that people
will drive from toronto which is four

801
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.000
hours away um to go to and then drive
back to toronto because it offers things

802
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.680
that you can't get in the city and or
any small town uh it's a store called

803
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.160
foodsmiths it's a natural holistic food
store um they get things in that are

804
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.680
almost impossible to get i would think
you could get anything in toronto

805
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.160
maybe things have changed toronto uh
toronto um

806
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:19.680
but yeah so like it's it's
it is a small town but it is trying to

807
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.040
fit your it's trying to meet your
archetypical

808
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.079
uh platonic ideal of what a small town
is and that's what yeah it's it's that

809
00:54:28.079 --> 00:54:32.559
rockwell image of what assault yeah yes
rockwell polish

810
00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:36.160
um
and so like there is merit to that i

811
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.599
mean like
um you want to look at uh you know as

812
00:54:39.599 --> 00:54:44.799
another example lady gaga's early career
she was using polish as an artistic tool

813
00:54:44.799 --> 00:54:49.280
to kind of create commentary about the
industry of music and about the creative

814
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:54.000
process and about stardom and she was
using and she was making sure every uh

815
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.280
her stuff fit those kind of elements of
polishedness

816
00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.240
because as long as it fit those criteria
she could do whatever the [ __ ] she

817
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:04.480
wanted and she kind of realized this uh
in her early career and she made it big

818
00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:10.160
off of that and now she's doing
something um i guess

819
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.680
um
i feel like after

820
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.920
born this way she kind of
lost track of her ability to kind of

821
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.640
create these creative personas i think
it's very clear when gaga can do

822
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.040
something that she wants to do and
something she feels like she has to do

823
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:33.920
yeah like the video for um 9-1-1 9-1-1
was something she wanted to do yeah

824
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.200
whereas the video for the one that came
before that

825
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.760
the one that was shot on an iphone uh
that wasn't the one before that because

826
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.040
the one before that was uh right on me
with ariana grande uh which seemed like

827
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.400
a fun time yeah the first one that came
out the one that was in the desert that

828
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.280
one um that felt like a bit of a chore
that felt like that was

829
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:57.280
sold to her by producers and apple yeah
um to say like make a video with our

830
00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.280
iphones and we will pay for it she's
like okay i have to do this now yeah and

831
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.880
like that kind of they wanted the most
upbeat song and that started to

832
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.559
come about uh in her uh born this way
music video run especially when she got

833
00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:15.040
you know bullied out of the idea the
concept she had for edge of glory yeah

834
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.520
uh and with the by the director
mysterious drama she had with artpop

835
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.839
regarding her injury and her manager
somehow betraying her to the extent that

836
00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:26.480
she fired him and make it made a huge
deal about it

837
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.599
uh that i haven't really heard anything
about that yeah um so yeah like whereas

838
00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:36.240
you know like lady gaga unpolished is
joanne uh lady gaga unpolished is cheek

839
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.640
to cheek it's cheek to cheek not
necessarily the second one the second

840
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.839
one felt much more polished i felt
because they you know they had to kind

841
00:56:41.839 --> 00:56:45.119
of keep the pulp put the polish in there
because tony bennett because kind of was

842
00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:48.319
slipping yeah slipping a little bit
that's a good phrase uh but cheek to

843
00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:53.599
cheat was very raw um to the point where
i would hear lady gaga and or tony

844
00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:58.319
messing up lyrics now and then yeah um
and at points like they would laugh and

845
00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:01.839
you're like yeah that's not scripted
yeah and that happens i listen to a lot

846
00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:05.040
of jazz music that happens all the time
yeah because they record these live the

847
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.960
whole band everyone uh maybe they throw
in an instrument or two afterwards in

848
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.680
post but uh and they do that so they can
get these kind of really fun um

849
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.839
spontaneous interactions yeah um and
spontaneous that's another kind of way

850
00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:21.920
to sort of
say an antithesis to polish

851
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.240
yeah because especially with filmmaking
when you're doing a movie that's 200

852
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:33.920
million dollars when you show up to set
you have a list for every single shot

853
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.280
that's going to happen that day and
there is no changing it yeah whereas

854
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.000
apparently that's doubly true with
marvel movies people have talked about

855
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.119
everyone shows up they know they're
lying it's it's not like pirate six

856
00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:47.119
everyone shows up they know they're
lying nobody has your pieces

857
00:57:47.119 --> 00:57:52.640
uh important i feel bad about johnny
depp i do i i mean i i say that somewhat

858
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.319
sympathetically because i get like i
want him to do another pirates movie i

859
00:57:56.319 --> 00:58:00.480
want him to get clean and do another
pirates movie to kind of show everyone

860
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.520
that i'm still i'm sad we didn't get to
see him build up to be grindelwald for a

861
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.559
number of reasons i feel like that is
something that he would have built up to

862
00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:12.559
over over the next next few movies
before we really got to see what he was

863
00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:15.040
kind of planning well there's not gonna
be any more movies than that there's not

864
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.240
gonna be any more movies from that and
we didn't get to see that begin with and

865
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.599
you know johnny depp can do better yeah
um i forget where i was the petition to

866
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:28.720
remove amber heard from uh aquaman has
reached three million signers they cut

867
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.559
her down to i think ten minutes
uh but i can't i can't remember what i

868
00:58:32.559 --> 00:58:37.839
was saying now um
but right so so so like

869
00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:41.280
the it is a machi when the bigger the
movie the more likely it is to be a

870
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.400
machine and smaller movies you show up
and the actors actually have the

871
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.119
opportunity to come to the director and
say like

872
00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:53.280
what if we did this or what if like i
said this instead of this and there can

873
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:58.799
be some you know creativity
uh spontaneous creativity on the set

874
00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:03.040
whereas when you've got a 200 million
dollar movie and you've got you know 500

875
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.359
people on set and you've got if someone
goes you've got producers on set

876
00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:12.559
literally looking at their watch going 5
000 10 000 15 000. like if someone goes

877
00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:16.480
off script that disrupts the entire day
so yeah because if someone doesn't hit

878
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.079
their mark if someone says a line that's
not like that can just mess everything

879
00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:21.680
up
and

880
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:26.319
you know sometimes directors who do have
a lot of sway can can like taiwa for

881
00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:30.079
instance he can make a 200 million
dollar movie that does have some oh yeah

882
00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:33.280
like improvisation i think chris
hemsworth got a lot of improvised lines

883
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.119
on the right
that entire right loki become like um

884
00:59:37.119 --> 00:59:40.880
picking up the snake scene i picked up a
snake and look he became sick and ah

885
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.480
yeah that was improv so that was like
legit reactions and funny you mentioned

886
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.280
taiga with td because uh we watched what
we do in the shadows lately yeah uh

887
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.680
which not movie but you know we're at
the point where we've talked about i've

888
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.000
seen the movie but you haven't right
yeah this we we meant the tv show yeah i

889
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.720
meant the tv show
um and like if we were weeing all over

890
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.400
us the strange thing about that is that
you know aja is this you know

891
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.280
mediterranean island character
nausea nausea uh this mediterranean

892
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.839
character she will sometimes slip into
this random british

893
01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:17.119
accent why is that like she must be
british why are they keeping these cuts

894
01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:20.720
in we learned it's because like only
about 90 percent of that show is

895
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.880
scripted the rest is just the character
only about 10 of that show is scripted

896
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.880
well more than 10 but like a huge
portion of the show is unscripted and so

897
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.040
it's just these characters interact like
these actors in character interacting

898
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.799
with things and so even though it's a
show that is obviously designed because

899
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.200
you have character you have special
effects happening you have characters

900
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.079
flying and everything yeah that turning
into even though it has to be you know

901
01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:47.119
polished because when you have that kind
of stuff happening people can get

902
01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:50.319
injured so you have to make sure that
it's safe

903
01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:54.319
it's there's still this spontaneity and
messiness to it

904
01:00:54.319 --> 01:01:00.480
that just makes it feel real yeah and
fun yeah like but i feel like if that

905
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.680
i've actually heard a rule of comedy
like the more jokes you script than not

906
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.359
it's not you're you're the less funny it
is yeah um that's especially true when

907
01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:10.960
you're emceeing if you don't ever script
your joke if you have if you are invited

908
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.640
to mc something don't script your jokes
uh riff on your own content while you're

909
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.760
on stage yeah
um

910
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.160
and i've seen what happens when you
don't do that

911
01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:26.030
dead air
every season on drag race

912
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:30.240
[Laughter]
there is somebody who just it's like

913
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.040
stop
you're not funny stop

914
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.040
but yeah back to hollywood um or the
lack thereof

915
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.040
um
i'm really excited by at the prospect of

916
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.559
what's going on
the prospect of it well hopefully it'll

917
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:50.799
open some doors for telos
i feel like there are more doors shut

918
01:01:50.799 --> 01:01:54.000
for telos just because of the gay thing
well yeah oddly i feel like heart

919
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.200
stopper is opening more doors for telos
than anything else because people are

920
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.920
like
oh you can have a gay thing and it

921
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.680
doesn't have to be about
gay bashing or aids or

922
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.520
you know trauma of any sort it's like no
people actually and not just gay people

923
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.720
just people
enjoy they are perfectly fine like i

924
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.440
said from the beginning people don't
really care about what they're watching

925
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.559
they just care that what they're what
they're watching is good yeah and you

926
01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:21.680
know
people can only take so much depressing

927
01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.520
[ __ ]
and when every gay thing

928
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.119
even when it's like a lighthearted
comedy kind of thing like love simon

929
01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:31.760
it's like
there's the

930
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.599
there's so much stress and anxiety in
the movie

931
01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:41.200
and then in heart stopper there's really
not and people are so in love with it

932
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.520
because of that
and

933
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.680
i think that's opening doors for queer
media that weren't there before and i

934
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.640
think there's the possibility
that telos might be popping up at the

935
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.720
perfect time yeah so kind of hit this
kind of perfect storm of like you know a

936
01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.200
growing audience curiosity i think it's
not a demand i think we're still in the

937
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.480
curiosity phase like i'm curious about
experiencing

938
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.960
more
gay media

939
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.000
um
especially because

940
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.119
60 of gen y
identifies as some flavor of queer wait

941
01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:18.880
is gen y the one after us
those are zoomers

942
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.799
no that's gen z
maybe it's gen z that i'm thinking of

943
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.599
yeah cause jen where's supposedly gen y
okay it's the one after millennials yeah

944
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:32.319
um it's like 50 or 60 percent identify
as some flavor of queer

945
01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:36.480
and so it's like
that is a huge audience coming up

946
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.119
that doesn't have
media made for it yeah

947
01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:45.359
but and honestly like in the
the discussion of polish versus then

948
01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:49.359
polish media i don't really trust
studios gonna deliver that earnestly

949
01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:53.760
absolutely not because it's going to be
so polished that it's going to be

950
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.359
depicting a limited and i've kind of
railed like used your videos to kind of

951
01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:01.680
scream into the void uh sorry i use you
uh

952
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.400
i know um
like you know kind of talking about like

953
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.880
um when it comes to money men
there's only going to be a limited

954
01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.520
availability of queer identities that
they're going to willing to describe

955
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.160
display um
and you know of those identities there's

956
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.240
only a limited number of reflections
that those people are going to be like

957
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.599
for instance and this is probably a good
way to bring the this episode to a close

958
01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:31.119
do you think
if everything everywhere all at once had

959
01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:34.880
been a 200 million movie
they ever

960
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.039
would have let
the

961
01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:40.720
villain of the movie be a lesbian
absolutely not

962
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.920
never never because they would have
looked at it and said the gays will come

963
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.680
for us she can't be a lesbian yeah
they're vilifying gay people we can't do

964
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.319
this anymore and then you lose an
interesting queer character of color

965
01:04:52.319 --> 01:04:58.079
yeah oh that i i have said that movie i
have so so much reverence for that movie

966
01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:02.160
um i have reverence for everyone on set
i i loved the entire cast jimmy i've

967
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.640
watched so many direct so many
interviews with the daniels the

968
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.119
directors and i'm just like they seem so
like so much fun i want to hang out with

969
01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:11.440
them
i just

970
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.839
jamie lee curtis yes jamie yeah jamie
curtis she she was

971
01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:19.520
you can tell he doesn't watch horror
movies i no i just had a brain fart uh

972
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.799
she was just so fantastic i i i love
that she went ugly as she did um yeah

973
01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:28.400
with the like the gut and everything
yeah and then the ultimate universe uh

974
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.760
sausage
um the sauce hot hot dog fingers

975
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.880
uh lesbian romance i'm like jamie you
don't got a a gut you're the activia

976
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.520
lady she is the activity lady uh this is
this is the ultimate version of jamie

977
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.240
lee curtis where she was not the
activity yeah where she doesn't eat

978
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.359
activia
and so she has a lot of bad gut bacteria

979
01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:52.000
but she does have dildo awards to make
up for it but plug awards

980
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.640
yes she does

981
01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.480
people listening to this movie are like
what is going on

982
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:05.119
what is going on with this movie
but yeah so what do you guys think do

983
01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:08.480
you think that there is
an opening

984
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.640
now
for

985
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.799
more interesting smaller movies that
wasn't there before the people are kind

986
01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:17.440
of
being a bit more open-minded and they're

987
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.000
not just going to movies that are
kind of

988
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.240
the the swanson's tv dinner of cinema
that's where they know exactly what

989
01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.319
they're getting yeah um you know it's
not the big mac of movies or do you want

990
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.839
the chef special yeah where it's just
like i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm

991
01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:37.599
gonna get but let's see
and

992
01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:41.119
you know so do you think that's
happening or do you think it's that

993
01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:45.359
you know
it's really just gonna go back to boring

994
01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:49.280
one thing i'm worried about is that
we're going to have a couple like not so

995
01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.440
great smaller movies that get over hyped
because movie tickets are more expensive

996
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.640
than they ever have been you know
relative to

997
01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.000
you know the you know cost of living and
stuff um i think uh like it completely

998
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.640
depends on where you yeah
in some areas they're getting very

999
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.799
inaccessible uh some areas still don't
have well like the average price of a

1000
01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:13.039
movie ticket in new york is 25 that's
ridiculous so like you know like people

1001
01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:16.640
it's still 10 bucks here and my thought
process about that was like people go to

1002
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.960
see spectacle movies that they can't see
content of on go streaming because like

1003
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.559
i i have 20 bucks to spend on this movie
i'm going to spend it on something

1004
01:07:24.559 --> 01:07:29.359
that's going to be a popcorn flick um
so i think that the price of movie ticks

1005
01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:33.680
is is also going to impact
um

1006
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.240
that's like bad food because it's just
gone the next day

1007
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240
i know um and i think people are maybe
people have realized you know like i'm

1008
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.640
not going to spend 25 bucks on a movie
that i've seen 20 times whereas i think

1009
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.240
people who go see everything everywhere
all at once they're talking about it for

1010
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.920
weeks after yeah it only had a three
percent drop last week

1011
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.400
yeah it's been doing great and usually
every week after a movie is released it

1012
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.799
drops um
50 to 70 the bigger movies yeah the

1013
01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:07.760
bigger movies the smaller of the box
office gross the smaller the drop but

1014
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.359
like three percent is like a yeah that's
yeah that's that's pretty because it

1015
01:08:11.359 --> 01:08:14.480
hasn't been introduced in more theaters
than it has been yeah i think it's in

1016
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.640
like two thousand theaters now um
because i saw someone complaining the

1017
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.839
week uh after after everything was
really everything everywhere was

1018
01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:25.600
released they were saying they were so
salty they couldn't see it because their

1019
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.960
movie theater was still showing
spider-man

1020
01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.759
yeah and so like you know like it
our movie theaters also need to start

1021
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:37.920
you know taking
you know bets on smaller movies um

1022
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.440
smaller studios need to be willing to
distribute more far and wider but i

1023
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.040
think you know like if they kind of have
these very well smaller studios what

1024
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.440
they do is they release it in
a couple of theaters

1025
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.400
like between one and ten cause i
remember we didn't even get the first

1026
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.319
wave of everything everywhere well it's
because it's released in like one to ten

1027
01:08:56.319 --> 01:09:00.880
theaters and then they release it in
usually about

1028
01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.880
one to fifty
and then up to five hundred

1029
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.759
and then when it gets to a thousand we
get it

1030
01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:10.319
but
most people don't get it until it gets

1031
01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:14.640
to 2500 to 3000 theaters
um

1032
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.000
like especially if you live in a small
town you're not getting it until it

1033
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.279
reaches like ultra wide
release and i'm interested to see people

1034
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:26.239
are how especially like back on topic
for doctor strange and everything

1035
01:09:26.239 --> 01:09:29.120
everywhere how are people going to
compare

1036
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.239
the multiverseness in doctor strange
versus everything everywhere well the

1037
01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:36.560
thing is

1038
01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:39.839
because we've already had a lot of
multiverse content from marvel and is

1039
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:43.040
like is doctor strange going to be the
same thing oh no the multiverse is at

1040
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.880
stake from ambiguous monster thing like
different i i think the exciting i i

1041
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.319
don't know
we'll find out we will find out we'll

1042
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:55.199
probably be talking about it on next
week's episode we might have a special

1043
01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:58.320
yeah yeah oh god i'm so nervous about
this

1044
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.560
i am so nervous about this i
we one division wasn't even done and i

1045
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.199
was nervous about this like yeah i have
so many feelings about the scarlet witch

1046
01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:12.080
wrapped up in this and i am so tired
okay so

1047
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.400
what do you guys think do you think
hollywood is going to open its eyes and

1048
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.159
start experimenting again or do you
think that they're just going to keep

1049
01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:24.000
doing these gigantic movies that are
like

1050
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.800
you know
bad

1051
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.760
food that's just gone the next day and
you forget about it they're just eating

1052
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.239
the same food every day
or do you think that smaller studios are

1053
01:10:34.239 --> 01:10:38.320
going to pick up the slack and
you know like

1054
01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.760
studios like a24 which if anyone from
a24 is listening i would love to make a

1055
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.880
movie with you
um

1056
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.960
what do what do you guys think of the
current situation of hollywood and do

1057
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.520
you think that we're going to have a
resurrection of the roaring twenties

1058
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.760
let's hope so
okey-dokey oh my god i can't wait to
