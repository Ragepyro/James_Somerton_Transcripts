This video is brought to you by ATLAS VPN.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.340
Over the last several years there have been 
demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood  

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.100
movies. But something that many people don’t 
know is that the first movie to ever win Best  

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.520
Picture at the Academy Awards, was also the 
first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
William A. Wellman’s film Wings. Released in 1927.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.740
In "Wings," two World War I aviators compete 
for the affections of the same woman while  

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.060
coming to terms with their growing feelings for 
one another. Despite being labeled a "friendship"  

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.660
for the duration of the film (perhaps 
to circumvent censorship requirements),  

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.140
it is evident that these two men 
are developing romantic feelings  

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.680
for one another. Made clear by 
the climactic dramatic kiss.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
Wellman's silent film captures one of 
the earliest examples of LGBTQ cinema  

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.180
by carefully toeing the censorship line; the 
film examines the expressed passions of two  

13
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.640
men entangled in the conflict of WWI and the 
emotional torment of a forbidden connection.

14
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.220
Wings went on to be a box office smash, and 
even at a time when the film industry was  

15
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.800
quickly transitioning to sound, became the 
only truly silent film to win Best Picture.

16
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.180
But WINGS is actually not where our story begins.

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
The history of Hollywood has always 
had an asterisk beside it. Hidden in  

18
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.000
the footnotes in tiny little print, are 
the queer actors, filmmakers, executives,  

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.700
and tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from 
a backwater orange grove in California to the city  

20
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.180
in which thousands of young dreamers make their 
way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a  

21
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.540
long story. And like most classic American tales… 
it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

22
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.720
But before we get too deep into this history,

35
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.720
The love that dared not speak its name 
in America was surprisingly fluent when  

36
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.860
speaking German throughout the silent era 
of film. While America was using its new  

37
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.360
toy to glorify the Old West, recreating 
the fading dreams of its own mythology,  

38
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.760
European cinema was shaping a more realistic 
look at the diversity of sex and gender.

39
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.820
In much of Europe at the time, homosexuality was  

40
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.540
often just another aspect of the 
panorama of human relationships.

41
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.380
The Institute for Sexual Science, 
founded by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld,  

42
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.300
became ground zero in the fight against 
Germany's anti-gay paragraph 175,  

43
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.460
which criminalized homosexual actions between 
men, during the era of sexual enlightenment  

44
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.800
that occurred in pre-war Berlin. It also produced 
the first film to discuss homosexuality openly,  

45
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.760
and to contain many of the fundamental 
issues of the gay liberation movement.

46
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.760
Directed by Richard Oswald, ‘Different from 
the Others,’ released in 1919 openly pleaded  

47
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.280
tolerance, for what is termed the third sex. 
The program given out at screenings even read:

48
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.760
“False beliefs and unjustified 
prejudices concerning a sector  

49
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.380
of male and female sexual behavior known 
as homosexuality, or love of the same sex,  

50
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.180
have been predominant up to the present and 
still influence a large part of our population.

51
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.260
These homosexual men and women who are 
attracted to persons of their own sex,  

52
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.660
are often regarded as wicked criminals and 
libertines. But scientific research has determined  

53
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.760
that homosexuality is an inborn tendency for 
which the individual cannot be held responsible…

54
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.440
There are homosexuals in every class, among 
the educated and among the uneducated,  

55
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.580
and in the highest and lowest sectors 
of the population, in the great cities  

56
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.660
and the small towns, among the strict 
moralists and among the most easygoing;  

57
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.240
that love for one's own sex can be just as 
pure and noble as love for the opposite sex,  

58
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.760
the only difference being the object of 
desire, not the nature of one's love.”

59
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.100
The film, along with other works from the same era 
that dealt with topics such as abortion, incest,  

60
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.600
sex education, and venereal disease, 
was propagandistic in its approach.

61
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.460
In the early 1930s, Nazis were responsible for 
the destruction of most prints of the film.  

62
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.360
Christopher Isherwood recalls that at the 
time, Nazis frequently disrupted screenings  

63
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.860
of the film. In Vienna, one of them discharged a 
handgun into the crowd, injuring multiple people.  

64
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.960
In his book “Christopher and his kind,” Isherwood 
provides a first-person description of the movie:

65
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.560
“Three scenes remain in my memory. One is that 
a ball at which the dancers — all male — are  

66
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.900
standing, fully clothed in what seems about 
to become a daisy chain. It is here that  

67
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
the character played by Conrad Veidt meets the 
blackmailer who seduces him, and then ruins him.

68
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.560
The next scene is a vision in which 
Veidt has a long procession of kings,  

69
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.720
poets, scientists, philosophers, and other 
famous victims of homophobia, moving slowly,  

70
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.020
and sadly with hands bowed. Dr. Hirshfield himself 
appears. I think the corpse of (Conrad) Veidt,  

71
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.860
who has committed suicide at this 
point is laying in the background.

72
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.480
Hirshfield delivers a speech 
that is to say a series of  

73
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.940
titles pleading tolerance for the third sex.”

74
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.340
And so it was that the very first gay man 
to ever be portrayed on film met his tragic  

75
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.140
end by taking his own life. This would 
determine the future of LGBT characters  

76
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.900
on film and television for many years to 
come. The suicide of Veidt and the idea of  

77
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.680
blackmail predicted the fates of American 
screen characters who would suffer for  

78
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.260
their sexuality in like manner when American 
cinema reached a similar point of inclusion  

79
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.940
about 50 years later.
 
It would appear that the recognition  

80
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.920
of the "third sex" in Europe was not associated 
with a particular concept of masculinity,  

81
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.480
as was the case in the United States. 
The focus of the drama and intrigue was  

82
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.540
not on the sexual aspects of the passions that 
were awakened in human relationships; rather,  

83
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.160
the emotional qualities of the passions 
that were aroused in human relationships.

84
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.260
In ‘Mikhail,’ produced in 1924, we see a 
gay love story in which a famous artist  

85
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:52.740
falls in love with his young male model. The 
model, however, is an opportunist who saps his  

86
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.040
benefactor’s artistic spirit, eventually spurning 
his affections for the more promising charms of a  

87
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.260
wealthy young princess. In the end, the artist 
leaves all of his possessions to the youth,  

88
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.440
and on his deathbed declares: "I can 
die in peace. I have known a great love”

89
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.680
The film, which was adapted from the book of the 
same name, was released in America for a limited  

90
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:23.340
time in 1926 under murky circumstances. 
What would come to be titled: ‘Chained:  

91
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.900
The Story of The Third Sex’ ran for a 
short time at New York's Fifth Avenue  

92
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.880
Playhouse. American censors objected to its 
first issued English title: ‘The Inverts.’

93
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.000
The modifications to the titles 
provide an excellent illustration  

94
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.480
to the American thinking about 
homosexuality at that time.

95
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.640
The subtitle “the story of the third sex" suggests 
that any narrative that deals with gay love,  

96
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.280
regardless of how seriously it does so, is 
considered to be a story about homosexuality,  

97
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.020
while stories that deal with heterosexual 
love are simply seen as stories.  

98
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.000
This appears to be just as much of an issue 
for American filmmakers and producers today,  

99
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.480
as they appear to be unable to conceive of the 
existence of queer characters in a movie, unless  

100
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.280
the subject matter of the movie is being queer, as 
understood and depicted by mostly straight people.

101
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.800
This discussion of gay men shouldn’t suggest 
that lesbians didn’t also get attention. In  

102
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.680
the film ‘Pandora's Box,’ which was originally 
shown in Germany in 1929, there is a figure who  

103
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.860
is most likely the first lesbian on screen to be 
portrayed overtly. The film presented the story  

104
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.800
of the great unrequited love and passion between 
two women, the countess Geschwitz and the lady  

105
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.080
she is enamored with, Lulu. Although the love 
that Geschwitz feels for Lulu is referred to as  

106
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:49.020
‘sterile’ within the context of the movie, it is 
a driving force in the action, and it makes the  

107
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.480
introduction of a sapphic passion onscreen 
an exciting and historical cinematic event.

108
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.760
An event American audiences likely would 
never know of. British censors deleted the  

109
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.560
character of Countess Geschwitz from the film 
before prints were sent to America. Though  

110
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.060
original German prints did eventually 
make it across the pond in the 1960s.

111
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.540
When it comes to American-made gay characters, one 
of the earliest direct references to homosexuality  

112
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:21.480
was a parody. Which is… predictable, I suppose. 
The one-reel comedy short ‘The Soilers’,  

113
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.640
starring Stan Laurel, was a parody of 
the successful western ‘The Spoilers’.  

114
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:33.060
A drawn-out battle sequence between the film's 
lead, Laurel, and a corrupt sheriff takes up the  

115
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.680
majority of the running time. But another, 
very gay, cowboy suddenly appears on the  

116
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.720
scene in the middle of the brawl. As the two 
men continue to quarrel, he makes a show of  

117
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.560
batting his eyes at both of them and primping 
a little bit before sashaying out of the room.

118
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.860
Laurel wins the fight against the sheriff, 
but no one appears to care. As a result,  

119
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.900
he is left sitting outside the tavern, looking 
disheartened. The gay cowboy pokes his head  

120
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.700
out of a second-floor window and lavishly blows 
Laurel a kiss while mouthing the words ‘my hero.’  

121
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.080
When Laurel rejects him, he 
drops a flower pot on his head.

122
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.180
This is one of the first examples of the 
use of the ‘harmless sissy’ image to present  

123
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.220
homosexuality in film. But in the context 
of rough-and-tough men in the soon-to-be  

124
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.920
industry-dominant western genre, we were laying 
the foundations of the trope from the word ‘GO.’

125
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.480
There is a very overt connection between 
the effeminate and apparent homosexual  

126
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.260
in this film. Even though the cowboy was 
not supposed to be impersonating a woman,  

127
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.060
the primping and fussing characteristics that 
he displayed were unmistakably those of a woman.  

128
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.880
At least as men at the time expected women to act. 
The comedy here was highlighting how out-of-place  

129
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.540
this sissy boy was in this rough-and-tumble 
world of the men who won the west.

130
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:51.900
The irony of course is that… there is significant 
historical evidence to suggest that the west was  

131
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:58.800
in fact RIFE with gay men (many from Europe) and 
was largely settled by women in sex work. However  

132
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.200
even though The Soilers is a mockery of queerness, 
among other things, the use of satire indicates  

133
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.360
that Homosexuality, especially in the context of 
it existing in traditionally masculine spaces,  

134
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:15.300
was on the mind of the public at large. Satire 
can’t function well if it’s not deriving content  

135
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.120
from popular ideas. Even as the sissy cowboy 
isn’t flattering, though he is slaying, his  

136
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.580
inclusion indicates that the public was, perhaps 
at the time, willing to accept us as harmless,  

137
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.100
though strange and out of place.

138
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.900
However, this was precisely the kind of event that 
the censors were keeping an eye out for. Public  

139
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.760
Ordinances already enabled censoring organizations 
around the country to look at pictures in advance  

140
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.620
of their public showing. Although all of those 
such entities had little actual authority,  

141
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.480
their rules for morality in the movies clearly 
mentioned ‘sex perversion’ as a key don’t.  

142
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.040
Even if queerness was the subject of ridicule.

143
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.000
The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1915:

144
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.120
“The exhibition of motion pictures is a business, 
pure and simple and is conducted for-profit,  

145
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.320
like other spectacles not to be regarded 
or intended to be regarded as a part of  

146
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.100
the presence of the nation or 
the organs of public opinion."

147
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.440
This decision meant that movies were not protected 
by the first amendment guarantee of free speech.  

148
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.660
Due to this ruling, harsh censorship legislation 
was eventually enacted in the states of New York,  

149
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:27.240
Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia 
within a few years following this judgment.  

150
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.880
The gold standard in the United States was in 
the New York statute that was passed in 1921.

151
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.380
It stated that:

152
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.480
“A film should be licensed by the state, 
unless such a film or a part thereof is of  

153
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.100
such a character that its exhibition would 
tend to corrupt morals or incite crime.”

154
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.820
Indecency, immorality, and obscenity were 
nowhere described or defined in the statute,  

155
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.080
and thus there was considerable 
latitude for interpretations.  

156
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.680
Essentially giving free reign 
to wealthy, white, right-wing,  

157
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.440
Christian men to dictate what could and could not 
be in any given film released in these states.

158
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.640
One of the first instances of lesbians 
kissing on screen was in a brief orgy  

159
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.200
scene in Cecil B DeMille's ‘Manslaughter’ 
in 1922. The vision of two passionate women  

160
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.880
locked in a forbidden embrace, was used 
by DeMille to condemn the excesses of  

161
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.020
sex that he was portraying so 
graphically, and excessively.

162
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.940
In return for his judgment of the 
‘crime’ he was consistently allowed  

163
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.600
to paint a more explicit picture 
of evil, especially sexual sins,  

164
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.360
then was ordinarily permitted by Hollywood 
censors. Showing things like sex, homosexuality,  

165
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.360
interracial relationships, and other such things 
was fine, as long the participants were punished.  

166
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.440
This was particularly true when the 
retribution transpired in a biblical city.

167
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.460
Quoting Scripture on their title cards, 
DeMille films became moral lessons,  

168
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.340
rather than exploitation. Or so was said. 
They also became box office extravaganzas.  

169
00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:02.460
Which… leads me to wonder just how far back the 
connection between these distinctly American sets  

170
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.940
of pop-Christianity neo-puritanical values 
and American entertainment really goes.

171
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:14.160
By 1922 there were censorship bills 
before the legislatures of 32 states,  

172
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.900
and throughout the nation the distinct rank 
of moral indignation was wafting its way  

173
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:24.000
toward an industry that at times seemed 
to embody wicked behavior of all sorts.

174
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.080
The censors were horrified by ‘Salome,’ a 
1923 film with a reportedly all queer cast  

175
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.940
made in tribute to Oscar Wilde. Forcing 
several sequences to be cut all together,  

176
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.360
including one showing the gay 
relationship between two Syrian  

177
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.580
soldiers. The handwritten report of the 
examining censor in New York concluded:

178
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:50.940
"This picture is in no way religious in theme or 
interpretation. In my judgment, it is a story of  

179
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:58.080
depravity and immorality made worse because of 
its biblical background. Absolutely sacrilegious.”

180
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.720
American censors became even more potent in 
the late 1920s and early 30s. The inclusion of  

181
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.940
audio into what were briefly dubbed as ‘talkies’ 
brought a new element of realism to the screen,  

182
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:15.060
and public morality watch dogs began to bear 
down on the industry. But while censorship laws  

183
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:21.720
were becoming more specific, their outlook on gay 
representation was kept vaguely broad. You didn’t  

184
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.840
need two men or women kissing to get banned. Cross 
dressing, weakness or softness in male characters,  

185
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.880
and even overly intellectual male characters 
were enough to draw the ire of censors.

186
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.520
Will Hayes was appointed president of the Motion 
Picture Producers and Distributors of America — or  

187
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:45.000
MPPDA — in the late 1920s. Hayes served as both 
an elder in the Presbyterian church and as a  

188
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.860
former Postmaster General of the United States. 
That was the extent of his qualifications. The  

189
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.060
organization was established primarily with the 
goals of fostering positive public relations for  

190
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.380
the studios and shielding the business from 
the potential for more restrictions from the  

191
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.360
outside world, which they mostly achieved in 
1930 when the motion picture production code,  

192
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.800
which served as the basis for the industry's 
self-regulation and censorship, was actually  

193
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.240
written. When the code was strengthened 
in 1934 under intense pressure from the  

194
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.500
Catholic Church, even gently alluded 
gay characters began to disappear.

195
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.180
The image of the film business as being harsh 
and manly, with no tolerance for foolishness,  

196
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.200
was in continual conflict with the 
industry's reputation for being  

197
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.340
effeminate. The censors used the ‘sissy’ 
archetype to target on-screen characters,  

198
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.260
using it as a thinly-veiled scapegoat to 
put pressure on a relatively progressive  

199
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.180
media industry which had been a safe haven 
for queer creators of all types up to then.

200
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.160
But filmmakers knew how to skirt the 
censors in many cases. The fact that  

201
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.220
most early movie ‘sissies’ were only gay if 
one chose to see them as being gay was simply  

202
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.680
a reflection of the fact that the existence 
of queer people in society was acknowledged  

203
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.320
only when society chose to do so. Instead 
of being overtly queer — characters like,  

204
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.720
say, the femme cowboy from The Soilers, were 
viewed as symbols for ‘failed’ masculinity,  

205
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.100
rather than actual homosexuals. And 
so they were allowed to stick around.

206
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.820
Most ‘sissies’ during the reign of the 
code were not necessarily demeaned,  

207
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.840
nor were they used in cruel or 
offensive ways. It was not the sissy,  

208
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.480
but what he stood for that was offensive. Some 
actors created memorable galleries of gossipy  

209
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.120
snoops and snippy shopkeepers, who were often 
a little on the innocent side. But not always.

210
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.540
Gays were also associated with dangerous  

211
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.020
revolutionaries hiding beneath 
the surface of normal society.

212
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.940
The ghetto was one otherworld in which gay 
characters might frequently be seen on-screen  

213
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.260
before and after the reign of the Motion Picture 
Production Code. This represented the reality of  

214
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.360
the majority of Gay experiences at the time, 
which had been restricted to manifestations in  

215
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.640
slums of one kind or another. The underground 
life as a shelter for gays is a common theme.

216
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.800
In many instances, the gay ghetto has been 
linked to the criminal underground. This is due  

217
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:08.640
to the fact that whenever there is an increase in 
illegal activity of any kind, even homosexuality,  

218
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.440
organized crime moves in to take control of 
the situation and make a profit. (Though it  

219
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.520
should be noted that organized crime functions 
VERY differently than Hollywood often depicts,  

220
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.160
and in some cases, especially from the 40s and 
onward, can be beneficial to growing a community  

221
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.320
and preventing gentrification and climbing rental 
rates.) Though as far as Hollywood played into  

222
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.600
misconceptions of criminal behavior, homosexuals 
were widely considered to be a criminal group,  

223
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.240
which differentiated them from other types of 
minority groups. Crime rates might be high in  

224
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.560
some majority non-white areas, but just 
being a person of color was not, itself,  

225
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.540
technically illegal. (Though representatives 
and law enforcement may act otherwise.)

226
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.400
The film ‘Blood Money,’ released in 1933, 
showed a great deal of ambiguous sexual  

227
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.680
tension in a wider underworld. In the movie, the 
existence of homosexuality is openly acknowledged  

228
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.600
in the subculture that is a shelter on the 
fringes of acceptable society. In the film,  

229
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.180
Sandra Shaw is featured in several sequences 
as a fun-loving blonde who likes men's clothes.

230
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.680
At one point in the film, her boyfriend is 
preparing for a date along with his sister,  

231
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.680
a nightclub owner, who warns 
him about the kind of women  

232
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.120
he's running with, but he waves her fears aside.

233
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.635
“Oh this one is nothing but class. 
Wears a monocle and a man’s tuxedo.”

234
00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:21.660
“Then you’re safe.”

235
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.320
Though he gets what she means, and protests,  

236
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.900
later in the film Shaw turns up again in a tweed 
jacket, this time with another woman in tow.

237
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.420
Movies like this were what led to further 
intensification of censorship in the mid 1930s.  

238
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.820
In addition to strengthening the Code, Will Hays 
reacted to criticism by inserting morality clauses  

239
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:48.660
into the contracts of actors, and compiled a 
"doom book" of 117 names of those deemed "unsafe"  

240
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.720
because of their personal lives. Homosexuality 
was denied as fervently offscreen as it was on,  

241
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.960
a literally unspeakable part of the culture.

242
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.940
Hollywood has always been more restrained 
on the screen than in real life. In “blood  

243
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.320
money” homosexuality is just another pocket 
of an underworld that exists outside the law.

244
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.660
Sexual connotations often surrounded the 
attitude of powerful men toward hired boys,  

245
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:18.120
or servile companions. Although the villainous 
character of Joel Cairo in “The Maltese Falcon,”  

246
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:24.180
is identified by Sam Spade's secretary in the 
novel as homosexual, the film version, instead,  

247
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.860
just turns him into a perfume wearing, 
cane kissing, ‘sissy’ with lace hankies.

248
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.200
Elisha Cook jr. as Sidney Greenstreet's 
bodyguard Wilmer, however, is implicitly  

249
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.380
homosexual. He is referred to as "sonny," 
"boy" and "kid," and Bogart derisively calls  

250
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.420
him a "gunsel." Since about 1915, prisoners had 
used the German word gunsel to mean a bottom,  

251
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.300
especially young inexperienced criminal bottoms.

252
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.260
All of this was meant to connect the queer 
underworld with the underworld run, mostly,  

253
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.520
by the Sicillian mafia who, due to 
movies like Scarface and Public Enemy,  

254
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.760
were roundly feared across the country.

255
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.220
This “fear the queer” mindset was brought 
to its logical conclusion in the horror  

256
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.960
films of the 1930s, where gays appeared 
as predatory, twilight creatures with a  

257
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.700
sense of style. The equation of horror 
with the sins of the flesh is easily  

258
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.600
seen in monster movies of the period. 
Creatures like Frankenstein’s monster  

259
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.360
and Count Dracula were almost always linked 
with the baser instincts of human beings.

260
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.700
The essence of homosexuality as a predatory 
weakness permeates the depiction of gay characters  

261
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.160
in horror films. In Dracula's Daughter, Countess 
Maria Zalesca has a special attraction to women,  

262
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.020
a preference that was even highlighted 
in some of the original ads for the film.

263
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.780
Queer parallels in 1931’s ‘Frankenstein’ and 
its 1935 sequel, ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’  

264
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.500
arose from a vision both films had 
of the monster as an impossible,  

265
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.120
antisocial figure in the same way that gay people 
were "things" that should not have happened.

266
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.520
In both films, the homosexuality of director 
James Whale may have been the spark of the vision.  

267
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.500
Robert Aldrich, director of camp progenitor: 
‘Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,’ recalls that:

268
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.240
”Jimmy Whale was the first guy who was 
blackballed because he refused to stay in  

269
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.560
the closet. Mitchell Leisen and all those other 
guys played it straight, and they were onboard,  

270
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.180
but Whale said, “**** it, I'm a great director 
and I don't have to put up with this bull****

271
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.540
And he was a great director, not 
just a company director. And he  

272
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.060
was just unemployed after 
that. Never worked again.”

273
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:30.900
It should be noted that many articles on James 
Whale do not reference his refusal to be closeted,  

274
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.720
nor the Hayes Code in general, as a reason 
for the decline of his career. In spite of  

275
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.720
available first-hand testimonials demonstrating 
that it wasn’t just a contributing factor — that  

276
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.180
it was THE main reason. And Aldrich, who WAS a 
company director, if not an incredibly good one,  

277
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.520
would have been in-the-know about what producers 
and studio heads were saying behind the scenes.

278
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.920
According to Aldrich, an obviously lesbian 
director like Dorthy Arzner got away with her  

279
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.080
lifestyle because she was officially closeted. 
A gay woman keeping her ‘lifestyle’ on the sly  

280
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.460
was fine because “it made her one of 
the boys.” But a man who, like Whale,  

281
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.080
openly admitted to his loving relationship with 
another man, in this case producer David Lewis,  

282
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.300
did not stand a chance. Although James 
Whale worked again briefly in 1943,  

283
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.380
he fell into obscurity soon after. In 1957 he was 
found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool.

284
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.360
Frankenstein’s monster was the creation 
that would eventually destroy its creator  

285
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.820
just as Whale’s own ‘aberration’ would 
eventually destroy his career. The monster  

286
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.860
in ‘Frankenstein’ bears the brunt of society's 
reaction to his existence, and in the sequel,  

287
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:47.280
the bride of Frankenstein, the monster himself 
is painfully aware of his own unnaturalness.

288
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.200
In ‘Frankenstein,’ it is the monster who 
limits Henry Frankenstein's contact with  

289
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.260
the normal world. The old Baron, Frankenstein's 
father, continually begs his son to "leave this  

290
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.280
madness," to come home, and marry the 
young Elizabeth. Finally the father,  

291
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.400
Elizabeth and Henry's best friend go to the lab 
and force him, for his own good, to leave his  

292
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.700
creation behind… to be free from his "obsession". 
To be normal. Later the monster fulfills Mary  

293
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.060
Shelley's initial prophecy by joining his creator 
on his wedding night, carrying off Elizabeth, and  

294
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.180
thereby preventing the consummation 
of the heterosexual marriage.

295
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.760
The monster is then hunted by the townspeople.

296
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.640
In ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’ it is the odd, 
sissified Dr. Praetorius who comes to entice Henry  

297
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.900
Frankenstein from his bridal bed in the middle 
of the night. Praetorius too has created life,  

298
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.780
and Henry's curiosity again overcomes his 
"good" instincts and proves his downfall.  

299
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.700
Praetorius proclaims himself to be in love 
with evil and professes to detest goodness.  

300
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.200
No accident, then, that the monster, seeing the 
unnaturalness and folly of his own existence,  

301
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.180
takes the evil Praetorius with him when he pulls 
the lever to destroy himself and his bride,  

302
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.080
crying out to the young heterosexual 
couple of Henry and Elizabeth:

303
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:06.960
“Go! You live. Go. You stay.  

304
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.880
We belong dead.”

305
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.240
In later decades, the queerness 
of the Frankenstein story would  

306
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.040
reach its logical camp conclusion with ‘The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show.’ A cult-classic  

307
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.300
rock-musical that Twentieth Century-Fox 
never gave a proper wide release in the  

308
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.560
United States. And it’s unlikely that, 
now that they own it, Disney will either.

309
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.880
Since 1976, the film has been playing 
midnight shows in cities throughout  

310
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.380
the country. A truly subversive film 
on the subjects of sexuality, movies,  

311
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:39.120
sex roles, and the queer as monster, 
Rocky Horror features two innocent,  

312
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.160
presumed straight protagonists (Brad and Janet) 
who have car troubles not far from a dubious  

313
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.580
mansion. This foreboding manor is the residence of 
one Dr. Frank N Furter, the apotheosis of deviant  

314
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.560
sexuality, who introduces himself as “a Sweet 
Transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania."

315
00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.540
Frank N Furter is an androgynous alien from outer 
space. When the timid straight couple arrive,  

316
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.280
he is in the process of showing off his 
latest creation, a hunky blond named Rocky,  

317
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.440
who is straight off the slab and wears nothing 
but tight gold trunks. Pointing to Rocky,  

318
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.320
Frank N Furter sings a lusty "In Just Seven Days,  

319
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.320
I Can Make You a Man," then proceeds to 
introduce Brad and Janet to, well, his penis.

320
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.200
Possible penis. We can’t know for 
certain. He is an alien, after all.

321
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.220
As both a catalog, and a spoof of old 
monster movies and science fiction films,  

322
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.960
‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ becomes almost 
dizzying in its references, but its most  

323
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.900
expert satire is of the age-old fear with which 
mainstream society encounters deviant sexuality.

324
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.280
And is then followed through to the very end, 
when Frank N Furter is destroyed “for the  

325
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.320
good of society.” Nevertheless he has one last 
chance in life to perform with the entire cast,  

326
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.320
an underwater ballet version of the film’s 
main message “Don’t dream it. Be it.”  

327
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.480
A song that becomes a message of hope 
for everyone who feels like they’re  

328
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.340
not quite who they’re supposed to be just yet.

329
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.360
Tim Curry's performance, especially in 
his rendition of "Sweet Transvestite,"  

330
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.380
is the essence of what every parent in America 
feared would happen if our sexual standards were  

331
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:16.740
relaxed. It becomes the living horror of making 
deviant sexuality visible and tangible in the only  

332
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:22.920
kind of setting in which it could possibly work, 
an old dark house populated by every letter of  

333
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:28.260
the LGBTQ alphabet soup, as they sing rock and 
roll to seduce the innocent youth of America.

334
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.180
Hollywood didn't know what to do with 
the Rocky horror picture show then and  

335
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.560
probably wouldn't know what to do with it 
now. But despite its shabby treatment it  

336
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.460
has grossed hundreds of millions of 
dollars over the years and continues  

337
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.780
to play throughout the world to audiences 
made up of largely young people who attend  

338
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.460
screenings with bags of rice, stale 
toast, corsets, boas, and fishnets.

339
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.680
Rocky Horror was shining a spotlight on the 
dimly lit representation of queer monsters  

340
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.900
in the 1930s golden age of Hollywood. Giving 
them one last hurrah as a posthumous victory  

341
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.700
against the Hayes code, which collapsed 
entirely just a few years before its release.

342
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:12.060
But back in the 1930s, filmmakers still had 
to be clever about coding the characters,  

343
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.760
specifically to make it past the censors.  

344
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.500
General American audiences though 
could easily see through the coding.

345
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.900
However, it wasn’t long 
before the easily read coding  

346
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.560
was forced to become almost, 
if not completely illegible.

347
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.240
Thank you for watching this video, which is 
actually the first of eight videos I’ll be  

348
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.620
releasing over the next few months exploring the 
history of queer representation in Hollywood.  

349
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.620
If you’d like to see more historical videos like 
this, as well as my usual video essays, podcasts,  

350
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:51.360
behind the scenes videos, and a whole lot more, 
please consider joining my Patreon, linked in  

351
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.220
the description. YouTube does have a habit of 
hiding queer content, especially educational  

352
00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:02.760
queer content, so it’s only because of my patrons 
that I can do videos like this. And for as little  

353
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.460
as a dollar a month you can join this surprisingly 
awesome community that keeps this channel going.

354
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.840
Now that I’ve awkwardly promoted my Patreon,  

355
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.320
I’ll let the credits roll and I’ll see you soon 
for Unrequited Episode 2: The Invisible Men.
