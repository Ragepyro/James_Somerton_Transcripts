00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.700
hello everyone and welcome to episode 21
of the padreon my name is James and this

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.679
week
um

3
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.299
I think this episode may be another
episode that goes out live

4
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.380
on to
um my YouTube channel because this is

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.660
something that I feel like needs to be
talked about

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
instead of just my inane ramblings
laughs

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.100
so we're gonna have a chat about uh kit
Connor who most of you would know as

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.879
Nick from heartstopper and how he has
been forced to

9
00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.360
out himself because of a lot of people
saying that he is queerbaiting by

10
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.199
playing a bisexual character on a
television show heartstopper on Netflix

11
00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
um
but not coming out as some flavor of

12
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.899
queer
and so they've been saying they've and

13
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
they've been saying this for months now
he left Twitter for a while

14
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.799
because people were
just attacking him over this kind of

15
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.880
demanding that he come out
and so he left Twitter for a while and

16
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.000
um yesterday October 31st he put out a
tweet saying back for a minute I'm bi

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.799
congrats for forcing an 18 year old to
out himself I think some of you missed

18
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.920
the point of the show bye
which is basically sums up my opinion of

19
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.000
the whole situation that
an internet mob demanding

20
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.340
a queer person to out themselves
um

21
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.399
forced someone an 18 year old who you
know I'm I'm 33 I look at an 18 year old

22
00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.979
as a kid like I know you know like 18 is
the age of adult blah blah all that I

23
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.759
don't care an 18 year old is a kid
um

24
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.080
you know they're still figuring stuff
out I know people who didn't figure out

25
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.180
their kind of queer status until they
were in their 20s or 30s some even in

26
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.720
their 40s or later
and

27
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.239
so
I did a stream last night and that's

28
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.739
when I was informed of this live
um

29
00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.700
so I was kind I was doing a stream
playing a video game playing Resident

30
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.379
Evil and so I was kind of trying to have
to figure out okay how do I do this how

31
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.400
do I how how do I play the video game
and like

32
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.739
sum up my thoughts on this and so that's
why I decided to do this podcast and for

33
00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.060
my pray turns for my patrons I do
apologize for putting this one live I

34
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.739
know the patreon or the patreon is
supposed to be Patron exclusive

35
00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.260
um but I do think that this is a topic
that

36
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
ought to be discussed uh like I said
[Music]

37
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.560
um
and even I'm just kind of

38
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.540
looking around
at different articles talking about it

39
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.519
variety for instance says heartstopper
Creator and fans rally around star kit

40
00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.959
Connor after he's
forced to come out as bisexual and they

41
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.540
have forced in quotation marks
as if he is

42
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.840
you know kind of
drumming up drama around this that oh he

43
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.239
wasn't forced to come out it's like no
there has been so much

44
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.819
pressure from a certain section of the
internet a very loud section of the

45
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.459
internet for Kit Connor to come out as
queer in some way

46
00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.819
that I can imagine for an 18 year old
who is just getting his start in the

47
00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.420
Indus in the film industry who's just
getting his start really as an actor

48
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.220
he's been an actor before like he was in
rocket man he played young Elton John

49
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.299
um and he obviously he's done other
projects as well but you know Heart

50
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.739
Stopper is his first you know big hit
it's made him famous and just as he's

51
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.960
hitting this stride at such a young age
of 18

52
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:34.100
there Comes This wave of negativity
basically saying you are illegitimate

53
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.860
your character is illegitimate you are
not worth the time of the queer

54
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.259
Community if you don't come out and so I
just want to talk about first of all I

55
00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.280
want to talk about coming out in the
film industry

56
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.100
um
because that's kind of I know a lot of

57
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.000
people in the film industry I know a lot
of gay people in the film industry and I

58
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.259
know a lot of uh people in the film
industry who know a lot of gay people in

59
00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:07.380
the film industry who are not out a lot
of actors who are not out of the closet

60
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.040
um publicly they are to friends and
family their agents you know their

61
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.720
managers know producers know but an
industry exists to make sure that the

62
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.000
vast majority of people do not know
because they are

63
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.039
the type of actors who could be
classified as Leading Men

64
00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.460
um
you know like the Leonardo DiCaprio's of

65
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.080
the world not not Leonardo DiCaprio
isn't one of them but you know people

66
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.880
who could be on his level
there are actors who could be on his

67
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.560
level and there is who are gay
um who basically everyone in the

68
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.699
industry knows they just keep quiet
about it because they know there would

69
00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.320
be a huge backlash and their career may
very well be torpedoed as it's just kind

70
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.039
of getting off to a good start
if they were to be outed

71
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:10.080
because that is unfortunately still how
Hollywood works now I know we know lots

72
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.280
and lots of gay actors
um

73
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.199
let me just
bring up uh a list of them here just so

74
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:25.699
that I'm not uh hemming and highing like
I already am

75
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.479
but you know you've got actors like
Zachary Quinto and Neil Patrick Harris

76
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:40.259
and Jim Parsons and Jane Lynch and Raven
Simone and Guillermo Diaz and Ian

77
00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.180
McKellen of course and Sarah Paulson and
Matt Bomer and Cynthia Nixon and Kristen

78
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.160
Stewart and uh well obviously Elton John
Sarah Gilbert

79
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.539
um Cheyenne Jackson Colton Haynes who
recently released an autobiography

80
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.259
talking about his coming out process
um

81
00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:06.479
uh Ben winshaw uh Wanda Sykes Wentworth
Miller Rosie O'Donnell Ricky Martin Lily

82
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:13.020
Tomlin Sam Smith Jesse Tyler Ferguson so
you know we know lots of queer actors

83
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.720
and performers and celebrities we know
lots of queer celebrities and so I think

84
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.720
we have gotten used to the idea of oh
well it's all better in Hollywood now

85
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.340
that you know maybe 20 years ago if you
came out your career would be torpedoed

86
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.319
but not now not now it's everything's
everything's better now because you know

87
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.560
Hollywood is so gay
um

88
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.580
and
you know there are the the sort of

89
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.280
behind the scenes of Hollywood the
um the people who really make the town

90
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.740
run
are

91
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.139
I don't want to say majority but a
pretty sizable chunk of them are a part

92
00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.900
of the queer Community
um

93
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.699
but the people who make the decisions
the people who make the final decisions

94
00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:08.819
I'm talking The Producers the executives
they are not gay for the most part some

95
00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:13.639
of them are like Ryan Murphy but for the
most and he goes out of his way like

96
00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:20.699
he's said some dumb stuff in the last
week regarding the Dahmer series but he

97
00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:30.060
has gone far out of his way to give
queer performers all across the Spectrum

98
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.719
an opportunity to get
um

99
00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:38.099
viewed by a much larger Audience by
being on hit shows like American Horror

100
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:42.419
Story and American Crime Story and as
well as

101
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.740
giving them work in general
because

102
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.839
work for queer performers is kinda hard
to come by especially like the cast of

103
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.120
Poe's
um

104
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.080
having transgender actresses and
non-binary actresses and non-binary

105
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.980
actors uh getting them work on a highly
regarded show

106
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.680
is something that it does take a Ryan
Murphy type figure to do even though

107
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.720
Ryan Murphy didn't really run Poe's uh
pose was mostly run by actually uh

108
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.800
creators of color
um and trans creators of color as well

109
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.760
which is really great that you know
executive producers were hired that

110
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.740
actually were a part of the community
but other than Ryan Murphy

111
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.420
there aren't a lot of queer producers or
Executives out there to give queer

112
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.640
actors a chance to shine
it is mostly old white men

113
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:51.360
grumpy old white men like the
um the CEO of Disney the CEO of Warner

114
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.920
Brothers these kind of guys that you
look at them and you're like oh you can

115
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.720
just see just by looking at them like
you're like oh you hate us

116
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.720
um
and you know whether they hate us or not

117
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.459
they're certainly not going out of their
way to support us

118
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:15.720
and so that is really who runs the film
industry like from the top because the

119
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.120
people who make the film industry you
know work as you know a well-oiled

120
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.320
machine they are
um

121
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.540
they are gay people and lesbians and
trans people and non-binary people they

122
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:36.300
are the people who make Productions work
but the people who make Productions

123
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.019
funded
are the straight old white men

124
00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:44.959
and those straight old white men still
have a very

125
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:49.140
strict idea
of what

126
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:56.940
classifies
as marketable to a mainstream audience

127
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.160
and
they do not think to this day they do

128
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.899
not think that gay actors are marketable
to a mainstream audience

129
00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:14.760
there have been multiple actors just
over the last couple of years who you

130
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.899
can find with a relatively ego easy
Google search I'm not going to talk

131
00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:21.779
about their name I'm not going to
mention their names

132
00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.260
because that would be outing them I've
talked about it on streams and stuff

133
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.680
like that but I'm not going to talk
about it on a video that's you know up

134
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.920
forever
um but there are pretty major actors

135
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.279
um
who have been you know coming up in the

136
00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.899
industry in the last couple of years
who have almost had their careers

137
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:47.540
destroyed
because they came out on Instagram

138
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.220
or they had a couple of many Paparazzi
too many Paparazzi pictures taken of

139
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.240
them at the beach with their boyfriend
um

140
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:04.079
and people who came out over a decade
ago who quickly went back into the

141
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:09.899
closet and have been very deep within
the closet since then to the point where

142
00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:15.300
they're being set up with actresses and
things like that to kind of keep hush

143
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.440
um
so that nobody questions their sexuality

144
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.899
and this is how Hollywood still to this
day works this is what was happening in

145
00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:31.680
the 19 like 40s and 50s with Rock Hudson
where actors like Rod Rock Hudson and

146
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.160
actors like Anthony Perkins would be
given girlfriends

147
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.839
and by producers and Executives and said
okay now you're gonna go to dinner with

148
00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:42.540
her and you're going to be seen and
we're going to make sure that the Press

149
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.839
is there and that was done and it's
still done to this day that is still

150
00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:53.399
done because these old white men
producers

151
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:58.980
thoroughly believe that if an actor is
gay

152
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.700
the majority of America and again this
is Hollywood so this is very

153
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.519
america-centric
um

154
00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:11.700
that the majority of America would
basically disown them

155
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.480
and
whether they're right or not

156
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:22.019
we don't really know because we've never
had a really good case study

157
00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:27.800
of it in a general sense with Neil
Patrick Harris

158
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.700
he kind of went away for a very long
time and then came back and came out

159
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.920
but he was a part of a hit TV show that
was where he was playing a very straight

160
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.839
character and did a good job a good
really good job doing it and so it was

161
00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:49.139
easy for audiences to kind of
disassociate his uh homosexuality

162
00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:53.279
because he was so good at playing this
womanizing straight character

163
00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:56.519
and
since then

164
00:13:56.519 --> 00:14:02.760
he hasn't been in
any huge projects if you notice he was

165
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.260
in Gone Girl but in a very minor
supporting character uh he was in the

166
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.720
new series on Netflix uh the title of it
is escaping me but he it was

167
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.279
um a quote unquote quote unquote older
gay man so Neil Patrick Harris's age

168
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:20.760
which as far as I'm concerned that's not
an older gay man

169
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.720
um
but uh he and his long his long-term

170
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.100
partner dumps him and he's kind of
forced out into the dating game again

171
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.240
and it was not a success
and

172
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:40.560
the timing of this in particular
is incredibly bad

173
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.339
because
the question of okay are gay actors

174
00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:53.160
marketable
was put to a test with Bros

175
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.139
and
say what you will about Bros

176
00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:03.779
it was
two gay actors in the lead roles of this

177
00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:08.339
movie the quality of notwithstanding the
problems with

178
00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:10.800
um
uh

179
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.180
the main actor I can't believe I'm
forgetting his name I'm I'm I just sat

180
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.399
down to do this right after a stream so
I'm kind of flighty I apologize

181
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:27.060
um but the
the main actor had some problems and

182
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.660
stuff but like forget about all that
Hollywood doesn't care about that

183
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.079
uh Hollywood doesn't give a damn about
the technicalities surrounding the

184
00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.959
failure of a movie Billy Eichner sorry I
had to Google it because it was driving

185
00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:43.920
me crazy uh Billy Eichner and Luke
McFarland were the lead characters lead

186
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.180
actors in that movie both of them are
out gay men and have been out and gay

187
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.139
for quite a while
um

188
00:15:51.139 --> 00:16:00.060
and the movie bombed
at like almost like drastic levels uh

189
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:06.540
with a 22 million dollar budget and a an
estimated marketing budget of 30 million

190
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.480
dollars
which there's been no confirmation

191
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.680
that's just kind of what's leaked out of
you know different Hollywood sources

192
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.579
that would mean that the movie would
need to make a hundred million dollars

193
00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:22.320
to break even because basically
uh I've talked about this in videos

194
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.519
before
basically for a movie to break even it

195
00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.699
has to make twice as much at the box
office

196
00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:40.320
as it cost to make and Market because
movie theaters keep roughly 50 of the

197
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.519
money that is made
so 50 million dollars and it's made 13

198
00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:48.660
million so
huge bomb huge bomb because it needed to

199
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.019
make about 100 million to break even
um

200
00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:59.100
so
that is the most recent gay thing

201
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:05.839
that Hollywood will look at
and they look at that and they say oh

202
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:13.079
nope gay actors are not marketable
and they don't look at this the the the

203
00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.760
sort of the surrounding Confluence of
events they did they don't Executives

204
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.280
don't care about that they don't care
about people's opinions on why something

205
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.319
failed they just look at it as black and
white failure success did it break even

206
00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:34.160
was a profit gained from this project no
it's a failure

207
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.360
there is no caveats there it's a failure
that's the way Executives work

208
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.200
Executives don't think about social
causes Executives think about dollar

209
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.820
signs that's what their job is that's
what they're paid to do

210
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.940
um
and so like I said again sorry for

211
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:57.360
repeating myself Bros is the most recent
thing in Hollywood's memory as far as

212
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.280
gay actors go
and

213
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:07.799
now or as queer actors go
and now with kit Harrington not kid

214
00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:11.220
Harrington oh my god
um kit Connor

215
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.780
kit Harrington is not gay uh with kick
on her

216
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.760
um being forced to come out as bisexual
and he was forced to come out as

217
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.400
bisexual because there was so much
pressure put on this kid

218
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.260
for him to come out
because

219
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:38.160
from from some fans of Heart Stopper who
said that

220
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.120
you know I'm gonna stop watching the
show if he's straight

221
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.679
other fans
um other people who may not even be fans

222
00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:52.260
saying that he's queerbaiting the
Audience by not coming out as bisexual

223
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.520
that he's pulling a hairy styles by not
saying it one way or another

224
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.280
and while seeing all of this I'm like
guys he's 18 years old give him a break

225
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.360
give him some time
um

226
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:12.240
it's you know just infuriating
and

227
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.820
and this is from someone who used to be
very like okay listen if you're gay and

228
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.240
you're in media you need to come out
because we need more

229
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:28.580
um
we we need more uh exposure

230
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:36.480
but he's 18. like this isn't like if
uh who's a who's an actor that's like

231
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.380
really bulletproof
um

232
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.000
Chris Evans it's not like if Chris Evans
came out and said I'm gay

233
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.940
a lot of people would be like oh but
plenty of people would still go to see

234
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.500
Chris Evans movies
I don't think it would hit Chris Evans

235
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.720
very hard if he came out as gay
because he has an established fan base

236
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.160
he has as an established career he has
established relationships you know he's

237
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.740
Captain America
um

238
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.299
or at least he was Captain America
um so it wouldn't really affect him that

239
00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:16.620
much
if someone like

240
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.299
uh well Leonardo DiCaprio if Leonardo
DiCaprio came out as bisexual it would

241
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:27.120
not affect him at all if anything it
might increase his fan base

242
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.720
um but you know kit Connor is just
getting started in his career

243
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:37.460
and with Bros just show having shown
Hollywood that

244
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:44.960
gay actors are box office poison
or queer actors or our box office poison

245
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.039
and you now have Kit Connor being forced
to come out

246
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:54.539
that puts a big asterisk above his
career

247
00:20:54.539 --> 00:21:00.120
because now there is a question hovering
over him

248
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.020
kid Connor has been in talks for big
roles

249
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.100
um
he didn't come to Hollywood for most for

250
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:14.280
a big chunk of 2022 to see the sights
he came to Hollywood to talk to Casting

251
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.919
agents and talk to Casting executives
because Heart Stopper came out it was

252
00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:26.760
huge there was an immediate
thirst for him among lots of teenage

253
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.440
girls and teenage boys and a lot of much
older people

254
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.340
um
a little problematic but anyway

255
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:40.320
that he gained a huge fan base and a
huge following on social media just

256
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:46.380
people sharing every single picture
taken of him anywhere whether it was a

257
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.520
Paparazzi picture it was a selfie it was
a picture taken with fans it would just

258
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.679
be shared everywhere kit Connor was
trended on Twitter so often

259
00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:59.820
it was like every single day I saw him
trending on Twitter

260
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.880
um

261
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:07.919
and so like he
had this golden opportunity handed to

262
00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.500
him because of what came out of Heart
Stopper

263
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.340
that

264
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.240
none of the other actors on the show
have really gotten the

265
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.900
and you ask yourself well why not are
they not as good

266
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.320
no
it's because the other especially the

267
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.640
other queer actors on the show
they're out they were out when the show

268
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.380
came out
and so for most Hollywood Executives and

269
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.559
casting agents they were immediately
written off

270
00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:43.500
they weren't flown into Hollywood to
read for roles at DC or Marvel or

271
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.679
Universal projects or things for
um you know I don't know the rings of

272
00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:52.919
power or something I don't know
um

273
00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:57.120
uh or House of the Dragon whatever they
weren't brought in to read for these

274
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:03.900
giant projects uh I don't know for sure
what kit Connor was brought in to read

275
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.559
for and by read for I mean audition
um

276
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:12.960
and to speak to Casting agents and get
to know people but he was brought in

277
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.159
and he had this amazing opportunity and
I think that's why he left Twitter

278
00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:24.900
because it was like you know I have this
amazing opportunity as a very young

279
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:30.120
actor
to be able to really

280
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:37.320
you know gain a foothold in this incr in
this industry that is near impossible to

281
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.260
gain a foothold in
and

282
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.260
people were you know poking and prodding
and saying you need to come out you need

283
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.220
to come out you need to come out and so
he left Twitter for a while because he's

284
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.780
like I I'm not going to do that I I
can't right now

285
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.380
and
I understand that

286
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:04.799
I completely understand that because
like I said there is still a huge stigma

287
00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:10.740
for queer actors in Hollywood
um and you know there are plenty of

288
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.200
queer actors getting roles on Netflix
and and shows in the UK and on TV in

289
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:24.720
general but not in movies
he was reading for big roles in movies

290
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.880
and
now that Heart Stopper is shooting

291
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.559
season two even though he hasn't been on
Twitter he is basically on Twitter

292
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:40.980
because people are sharing uh they've
been in Paris filming on on location and

293
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.179
so people have been sharing pictures and
then the comments under these pictures

294
00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:49.380
just become a deluge of he's
queerbaiting he's queerbaiting he's

295
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:56.100
queerbaiting he's queerbaiting
and so he comes back and says you know

296
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.480
back for a minute I'm bi congrats for
forcing an 18 year old out himself I

297
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.080
think some of you missed the point of
the show bye

298
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.679
and
because there's just so much pressure

299
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:12.059
because there's the potential
that

300
00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:16.440
a lot of people would say I don't like
him because I think he's queerbaiting

301
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.980
and he should come out so I'm not going
to watch season two

302
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.400
and then season two fails and then that
Torpedoes the careers of everyone else

303
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.020
on that show
then it's a one-hit season wonder One

304
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.140
season Wonder
and

305
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:40.500
then it's not just kick Connor's career
who's in danger it's everyone's career

306
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.059
if these
asshats

307
00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:49.500
decided to you know not watch the show
anymore because they were angry at kit

308
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.580
Connor for not coming out

309
00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:57.419
and so I think he was thinking of his
friends and his co-workers and his

310
00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:04.500
castmates and he was like I don't want
their careers to be torpedoed by this

311
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.120
toxic
group of people

312
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.260
so
I'm going to you know

313
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:19.200
take the arrow to the knee and
you know go on there and come out and

314
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.919
you can tell just by the Tweet he's not
happy about this because this isn't

315
00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:27.179
someone who has come to terms with their
sexuality they've you know talked to

316
00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.940
their friends and family they're
comfortable about it and they're ready

317
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.799
this isn't someone who is ready to come
out publicly this is someone who is

318
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:40.620
being pushed out of the closet
and that's not something that we should

319
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.820
do
ever like

320
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.799
I think there are some exceptions that
can be made for say republican

321
00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:53.340
politicians that we know are gay that we
have proof that are gay and they are

322
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.200
voting for anti-gay bills for anti-trans
bills stuff like that

323
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.900
I'm not going to say don't out them
because then from their voter base

324
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.500
they're not going to get reelected
so

325
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.279
you know
that's one less person who is actively

326
00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:15.600
hurting the Community kit Connor was not
hurting the community

327
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.380
none of the actors who I know are gay
are hurting the community by not being

328
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.039
out
in fact most of them raise money for the

329
00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:31.980
community for Charities like um trans
lifeline and things like that and the

330
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.539
Trevor Project
and even though they're not out they do

331
00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:40.220
a lot to raise money for causes in the
community

332
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.600
and you know so they're doing their part
because they can't come out just because

333
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.520
of the industry they're in
and it's a toxic industry ask

334
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.500
any woman who was ever in a room with
Harvey Weinstein they will tell you just

335
00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.960
how toxic this industry can be
um

336
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.740
and
so there's been a huge reaction online

337
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.600
to this as you can imagine a lot of
people gloating

338
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.520
kind of saying like yeah we got him to
come out yay he's out yay and it's like

339
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.240
okay yay he's bisexual what do you think
he's gonna date you

340
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.320
like do you think you you're get you're
getting something out of this other than

341
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.100
the the joy of outing an 18 year old
that you don't know

342
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.240
um
Alice oseman the creator of Heart

343
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.000
Stopper
um

344
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.960
uh put out a statement saying I truly
don't understand how people can watch

345
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.880
Heart Stopper and then gleefully spend
their time speculating about sexualities

346
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.279
and judging based on stereotypes I hope
all those people are embarrassed as F

347
00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:55.320
kit you are amazing
uh and then went on to say if Heart

348
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.620
Stopper helps a young queer person in
their coming out journey or if it helps

349
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.159
a parent understand their child a little
bit better it is the most lovely and

350
00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:07.559
heartwarming thing you could hear and
makes it feel like it's all worth it

351
00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:09.900
um
actually I think she may have said that

352
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.840
earlier
um

353
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.740
kit Connor also said
to have a show where you see queer

354
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.460
people being happy and being together
and United as a group I think there's

355
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.260
something really beautiful about that I
think that shows like euphoria that are

356
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.179
very queer and still very much sort of
adult in many ways because they are very

357
00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:33.840
dark and gritty I think it's really
important to have a show that is just

358
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.320
portraying queer love and queer Beauty
and I believe yeah pretty sure he said

359
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.760
this before this happened
um like on the original press tour

360
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.640
um
because that's one of the nice things

361
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.500
that people have loved about
heartstopper is that it's not that it is

362
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:56.039
something that you know
you can feel as a queer teenager or

363
00:29:56.039 --> 00:30:00.179
pre even preteen you can feel
comfortable watching Heart Stopper with

364
00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:03.720
your parents if you know your parents
are accepting

365
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.200
um you can feel comfortable watching it
with them because you know there's not

366
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.760
going to be you know a random dick
popping up somewhere it's usually not

367
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.419
dicks but you know a random sex scene
um

368
00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:19.679
that's just like gratuitous
um

369
00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:25.740
or you know other
like heavy drug use and stuff like that

370
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.159
like it's something you can watch with
your family it's something that your

371
00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:35.460
grandparents can watch and be like oh
oh it's just they just fall in love like

372
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.700
that and it it like I've seen so many
stories on Twitter and Instagram and

373
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.039
Tumblr about people getting their
grandparents to watch Heart Stopper and

374
00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:50.940
suddenly their grandparents aren't so
homophobic anymore

375
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:57.419
you know maybe it doesn't convert them
to being 100 on our side but you know it

376
00:30:57.419 --> 00:31:01.320
opens the conversation and so and
there's lots of people who don't like

377
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.760
Heart Stopper and that's perfectly fine
it's not for everyone it is very sweet

378
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.059
it's like it's like the sweetest candy
it is not for everybody

379
00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:16.740
um I've only been able to watch it once
all the way through because it is so

380
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.960
sweet
um

381
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:27.360
that it's almost painful for my uh
frustrated 33 year old haven't had a

382
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.980
boyfriend in 10 years heart to be able
to watch it but

383
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.320
um you know it just it gives it it's
this happy place

384
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:44.460
and now this happy place
is being infused with this

385
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.860
again toxicity
from people who aren't seeing the

386
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.840
message they're not looking at
kit Connor's character

387
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.340
and seeing his slow Evolution well
that's slow because it's not that long a

388
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.700
season but his Evolution across the
season coming to terms with his

389
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.760
bisexuality
um

390
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.000
you know
coming to terms with the fact that he

391
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.860
likes boys is he gay is he bisexual
figuring out okay he's bisexual and then

392
00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.700
coming and then on his own terms in his
own time coming out to people and coming

393
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.140
out to his mom and stuff like that that
they watch that and they see this

394
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.279
bisexual character be able to do that in
their own time

395
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:33.899
and then they look at the per literal
the literal person playing that

396
00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:37.980
character
and they say but you don't get to have

397
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:43.799
that you don't get to have that you need
to do it on my time you need to do it

398
00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:48.899
when I say you need to do it uh
yesterday

399
00:32:48.899 --> 00:32:53.820
because you shouldn't have been cast in
this role if you aren't queer

400
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.559
and
you know it's and then that brings up

401
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:06.360
the the the big argument about should
you know should we really really be

402
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.960
focusing on casting queer actors in
queer roles

403
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.580
um because then
it kind of raises the question okay well

404
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.260
how many queer actors are not going to
get queer roles because they're not out

405
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.600
uh because they're you know in an
industry that for the most part won't

406
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.080
allow them to be out
um

407
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.440
and
that is a problem and it's something

408
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.240
worth discussing
I don't have the answer for that

409
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.480
um
I've I've never even

410
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.519
been forced to kind of reckon with my
gayness because I came out I figured out

411
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.840
I was gay when I was
like I figured out what gay was and that

412
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.659
that's what I was at about 11 and I came
out at 12. and it wasn't like I came out

413
00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:02.760
to myself I came out to my friends my
family my grandparents just everybody I

414
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.019
had I didn't have the patience to wait
um

415
00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:11.040
because I expected there to be this you
know amazing gay community to pop up to

416
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.679
support this 12 year old that didn't
happen

417
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.560
um
and

418
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.119
which is probably
for the better when you really think

419
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:23.280
about it
um

420
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.240
but

421
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.760
so I I've never had to kind of worry
about it and

422
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.740
Eve but even when I've when I was
working in marketing and things like

423
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:43.320
that when I would start at a firm
I I wouldn't mention that I was gay I I

424
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:50.700
wouldn't because you don't know
the opinion of the people

425
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:56.399
who really decide
whether or not you get to make a living

426
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:59.280
and
you know

427
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.619
in Canada where I am it is illegal to
fire someone for being gay

428
00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:09.119
but there's always a way they can come
up with a different reason

429
00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:14.119
you know they don't have to say oh I
fired him because he's gay it can be

430
00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:19.320
well he showed up late a lot and it's
like well how where's the proof of that

431
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:26.400
there doesn't really need to be proof no
no one's going to demand proof of that

432
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.160
um
which is why I'm so thankful for you

433
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.140
know being able to make YouTube videos
because as frustrating as YouTube is and

434
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.359
can be with queer creators
um it is a place that I can be myself

435
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:44.400
and I don't have to hide myself to be
able to

436
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.720
um you know make a living
and

437
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.599
that is a great
um

438
00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:59.940
weight off of my shoulders
that most actors in Hollywood

439
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.960
specifically it's different everywhere I
know it's a lot easier to be out in

440
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.760
England uh the England the English
acting scene for instance

441
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.839
um
but when you're trying to work in

442
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:16.140
Hollywood
it's very hard

443
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.680
to just
come out

444
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.400
because no matter how big your fan base
is no matter what kind of franchise

445
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:31.440
you're in you never know
which old white male executive

446
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.180
is gonna look at you and say
well I don't think you can make us money

447
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:43.079
anymore so I'm not even gonna try
and so now this 18 year old kid

448
00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:49.280
who is incredibly talented the boy can
sing and the boy can act

449
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.660
and is incredibly talented
and is on this show that is making

450
00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:01.740
people incredibly happy
has now been backed into this corner

451
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.859
where
he may have just if not

452
00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:12.060
I think I think he has a fan base that
is AVID enough

453
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.380
that it won't torpedo his career
a Heart Stopper has been such a hit for

454
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.560
Netflix if nothing else Netflix will put
him in stuff

455
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.859
but
you know will

456
00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:26.599
possibly have hurt his career

457
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.160
just because
he has had to

458
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:38.220
acquiesce
to these online [ __ ]

459
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:45.240
demanding an 18 year old
divulge

460
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:52.280
you know what for a lot of people is
very personal information

461
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.020
um
you know even if he was in a different

462
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.099
industry like if he if he wasn't an
actor if he wasn't a singer or anything

463
00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:02.760
like that if he was just working in I
don't know insurance

464
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.220
it's not fair to force anyone

465
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.000
out of the closet
when they are not if they are not being

466
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.880
you know
uh a force for bad for the community

467
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.079
like I said gay Republicans and stuff
um

468
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:25.440
who are in the closet and voting against
gay rights and trans rights and just

469
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.480
being horrible
um

470
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.660
most
people

471
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.280
most gay people are not
elected officials voting against their

472
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.260
own rights
most are not

473
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.020
and so like you know I'm focused on
Hollywood because that is the situation

474
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.579
at hand
a very talented young actor

475
00:38:47.579 --> 00:38:51.960
may have just had his career ended and
that might be being dramatic because

476
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.640
like I said Netflix is going to keep him
around because he is very popular

477
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.000
um
and Netflix has had you know Netflix has

478
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.720
had its problems with queer rep with
queer stuff but they they have produced

479
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.980
a lot of queer content
um

480
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.660
but
he may have just really hurt what could

481
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:17.880
have been movie stardom
like

482
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.740
you know getting into the Marvel movies
maybe playing hulkling or something like

483
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:28.619
that in the Young Avengers or you know
getting into you know just Blockbusters

484
00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:32.760
or big Hollywood movies and Oscar movies
something whatever

485
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.880
um

486
00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:41.520
that may have
put the brakes on that for him

487
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:48.079
because of these [ __ ] who feel like
he owes them something

488
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.420
because he's
a public figure

489
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.440
they know who he is
they want to know if he's gay because

490
00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.240
he's gay or bi or queer because he's
playing a queer character he's playing a

491
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.800
bisexual character so they want to know
they want to know if he deserves their

492
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.859
respect they want to know if he deserves
their admiration because how dare he

493
00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:18.599
expect them to not disqualify him
for doing an amazing job playing a

494
00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:22.339
character that helped a lot of people

495
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:30.420
that alone is not enough for them
he has to justify that

496
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.619
by
telling them

497
00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:41.640
I am what you need me to be
what you specifically need me to be

498
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.740
and the Really heartbreaking part about
it is that they're a minority

499
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:54.740
a very loud toxic minority
and

500
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.220
you know kit Connor is not the first
person that they have come for

501
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.760
um they have come for plenty of people
in the past

502
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.940
and he's just the most recent and
I think probably the most high profile

503
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:14.900
because her Heart Stopper has been so
popular

504
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:22.020
and it's just really sad seeing this
it's sad because I I don't know if it's

505
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.000
if it's coming from the gay community
and you know if it's coming from the

506
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.359
queer community and we're demanding this
of him

507
00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:35.820
if it's coming from
straight viewers who feel like they're

508
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:41.460
doing the right thing by you know uh
forcing him out of the closet

509
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.800
because you know he should stand up with
the gay community and all this kind of

510
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.760
stuff
I don't know if it's you know

511
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:56.520
fan girls who want to know whether or
not they'll ever get to be with him or

512
00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.300
if it's Fanboys who ever want to know if
they'll be with him

513
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:05.400
um I can answer that for all of them
in all of you if any of you are

514
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.020
listening no you're never going to be
with him

515
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.420
um whether he's you know he's bisexual
but whether he was gay straight bisexual

516
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:23.040
uh pansexual asexual aromantic whatever
you are never going to you know be his

517
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.300
boyfriend or be his girlfriend

518
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:33.300
so I don't know why you felt you had
so much

519
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.800
personal
stake in this

520
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.480
to force this 18 year old kid out of the
closet

521
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:49.619
at a very precarious time in his life
a maker literally a make or break time

522
00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:52.339
for his career

523
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:58.980
and I'm just hoping that
his fan base rallies around him and from

524
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.520
what I'm seeing on Twitter they are
um

525
00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:12.180
um he's got just on that tweet he's got
23 right as of right now he's got 23 000

526
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.839
replies
the vast mode I haven't obviously I

527
00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:18.839
haven't gone through all of them but of
the vast majority that I've read have

528
00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:24.540
been very positive
uh supporting him and apologizing

529
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:30.660
for the faceless masses that demanded he
come out uh and 405

530
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.460
000 likes
so

531
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.260
he's got his fan base he's got his fans
he's

532
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.800
he's also got you know Alice oseman
behind him

533
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:50.579
who's becoming you know a kind of a stir
creator with Netflix now

534
00:43:50.579 --> 00:43:54.119
um with Heart Stopper being so popular
and they want to work with her on other

535
00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:58.020
projects
um I want to work with them with other

536
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.339
projects I apologize
um

537
00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:08.700
and you know he has had talks with
um pretty big pretty big studios in

538
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.040
Hollywood pretty big production
companies and some pretty big Executives

539
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:21.380
and I'm hoping that this
doesn't put the brakes on all of that

540
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.079
I like I said I think there's going to
be people there to support him no matter

541
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:32.460
what
um if the brakes are put on there will

542
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:38.280
be people at Netflix there'll be people
like Alice oseman who will be there to

543
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.579
you know
keep them going

544
00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:47.579
hopefully you know someone like maybe
Zendaya who you know can help him do a

545
00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:51.119
get him in Spider-Man or something I
don't know

546
00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:55.500
um
you know just

547
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:02.520
I just hope that
this really talented kid doesn't have

548
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:09.300
his career destroyed because of some
[ __ ] on the internet

549
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:15.540
because it may sound hyperbolic
very recently

550
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.359
careers have been destroyed because of
people coming out

551
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.720
um
and careers that looked very promising

552
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.380
disappeared

553
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.490
so
that's my thoughts on this

554
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.140
[Music]
um

555
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.040
thank you for listening

556
00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:40.380
I would love to hear what you think
about it in the comments

557
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.540
be respectful
and uh

558
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.940
again thank you so much for listening
and uh

559
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.020
I'll have a new video coming out soon
thank you for watching my most recent

560
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.920
ones I really appreciate it
and if you're one of those people on the

561
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.280
internet who has been demanding the kick
Connor come out

562
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:07.859
I feel like you should maybe do some
self-reflection

563
00:46:07.859 --> 00:46:14.119
of what
you expect from queer people
