00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.260
we all like True Crime if the glut of
True Crime series is any indication it's

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.740
very suddenly become one of the most
engaging forms of contemporary

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
entertainment
and there's no sign of it stopping from

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.000
streaming to YouTube to networks to
podcasts it seems the genre has yet to

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.400
find its saturation point in 2022 True
Crime shows are among Netflix's most

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.420
watched and the number of True Crime
shows on Netflix is rapidly growing

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.899
between July of 2020 and March of 2021
the service launched 18 such series with

8
00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.160
around 40 original shows currently
available to watch on their true crime

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.719
page since the release of into the deep
and other popular documentaries on the

10
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.920
service in recent years such as don't
cats making a murderer and Tiger King

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.840
Netflix has become particularly
associated with the genre while True

12
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
Crime shows were once favored by older
audiences with shows like Dateline and

13
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
2020 targeting those demographics
specifically they're now becoming

14
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
increasingly popular among people my age
and younger

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.439
and they raise a number of ethical
questions

16
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.340
particularly
for a streaming service like Netflix the

17
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.500
true crime series you put on to help you
go to sleep at night it's about a real

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
person often who have surviving
relatives who don't consider their

19
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
deceased loved ones murder to be very
relaxing

20
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.360
though we may know better we devour
every serving of this genre that is

21
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.020
provided to us in no small measure by
Netflix in September of 2022 Ryan Murphy

22
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.340
and Ian Brennan released monster the
Jeffrey Dahmer story starring Evan

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.159
Peters as the titular serial killer over
196 million hours of the show were

24
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.240
watched in the first week alone making
it the most popular show on the

25
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.740
streaming service at the time of release
furthermore just like Joe Exotic the

26
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.240
Tiger King Dahmer has received a great
deal of publicity

27
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.680
for all the wrong reasons

28
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:39.180
[Music]
foreign

29
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.009
[Music]

30
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.140
despite Netflix's claims that the series
will give notorious serial killer

31
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.519
Jeffrey Dahmer's victims a voice the
show received harsh criticism for its

32
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.140
portrayal of the victims upon its debut
with several of the victims loved ones

33
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.060
speaking out saying Netflix didn't even
involve them in the process others have

34
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.440
said that by hiring American Horror
Stories Evan Peters the object of many a

35
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.480
girls and gay boys affection the show
has glamorized Dahmer himself after the

36
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.900
Netflix series premiered and Peter's
portrayal of the character went viral

37
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.560
the actual glasses that Dahmer wore in
prison

38
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.480
were auctioned off for a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars we've romanced

39
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200
the serial killer for a long time mads
Mickelson's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter

40
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.440
and the criminally canceled show
Hannibal is a great example of this

41
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.519
Thomas Harris's bread and butter
character is fictional and not only

42
00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.099
fictional but such a carnivalesque mix
of sophistication intellect and

43
00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.659
brutality that I couldn't really say it
passes for realistic Hannibal lacks the

44
00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.799
quiet chaos that real-life serial
killers possess though Dahmer was also a

45
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.760
cannibal serial killer he lacked the eat
the rude principles that Hannibal Lecter

46
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.840
lived by hardly a principled serial
killer himself Dahmer lacked lectures

47
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.960
discipline to stop at just cannibalism
and also engaged in necrophilia and

48
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040
pedophilia but the major difference
between the two is that Hannibal

49
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.020
lecter's victims are all as fictional as
he is and so are the families of his

50
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.280
victims that is not the case for
Dahmer's victims it can be a lot to deal

51
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.020
with seeing the man who murdered your
son and her brother be glorified on

52
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.360
billboards and ads on YouTube imagine
getting that jump scare when you're

53
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.919
looking up a cake decorating tutorial
navigating the ethics of True Crime

54
00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.139
content is tricky there is a fine line
drawn between real life procedural cop

55
00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.720
dramas and celebrating the infamous
critics have begun to question the need

56
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.160
for entertainment mediums which
fetishize or even sexualize serial

57
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.419
killers in the last three years alone
we've seen multiple films about Ted

58
00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.580
Bundy with two of them coming from
Netflix one of them starring Zac Efron a

59
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.320
whole new generation of girls fell head
over heels for the infamous killer which

60
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.000
was a grim remake in itself of the
real-life Ted Bundy trial he had

61
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.740
fangirls defending him in the press and
even begging to marry him after the

62
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.660
release of the Zac Efron movie extremely
Wicked shockingly evil and vile

63
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.460
Netflix's social media team actually
begged viewers to stop standing Bundy

64
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.660
but unlike Bundy
nobody ever thirsted for Jeffrey Dahmer

65
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.820
when he was on trial or in prison
at least not as publicly as with Bundy

66
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.060
but that seems to have changed now there
is a thirst for Dahmer made apparent on

67
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.500
Tick Tock and Twitter with hordes of
white women droning over how attractive

68
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.199
he is because the message we need to
send is that violent crime can turn a

69
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.539
five into an 11. again both Bundy and
Dahmer were serial killers who tortured

70
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.560
and murdered dozens of people whose
families are still alive and can see

71
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.440
these tweets and posts on Tick Tock the
Dahmer tag on Tick Tock now has more

72
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.539
than one billion views with users
posting videos expressing lust and even

73
00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.560
Sympathy for the killer others have
re-edited scenes from the series to

74
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.180
resemble a romantic comedy with many
users commenting that they were rooting

75
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.100
for Dahmer and at least one victim to
live happily ever after oh God that

76
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.759
sounds familiar

77
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
foreign

78
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.479
of 2021 I released a video looking at
the controversial Korean manwa killing

79
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.280
stalking the story of a young man who is
abducted by a maniacal serial killer and

80
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.180
over the course of the series Falls
madly in love with him the series ends

81
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.319
with them both presumed dead the
audience for killing stalking seemed to

82
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:12.479
be split between people who enjoy dark
complex horror stories me and teenage

83
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.340
girls who were rooting for Yoon bum and
his captor osun Wu

84
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.960
to come out of it as a happy couple
because if you talk to a social worker

85
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.120
working out your problems with a violent
abuser and finding some common ground is

86
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.720
absolutely not the objective I wasn't
Disturbed that people romanticized a

87
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.380
fictional serial killer like I said
Hannibal Lecter has been romanticized

88
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.240
even by his own Creator granted fanables
were a little bit more

89
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.440
measured in their shipping of Will
Graham and Hannibal Lecter a ship name

90
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.699
referred to as hanogram instances of
Will and Hannibal as a happy couple were

91
00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.900
usually depicted in alternate realities
where they could be together fans

92
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.220
recognized that this was impossible in
the canonical world the characters lived

93
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.900
in but the chemistry was so intense in
AU for them had to be created this

94
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.840
Nuance did not
does not seem to be present in much of

95
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.099
the killing stalking fandom where the
fervor for the violent deranged serial

96
00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:21.180
killer osongwoo was almost exclusively
derived from how sexy he looked so

97
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.220
should I be surprised that there is a
visceral thirst for Dahmer coming from

98
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.900
the same age group no
am I shocked anyway

99
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.700
yes
shocked and disappointed and grossed out

100
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.620
and uncomfortable because unlike
Hannibal Lecter or osongwoo Jeffrey

101
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.360
Dahmer was a real person and his victims
were real people with real friends and

102
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.080
real families who grieved for the loss
of their loved ones who were already

103
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.040
going through a rough time seeing the
story of their murders brought back to

104
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.080
light by a major Netflix series and now
have to deal with a sizable portion of

105
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.940
the internet
talking about how cute or handsome

106
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.480
Jeffrey Dahmer was and how he deserved a
break because

107
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:16.080
they get him Honeys among other things
he wanted sex slaves

108
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.899
sex slaves and not in a fun consensual
Kink kind of a way he enjoyed conducting

109
00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:27.300
chemical lobotomies to get what he
wanted is there really a I can change

110
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.920
him mentality to approaching these
serial killers that all he needs is the

111
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.120
right person to change that killing
people and the other stuff is just a

112
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.480
little Quirk that you can iron out I
know women who have been trying to get

113
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.720
their men to wash their beard trimmings
out of the bathroom sink for years with

114
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.140
no luck I don't know where you think
you're gonna get with stop being a

115
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.300
psycho the True Crime genre has rightly
received its fair share of criticism for

116
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.320
turning gruesome crimes into
entertainment at the expense of the

117
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.120
well-being of survivors and perhaps
there needs to be real action taken to

118
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.220
address that however this delusional
wave of people announcing that they are

119
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.920
not disturbed by Dahmer's crimes
feels like a whole new level of

120
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.480
desensitization they even say that the
things we see him doing in the series

121
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.399
really aren't that bad Dahmer is just a
little boy with doe eyes misunderstood

122
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:25.500
by everyone but them
they're not like other girls they can

123
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.880
handle a 14 year old boy getting
dismembered is this a problem with media

124
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.920
itself has the American pop culture
fiction cycle pushed the role of the

125
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.740
main character to be something
warranting empathy and understanding

126
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.720
without exception among the tropes
structures and sensibilities of American

127
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.100
fiction is it just automatically taken
for granted that the main character is

128
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.360
an empathizable figure whose role
through any despicable actions is

129
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.800
ultimately Redemption one of the parts
of this odd phenomenon that I've noticed

130
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.700
is that while girls of a certain age are
acting like Jeffrey Dahmer was Harry

131
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.140
Styles not everyone is lining up with
them and by everyone

132
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.220
I mean the gays
you know

133
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.300
his victims

134
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.839
wigays are notorious for thirsting over
guys we really shouldn't and also for

135
00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:24.120
being obsessed with True Crime but this
seems to be one of the few exceptions

136
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.899
and for good reason gay men have been
living under the shadow of Jeffrey

137
00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:32.700
Dahmer for as long as I've been alive as
the AIDS crisis was running rampant in

138
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.200
the community was only just starting to
receive any large-scale sympathy from

139
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.720
the hetero majority up Pops the news of
this gay male serial killer who isn't

140
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.220
just killing his victims but zombifying
them eating them

141
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.920
and melting their bodies in Vats of acid
he was a harsh example of what straight

142
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.779
people always said we were that we were
deviants and monsters never to be

143
00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:01.320
trusted
and he was the perfect poster child for

144
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.820
this a nearly unparalleled monster
nobody talked about the fact that the

145
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.959
reason he got away with his crimes for
so long was because he was targeting gay

146
00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:15.180
men especially men of color two groups
the police notoriously couldn't give two

147
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.500
shits about helping people only talked
about the cannibal queer

148
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.320
and how certainly he wouldn't be the
last to rise up to this prominence the

149
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.399
most disturbing aspect is how he was
able to carry on his career for as long

150
00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:34.260
as he did by picking gay men of color he
was able to escape the scrutiny of law

151
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.260
enforcement Dahmer for this reason
is an uncomfortable reminder not only of

152
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.579
violence against the community but that
members of the community can be a

153
00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:49.980
horrible detriment to our reputation and
a reminder that not very long ago we

154
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:55.440
weren't worth the Law's time
that we were nobodies to everybody

155
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.620
and it didn't matter how loud we
screamed

156
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.480
the world had us on mute and in many
sections of the United States this fear

157
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.800
of gay men never went away even today
these people are influenced by Dahmer

158
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.200
when they fight against gay rights they
associate his heinous crimes with others

159
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.760
in the queer community
because if one of us could be a monster

160
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.160
that means we all could be after the
discovery of Dahmer's crimes there was a

161
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.260
rash of hate crimes against gay men
across the United States with vigilante

162
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.700
mobs out to make sure that the next
Jeffrey Dahmer the next Monster queer

163
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.380
wouldn't get a chance to find his
victims and so the queer Community

164
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.019
especially gay men have lived with
Dahmer Specter for three decades

165
00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:46.800
so you'd be hard-pressed to find a lot
of gay men thirsting over the killer

166
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.700
online Evan Peters yes we've been
drooling over him since he first showed

167
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:57.240
up in American Horror Story but not the
actual Jeffrey Dahmer and not Evan

168
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.700
peters's portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer in
fact there was a huge pushback when the

169
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.040
series was released because it was
tagged as lgbtq on Netflix presumably

170
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.060
because of Dahmer's own sexuality and
the sexualities of his victims but while

171
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.560
the queer Community fights back against
A Renewed push to remove our rights do

172
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.779
we want people seeing lgbtq tagged to
Jeffrey [ __ ] Dahmer when they're

173
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:26.820
browsing Netflix
no and so the community in a rare moment

174
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.000
of agreement demanded Netflix remove the
tag

175
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.040
and they did which considering Netflix's
pig-headedness when it comes to

176
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.660
defending transphobic comedians on their
platform kind of shocked me they're not

177
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.199
exactly well known for doing what the
queer Community asks of them these days

178
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:46.920
they probably had the wherewithal to
realize that Dahmer's existence as a

179
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.720
serial killer was due in large part to
homophobia and racism so they didn't

180
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.860
want to stick their hand into that
particular Hornet's Nest this is a

181
00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.360
telling that at least doesn't completely
ignore Dahmer's effect on the gay black

182
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.899
community they've had to dodge a lot of
queer-related controversies this year

183
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:08.760
this is among one of the easier ones to
resolve typical accounts of his murder

184
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.360
spree usually Overlook the fact the
queer communities of color were easy

185
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.040
targets for Dahmer due to long-standing
patterns of police violence and

186
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.660
especially indifference in major cities
across the Midwest similar to what

187
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.920
happened in many cities after World War
II Milwaukee where Dahmer committed the

188
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.480
majority of his murders saw an increase
in the visibility of its gay community

189
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.500
nearly a thousand gay men called
Milwaukee home according to a study

190
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.339
conducted by the city's influential
crime prevention body the Metropolitan

191
00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:42.899
Commission on crime prevention during
the war as words spread about them

192
00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:46.980
more arrests and convictions were made
in the city during this time the city's

193
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.540
black population also grew as a result
of the Second Great Migration an exodus

194
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.139
of African Americans from the south
spurred by The increased demand for

195
00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:59.040
manufacturing Goods during the second
world war Milwaukee cops happily

196
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.279
targeted these new growing communities
as well

197
00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:08.399
in spite of the fact that they were
directly contributing

198
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:13.440
to the war effort
the media also played a role in the

199
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.220
criminalization of City residents who
were seen as leading immoral Lifestyles

200
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.660
the Milwaukee journal's editorials from
the 1940s frequently used terms like

201
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.100
slaves of lust and Menace of sex
perverts to describe the emerging gay

202
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.279
community it also supported the
Metropolitan Commission on crime

203
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:34.699
prevention's 1946
sexual psychopath law which would have

204
00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:40.139
institutionalized overt homosexuals
until their deviant Behavior was cured

205
00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:45.000
or otherwise
otherwise meaning dead to defuse the

206
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.139
threat of a growing minority presence
these sexual psychopath laws were

207
00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:53.220
introduced and passed in places like
Milwaukee as the gay community grew in

208
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.519
prominence
and as more African-Americans relocated

209
00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.740
there black people were not safe from
these sexual psychopath laws because as

210
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.120
far as police were concerned interracial
relationships were just as bad as gay

211
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.839
ones because of the city's changing
demographics Milwaukee's police

212
00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:15.059
department created new units to better
defend white straight residents from

213
00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:20.100
black and other minority groups in the
1960s the fifth Police District in the

214
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.480
city's predominantly black North Side
had four and a half times as many

215
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.679
officers as the adjacent majority white
District this kind of Terror against

216
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:33.480
black Milwaukee residents created a
culture of fear and distrust between the

217
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.100
police and black and queer people who
often hesitated to report crimes

218
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.900
committed against them which helps
explain how someone like Dahmer could go

219
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.059
relatively unnoticed or unpunished for
so long plus a municipal statute from

220
00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:53.220
1911 called the freeloader Clause barred
people who did not own property from

221
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.480
filing complaints against the police
with the fire and police commission so

222
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.580
many black renters assumed their cries
for help would fall on deaf ears these

223
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.820
long histories of anti-black and
anti-queer violence created in an

224
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.039
environment where Dahmer could murder 17
black indigenous Asian Latino and gay

225
00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:16.140
men and boys with little pushback many
were particularly susceptible to Dahmer

226
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.539
and his tactics because of Decades of
the city's structured racism and

227
00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:26.039
homophobia today we know that there were
many instances in which the police could

228
00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:30.360
have intervened but did not
in one instance officers John A

229
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.460
balserzak and Joseph gabrish had the
opportunity to rescue a disoriented

230
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.059
unclothed and bleeding 14 year old boy
from Dahmer

231
00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:43.500
however they took the killer at his word
that the child was actually 19 and just

232
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.520
drunk
no probing no investigation although

233
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.780
balser Zach and gabrish were eventually
fired for their actions they were

234
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.840
reinstated with back pay in 1994.
balserzak had a long career in the

235
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.500
police department serving as president
of the Milwaukee Police Association from

236
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:10.799
2005 to 2009 before retiring in 2017.
2017 five years ago and people question

237
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:15.840
why Pride organizations don't want
police officers to participate in

238
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.679
uniform over the years and the many
retellings of the Dahmer story his

239
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:24.720
victims have been described as Street
urchins drug addicts and people not

240
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.340
unfamiliar with their own brushes with
the law as if that should justify the

241
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.120
heinous things done to them creating a
sense that they were far from innocent

242
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.400
victims allows most people to look at
the crime spree as the actions of one

243
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.780
queer psychopath if he only targets
people who have it coming then there's

244
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.679
no cause for concern if you live by the
straight and narrow

245
00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:50.960
regardless of how this betrays malice
and laziness on the police force

246
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.280
culminating in decades of police abuse
and neglect how many other people

247
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.600
disappear because the police don't think
they're worth their time how many that

248
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.000
we never ever hear about it was almost a
Trope in the gay Villages of big cities

249
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.780
young gay men and trans people just
going missing and no one investigating

250
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.260
it
many hoped they'd just packed up and

251
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.059
moved home but most knew it was never
something quite so innocent

252
00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:22.380
talk to the elders in your local queer
community

253
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.100
they remember

254
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.460
but even with all of this knowledge of
neglect heartbreak disappearances lost

255
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.179
and destroyed lives all of it freely
available to anyone who can type Google

256
00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:40.080
into an internet browser The Thirst for
Dahmer is real

257
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.679
despite his cannibalism despite the
decades-long Erasure of his victims

258
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:48.960
these women and mostly teenage girls are
swooning over him

259
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.520
and why not to our knowledge Dahmer
never killed any teenage girls or any

260
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.000
women at all so there's a level of
disconnection just like with killing

261
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.600
stalking would the teenage fans of
killing stalking be so in love with osun

262
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.919
Wu if they were watching him spend each
issue horrifically torturing and

263
00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:10.679
murdering a woman he kills women in the
series multiple in fact but they're

264
00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:14.880
barely Side characters
Yoon bum is the main event and in my

265
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.919
opinion because Yoon bum is a man female
readers are able to take in a horror

266
00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:23.700
story without facing the true horror of
it because unfortunately to this day

267
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.960
many women still see gay men as nothing
more than a fancy accessory especially

268
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.179
teenage girls who lust for the perfect
gay best friend a boy whose sex life is

269
00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:37.140
secret so you never have to hear about
it but he's always there to tell you if

270
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.240
your boyfriend's being a jerk gay men
and boys as a purse or a fancy iPhone

271
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.220
case something to show off but
ultimately something disposable and we

272
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.360
get an extra layer of that with Dahmer's
victims since the vast majority of them

273
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.700
were not white but the vast majority of
Dahmer's thirsters online are a white

274
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.240
there's further license for
disconnection they get to look at them

275
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.400
even less like people than if they were
white gay men it's telling

276
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.159
that the person fans ship Dahmer with
the most is Stephen Hicks his first and

277
00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:16.200
whitest victim and while I am far from
opposed to queer villains in media I do

278
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.140
wonder how smart it is to drop this
story

279
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.640
onto such a large platform when the gay
community is already seeing an increase

280
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.320
in hate crimes and anti-gay laws across
the United States the media's initial

281
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.059
reporting on the Dahmer case was
entangled in a subtle but pervasive

282
00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:38.100
homophobic logic even as it denied
having any such effect lesbian and gay

283
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.360
activists in Milwaukee and elsewhere
protested strongly against initial

284
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.799
references to the Dahmer murders as
homosexual Overkill by public officials

285
00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:51.360
and the mainstream press arguing that
Dahmer's actions were no more

286
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.020
representative of the homosexual
Community than the killings of a

287
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.740
heterosexual serial killer would be
representative of the heterosexual

288
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.860
Community thus the term homosexual
Overkill served to normalize

289
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:09.020
heterosexuality even heterosexual serial
killers while pathologizing

290
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.440
homosexuality the media is surprisingly
responded quickly to the protests and

291
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.400
the phrase homosexual Overkill was
quickly removed from coverage of the

292
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.679
case in fact it appears that the media
became so concerned that their reports

293
00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:26.820
not appear homophobic that they largely
dropped any mention of Dahmer's sexual

294
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.140
orientation even at Dahmer's trial his
sexual orientation barely registered as

295
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.700
an issue those who advocated for gay
assimilation praised this development

296
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.960
according to this line of thinking
bringing up Dahmer sexuality and media

297
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.460
coverage of the murders was
inappropriate because it had nothing to

298
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:50.280
do with why he became a serial killer
but if Dahmer's sexual orientation could

299
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.900
not be mentioned
neither could institutional homophobia

300
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.559
which was a problem given the
overwhelming evidence that Dahmer had

301
00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:03.600
internalized societal homophobia to such
an extent that he felt guilt shame

302
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.059
discomfort and hatred about his own
homosexuality a logical though extreme

303
00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:14.700
result of these feelings could have been
the urge to kill those to whom he was

304
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.799
sexually attracted in a Twisted way I
could perhaps understand how someone

305
00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:26.340
would think that having male zombies for
sex and sex only would separate him

306
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.900
from all the other trappings of the gay
lifestyle however with his sexuality out

307
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.340
of the question society would have to
take no blame for the killings the few

308
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.600
reporters who did discuss homophobia and
Dahmer's gayness mostly in LGBT

309
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.120
magazines tended to ignore the fact that
Dahmer was white the reluctance to

310
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.679
discuss interracial sex in light of the
Dahmer murders can be interpreted as a

311
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:55.740
sign of Shame and fear of having one's
sexual orientation linked to racism or

312
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.940
both according to several of Dahmer's
acquaintances he displayed a deep-seated

313
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.960
bigotry toward African Americans and
made racist comments about black gay men

314
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.500
in particular while authorities and the
media learned to avoid making over

315
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.000
references to Dahmer sexual orientation
in their official portrayals of him

316
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.400
Dahmer himself made use of what we might
call gay rights strategies as his career

317
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.539
as a serial killer gained momentum these
actions along with the media's delayed

318
00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:25.919
coverage of Dahmer sexual orientation
highlights the inadequacies and

319
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:30.419
potential social hazards of the
neoliberal gay rights rhetoric he used

320
00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:34.260
his gayness to his Advantage when
convicted of sexual assault in the

321
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.779
enticing of a child for immoral purposes
in 1989 he came out to the judge

322
00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:44.820
afterwards the judge sentenced him to
five years probation and one year in the

323
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.500
House of Corrections with work release
permitted in order so that he wouldn't

324
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.400
lose his job at this point he had
already killed five people he would kill

325
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.100
12 more before finally being caught and
convicted in 1978 he had killed Stephen

326
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.020
Mark Hicks an 18 year old by Dahmer's
admission he was bludgeoned with a

327
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.500
dumbbell and strangled to death before
being dismembered

328
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.480
remains were pulverized and Scattered
behind Dahmer's childhood home in 1987

329
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.799
he killed Stephen Walter Toomey his body
was dismembered in the basement of

330
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:21.659
Dahmer's grandmother's house and the
remains discarded in the trash in 1988

331
00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:25.799
he killed two men
James Edward Duck's daughter a 14 year

332
00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:30.840
old and Richard Guerrero in 1989 he
killed Anthony Lee Sears after the

333
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.659
murder Dahmer preserved his skull and
genitals in a filing cabinet in 1990 he

334
00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:40.020
killed Raymond Lamont Smith Edward
Warren Smith

335
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:45.539
Ernest Marquez Miller and David Courtney

336
00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:50.520
killed Curtis Strader Errol Lindsay on
April 7th Tony Hughes on May 24th Conor

Joseph bradhoft on July 19th and then

339
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.559
was finally arrested on July 23rd does
this sound like the man anyone let alone

340
00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:11.940
teenage girls should be lusting over
having a thing for serial killers isn't

341
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.600
new and it hasn't risen up just because
of shows on Netflix there are several

342
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.020
online communities such as blogs and
message boards where fans of serial

343
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.740
killers like Bundy and Dahmer and
Richard Ramirez and others expressed

344
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:28.679
their adoration for these individuals
as if they may be a pop star however as

345
00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:32.580
evidenced by the statements made by the
families of Dahmer's victims and the

346
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.659
show's proclivity for trying to
understand the killer rather than to

347
00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:40.799
tell the stories of his victims simply
because the killer was a moderately

348
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:45.120
attractive white man
maybe adaptations of these stories can

349
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.400
arguably create more harm than good
this is much worse than the situation

350
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.299
with killing stalking
because although The Thirst was and is

351
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:59.940
real for osongwoo he like Hannibal
Lecter before him was a fictional

352
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.580
character who never actually hurt anyone
the creation of an artist is a

353
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.720
commentary on our willingness to forgive
nearly anything if someone is attractive

354
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.240
but Dahmer was real and his victims were
real and the pain their families

355
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.400
suffered still is very much real
so maybe the next time a producer green

356
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.840
lights a movie or streaming series about
a notorious serial killer perhaps they

357
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.100
should refrain from playing armchair
psychologist pretending that their

358
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.480
movies or series can give some new
insight into the killer that hasn't

359
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.340
already been gleamed by criminal
psychiatrists long before now

360
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.600
and instead
focus on the people whose lives they

361
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.840
took

362
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.840
they
are the people we really ought to

363
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.020
remember
