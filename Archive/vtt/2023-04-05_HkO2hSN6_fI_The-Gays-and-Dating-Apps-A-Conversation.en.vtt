00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
hello everyone and welcome to gays
Behaving Badly the show where we talk

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.420
about stuff the Pete booty judge doesn't
want us to talk about my name is James

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.160
I'm Nick so what are we talking about
today today we are talking about dating

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.619
apps dating apps dating apps or as most
gays refer to them hook-up apps yeah uh

5
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.859
because that's not often dates anymore
yeah who does date anymore dating is

6
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.300
dead yeah who dates anymore I mean that
like that said like dating like the old

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.420
style of dating sounds really
intimidating

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.920
and like very obtuse like because like
our hope at this point would be the over

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
30 singles nights like yeah that that's
where like go to the center the the

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.040
singles nights at the synagogue
hopefully find a nice Jewish boyfriend

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.530
no hopefully had a nice Jewish
grandmother

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.640
[Laughter]
to find you a nice Jewish boyfriend

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.960
um I love like but yeah dating sounds
like would be so much easier with

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
Community Values like that in that kind
of very close-knit community and you

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
know like we we always hear stuff
especially from like the Elder gays

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.420
which we would actually love to have
some Elder gays on this show to talk

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.000
about the different things they're gonna
put up you on the show if we call them

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.939
Elder caves well you know like gays like
over 50 over 60 people who people who

19
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.840
were on the dating scene before yeah
before everything went digital yeah and

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.200
you know people who you know kind of for
whom being gay like a big part of the

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.920
being gay identity was going to gay bars
yeah because I think our generation has

22
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.600
really lost that as not just as a dating
thing but as a way to meet people I

23
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.299
don't know how to make gay friends oh
yeah like we were talking about in the

24
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.979
car like how do we just make friends and
yeah I don't know how to make friends do

25
00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.680
you know can you tell me it seems like
the answer might actually be dating apps

26
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.579
some of them yeah and that's that's what
I want to talk about is the changing

27
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.700
space of that yeah and so like that
that's that's something that's like I I

28
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.619
do want to get into with you because not
all dating apps are the same yeah

29
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.679
because not they're finding their niches
yeah like not all apps are bad like with

30
00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.180
the video sponsor lovehoney.com the
world's biggest online sex toy store

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.540
vibrator ring on the market it even has

need to worry about being caught if

38
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.180
I don't know maybe you let someone else
use the app to tease you when they're

39
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.860
not around making going back to work at
the office or even going out to a fancy

40
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.260
dinner so much more fun and exciting
plus it's rechargeable with up to two

41
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.900
hours of play time on a single charge
and it comes with a two year warranty as

42
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.879
a culture we really undervalue the
importance of self-pleasure it's

43
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.720
something we don't talk about even
though it can help people explore and

44
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.920
understand their own bodies which can
lead to a greater understanding of their

45
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.879
sexual desires and preferences
you ever wonder about those stories you

46
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.260
hear of people not figuring out that
they're queer until they're much older

47
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.879
this is why self-pleasure can provide a
safe and healthy outlet for sexual

48
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.840
desires and tension particularly for
people who are not in a sexual

49
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.220
relationship currently or even people
who have no interest in sex with other

50
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.440
people at all either way the bond is
perfect because it certainly helps

51
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.540
increase the user's enjoyment but it is
just as much fun for two people since

52
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.560
it's designed to hit just the right
spots for the receiving partner and you

53
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.000
can receive 20 off of the bond plus any
other amazing products from love Honey

54
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.340
by using my link and discount code in
the description below and having this

55
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.940
thing around would have saved me a lot
of grief

56
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.819
when using apps like Grindr how so
explain that well you know

57
00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.600
Grinders because I I would have been
that person giving out the code to other

58
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.680
people like I I the code to other people
yeah like the app code to other people

59
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.820
so they could control it oh I mean they
are yeah that would have been that that

60
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.560
would have been interesting
um but Grindr for me is like a Time sync

61
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.120
and it always has been because being
someone of the larger body variety uh

62
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.500
it's very rare that I come across and
this is not just Grindr this is

63
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.220
universally it's very rare that I come
across people who find me physically

64
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.040
attractive and then when I do they might
which is you know like I said it's a

65
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.199
Time sync it takes a lot of effort to
find those people then you might end up

66
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.380
with someone who's incredibly pushy or
someone who's incredibly far away this

67
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.400
is like it's been my lot in life I've
had a bit of a glow up since I since we

68
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.820
met actually in my early 20s like I I
didn't really style my hair I didn't

69
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.840
really pay attention to what I put on my
body my body

70
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.440
um and I just was not very you know
interesting you know visually so that

71
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.520
led to a lot of very visually I went to
a lot of people just not being

72
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.639
interested in me
um the Ikea showroom of

73
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.639
homosexuality I guess so I mean like
even more basic than Ikea like I just

74
00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.400
did not give any craps about what I
looked like I don't know there's some

75
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.060
Ikea showrooms that are pretty nice
exactly so

76
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.660
um like that lets me like be having
sexual experiences with people that were

77
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.740
basic but I was basically desperate for
it yeah and so whoever whoever you could

78
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.539
get who whoever you could get in bed and
that led to some not great sexual

79
00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.520
experiences yeah
um that ranged from bad to boring so I I

80
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.919
feel the exact same way like when I was
especially living back I grew up on a

81
00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.979
small island uh in uh on the Atlantic
coast of Canada and there was like

82
00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.780
nobody there the gays that it was it was
the kind of small area where all the gay

83
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.320
people knew each other and all of them
had slept with each other but like so my

84
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.860
experience was very much like okay the
the pool is this big and so my choices

85
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.840
are even smaller yeah because out of
like the five people on grinder one

86
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.979
person might appear every six months who
is at all interested in me you know

87
00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:41.520
physically and so it really became a oh
you're interested what do I have to do

88
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.080
oh my God to keep you remember that
feeling like I I'm sure I ended up

89
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.680
turning off so many guys because I was
so desperate to you know keep them

90
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.440
involved uh that I was just way too
pushed I don't know if I was ever pushy

91
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.880
but I was definitely clingy yeah
um I'm still kind of I'm needy but like

92
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.060
for instance
um when I was in my early 20s it was

93
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.960
just after I had finished Film School
um I found out that a film degree

94
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.819
doesn't provide a lot of employment
activities

95
00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.419
employment opportunities so I had to
move home live with my mom

96
00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.340
um and so you know middle of nowhere
again because I was living in that in a

97
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.259
metropolitan area for film school had to
move home to the middle of nowhere and I

98
00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:30.180
on I think it was manhunt.com or dot net
I think it was.com

99
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.780
um I met someone who basically fit all
of my oh my God he's so attractive

100
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.080
qualities he was Twinkie but had a hairy
chest he was really funny he and like I

101
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.400
really enjoyed talking to him and we
actually talked to each other every

102
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.979
night for about six months
um and then I was like okay I need to

103
00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:57.900
meet him and but the thing was he lived
nine hours away

104
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.460
so I gassed up my car and I did the nine
hour drive which actually took 13

105
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.880
because I got turned around because of
construction and ended up in the middle

106
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.759
of a gigantic rainstorm
um in the dark on a road with no street

107
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.979
lights
um

108
00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:17.880
and so you know I went I spent the
weekend with him did the 13-hour Drive

109
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.780
spent the weekend with him did the nine
hour drive back because I did it in the

110
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.699
daytime this time yeah
um and then I met him one more time for

111
00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:30.840
his birthday bought him a camera and
stuff because he was like I'd uh kind of

112
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.380
playing with the idea of becoming a
photographer I was making all these

113
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.099
plans because you know we were basically
online dating yeah

114
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:42.140
um well we were very much online dating
and so I was making all of these plans

115
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:49.200
and it um blew up in my face because and
I kind of got scared off of you know the

116
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.660
sort of distance dating quite heavily
but like that's just goes to show how

117
00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:00.140
desperate I was for any kind of
attention like oh he's nine hours away

118
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.980
that's fine
I'll make the drive he needs to put in

119
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.000
no effort because it was just that much
desperation yeah and the fact that he

120
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.660
kind of you know hit those kind of check
marks of what I found attractive just

121
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.640
made it even worse because it was like
I gotta get this now or I'm never gonna

122
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.320
this chance is never gonna come up uh I
had an evolution my kind of uh develop

123
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.860
my experiences with online dating I like
I said I wasn't very popular I think it

124
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.540
was because I didn't really know how to
navigate things until later on uh in my

125
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.839
twenties I started my mid-20s was when I
really kind of figure what the rhythm of

126
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:38.459
talking to guys was uh go figure it's
changed now well also you came out quite

127
00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:41.580
late I can't I say late but it might be
the average like I came out when I was

128
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.720
12. you came out and I realized I was
gay when I was 17 like it was out to

129
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.580
everyone by 19. yeah so I started the
online dating thing when I was 13. I had

130
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.360
a boyfriend in Ohio when I was 13. so I
started that very early uh the thing

131
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.140
that was in the days where uh you
couldn't really share pictures easily

132
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.459
online so there wasn't a whole lot of
people telling me to go away because I

133
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.760
was fat because I couldn't see me I
never really even got to that point with

134
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.480
anyone
um I never remember you know you kind of

135
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.800
came of age after that had happened I
guess so yeah but like nobody nobody

136
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:21.180
wanted to date me nobody in spite of the
fact that I re-reach routinely

137
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.339
routinely routinely
routinely talking to guys and be like I

138
00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:28.560
can't like who are far away and like I
can't believe you don't have a boyfriend

139
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.200
like I'd snatch you up I'm like well
you're welcome to if you want to come

140
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.459
here because like local guys in my area
and this is part of the reason not the

141
00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:39.660
reason why that but like I they just
didn't have any interest in me like

142
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.180
either when I was living in New
Brunswick or when I was living in Ottawa

143
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.320
yeah uh my dating experience in Ottawa
because you did live in Ottawa which is

144
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.079
a pretty major city in Canada yeah it's
like

145
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:55.560
it's smaller than DC population wise but
it's also not nice I do not have nice

146
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.800
things to say about the Ottawa dating
scene um I don't know if something

147
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.640
neither do I I don't know if something's
changed since I was been there but the

148
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:09.120
boys there boys were so cold oh God they
were so cold there was an element of

149
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.899
stuck up the kind of profile that I
developed after a while was either they

150
00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:15.899
were closeted and didn't want people to
know about it and so we're just very you

151
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:20.700
know locked down or they wanted their
forever guy and they wanted that forever

152
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.480
guy to hit all of those social media
check boxes like you know looks good

153
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.260
perfect
um because I lived in Ottawa for about a

154
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.220
year and I definitely came up to that
they wanted that Neil Patrick Harris

155
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.300
marriage yes yes that kind of
domestication yeah the perfect Instagram

156
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.380
family yes and that's what I guess I
feel like if you live in Ottawa it's

157
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.920
kind of like living in Washington DC if
you're living there you want to work in

158
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.000
politics or intelligential too yeah yeah
so they wanted that political marriage

159
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.240
image kind of and that really doesn't
didn't drive for me then it doesn't

160
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.279
drive from me now I was told routinely
that you know I was per the Pete Buda

161
00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:00.060
judge dig at the beginning of the show I
was told routinely that you know like

162
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.260
the kind of basic ass
thing that people tell you when they

163
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.220
have someone but you don't is oh you
know just stop looking for it and then

164
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.120
you'll find it it's like I've been
looking for a boyfriend for uh 10 years

165
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.420
at this point yeah
um I realized

166
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.519
uh I didn't really want that kind of
boyfriendy thing uh the sort of

167
00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:24.720
commitment yeah I I liked sort of
meeting people I like being friends I

168
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.660
like sleeping with friends
um

169
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.500
but I never I realized that I didn't
really want that commitment

170
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.440
um I didn't really want that
domestication

171
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.700
um and I felt like I'd been betrayed by
a lot of gay you know propaganda and

172
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.500
thinking that that's what that's what my
objective as a person was yeah

173
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.139
um but the role of I mean we talking
about it though we met online we did I

174
00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:52.200
talked about Manhunt I think it was
Manhunt but yeah like we met on an app

175
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.839
so it is possible to like for apps to be
quite useful in not just like you know

176
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:02.600
getting laid but in you know finding
friends and stuff and but I feel like

177
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.540
the dating apps were different even in
2011 2012 than they are now maybe the

178
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.700
sort of culture of them
like sketchier yeah or sketchy I don't

179
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.600
know whether it's the apps that have
changed or whether I have

180
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.980
I think it's not that the apps
themselves have changed but I think the

181
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.180
expectation of people on them may have
changed maybe because because there's so

182
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.040
many now I feel like there's like a
diaspora going on where people are all

183
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.100
kind of migrating to their own little
areas because we're entering a

184
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.620
generation of uh people on Grindr who
were have never not existed in a time of

185
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.899
dating apps yeah the the day they were
born there were dating apps yeah and not

186
00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:49.740
even dating websites dating apps oh God
that's yeah yeah that's harrowing yeah

187
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.459
whereas like even when it was like when
I came of age and got a grinder like

188
00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:57.360
that was a new thing even if it I wasn't
born into that that grinder was around

189
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.620
for like two years before I was on it I
remember getting grinder the first time

190
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:07.500
I got it on my first iPhone and my
friend and I she was um she was a girl

191
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.420
and we were we drove around trying to
find a close person and then someone

192
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.160
messaged us and we looked at it and it
was like 20 meters away and we freaked

193
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.579
out and drove away because we were like
it was the first time using an app that

194
00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:25.260
had any kind of geolocation to it and it
was like really novel until it was like

195
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.360
oh he can like see us yeah yeah okay so
there was a big long period where I kind

196
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.320
of swore off of online dating for a very
long time uh you were kind of on it

197
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.339
intermittently uh this isn't Halifax but
I was just kind of like I had a few bad

198
00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:44.519
experiences I was just like you know
um and so like when I started I I

199
00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:50.040
started back onto Grindr towards my last
few months in Halifax uh very different

200
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.620
Beast
um I was and I think it was mostly this

201
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.620
was the changes with me like I was more
confident

202
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.579
um I really didn't give much of a crap
if guys blocked me or not yeah uh or got

203
00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:03.839
back to me I was treating it it was a
fun thing I was chatting

204
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:07.560
um but like you know this and this maybe
this is partly dating in your 30s is

205
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.339
having that kind of awareness that like
I don't I don't need this I I I don't

206
00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:14.639
need this I'm here because I want to be
not because I feel like I have to it's

207
00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:18.180
kind of like even though you know I
basically went my entire 20s without

208
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.940
having a boyfriend I had a I had a
boyfriend is a strong word but someone

209
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.399
who I saw in my early 20s we weren't
really compatible in any way but it was

210
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:34.040
kind of like well we're the only two
fish in this Pond

211
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.839
um very different personalities but that
was 22 23

212
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.720
um and ever since then you know I've
been single so I've been single for

213
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.980
about a decade and so I've really kind
of come to this I've lost that

214
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.779
desperation now because I'm like I'm so
used to being single now that it's like

215
00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.440
well I'm not gonna change this for you I
don't know what would what I would like

216
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.500
I think we're talking this on another
one of these it's like what do you do

217
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.860
when you actually get a boyfriend like
how does that work how does dating work

218
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.760
how does initiating that how does saying
like hey are we boyfriends how do you

219
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.079
initiate that conversation yeah like I'm
talking to someone right now who is an

220
00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:14.220
absolute sweetheart and he's like
incredibly nice and friendly and and we

221
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.579
we really click on a lot of things
there's a bit of an age difference but

222
00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:20.760
that seems to bother me more than it
bothers him

223
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.360
um
guys yeah he is younger I can't do it

224
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.000
but like other guys are like no it's
totally okay it's like it's not about

225
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.339
you it's about me it's about me but it's
no it's me I'm baby like kind of

226
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:36.839
wrapping my head around like
how do we do this like if we if we start

227
00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:40.860
seeing each other if we start dating
it's like how does that work like what

228
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.779
labels are put on things well not just
labels but like functionally yeah how do

229
00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:50.399
you like because like when it comes down
to just like doing silly like intimate

230
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.699
little romantic things like you know
cuddling or like you know just hanging

231
00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.660
out staying in like that that's easy
yeah but like when it comes to like okay

232
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.279
we want to go on romantic date how does
that function yeah like do you do the

233
00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:05.520
romantic and I think this is something
that's actually happening with a lot of

234
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.079
gay men and probably probably not just
gay men but like something it's it's

235
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.459
this weird
thing that's happening where there's

236
00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:19.380
kind of two types of gay men now there's
the gay men who have been basically

237
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.640
serial monogamists you know since they
came out they've had boyfriends and so

238
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.900
they are very attuned to relationships
and how relationships should work in the

239
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.460
gay community with with between men and
then there's people like me and you who

240
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.480
have been the opposite serial
um loneliest serious singles yeah

241
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.559
singles and not even like serial
just loneliest

242
00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:47.580
um who are like when the possibility of
a relationship comes up it's like what

243
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.400
the hell do I do here this doesn't make
any sense

244
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.780
um and and that's kind of where I'm at
with it it's like okay he he is I I

245
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.460
appreciate because he's very like
forward with like he is interested in a

246
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.260
relationship and I'm not disinterested
in one but I don't know how to wrap my

247
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.140
head around the idea of what here's a
funny thing I noticed with me kind of

248
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.980
going into this era and the apps have
done this of online dating

249
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.220
um and just talk about this and
answering to talk about the apps is when

250
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.679
it comes to people that I want to have a
close sort of like friendship with I

251
00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:22.020
don't want to just go over to each
other's houses and like watch movies and

252
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.760
play video games and do body stuff uh
body stuff

253
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.299
um like that's fine but at the same time
if I want to Foster these relationships

254
00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:33.840
with people relations with people I
would like to you know go out and do

255
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.460
activities I want to go and do things
um you know go to bars how do you go to

256
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.039
I don't know how to go to bars but I'll
figure I want to figure it out like the

257
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:45.419
other night I was invited to a strip
club by a stripper and I didn't

258
00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:49.559
I I couldn't I couldn't wrap my head
around

259
00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:53.580
the whole the process of leaving the
apartment to drive to the strip club and

260
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.559
going in I am that sheltered at this
point yeah yeah and so like I was kind

261
00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:02.520
of intimidated by okay it's a gay strip
club I'm going to be surrounded by gay

262
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.460
men
I have

263
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.480
I went to a gay bar once right yeah
dating so like with people that I want

264
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.260
an intimate sort of relationship with
relationship with I would like to kind

265
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.039
of go out and do things but I realized
that I when people are like hey come

266
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.980
over I'm like I I don't want to it's
like we can do stuff in the car it's

267
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.880
like I oh God I am too old I like I'm
sorry I I kind of said that to someone

268
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.520
I'm too old for that I'm sorry honestly
I I have been I am not willing to go

269
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:34.799
fellatiate you in your Boiler Room where
there is no flat surface and just raw

270
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.700
concrete on the floor I am not willing
to do that my knees can't take that at

271
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.600
this age well really though I've had
some knee injury I know and so like I

272
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.960
just I I just I I don't want to be
crammed I don't want to kind of have to

273
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.740
stuff myself in somewhere I just don't
want to do car stuff I don't want to do

274
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:55.260
uncomfortable stuff since moving here I
have been Pro and living on my own in a

275
00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.900
city and everything I have been proposed
by pretty attractive guys

276
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.039
to come pick them up and fool around in
the car and I'm like

277
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:11.039
I have an apartment with a bed I I am so
turned off by uncomfortable hookup

278
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:17.640
spaces yeah like I when I I I've um
there was a fellow who uh hello area and

279
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.179
area now that I was talking to on
grinder we just went out like at like 3

280
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:25.500
A.M and walked around town that's all we
did we walked around town we talked it

281
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:31.200
was great
um and like here no and uh the home the

282
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.799
area where I'm living now yeah uh and we
just chatted

283
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:38.100
um and that hasn't happened very often
because he does Nurse stuff and so he

284
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.500
has a really weird schedule but like
thought was nice not the whole there

285
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.640
wasn't any pressure to find a spot to
although outdoor stuff is kind of fun

286
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.600
but like there wasn't
there wasn't any pressure to go to a car

287
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.340
and start doing stuff in a car
um so like yeah I'm more towards that

288
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.679
I'm like I don't want to do with other
stuff

289
00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:02.160
um you can do anything on a bed even if
you need rubber sheets you can still do

290
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.700
it on a bed I like the shape
them

291
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.960
um but yeah that's that's I mean that is
something like the way that it's

292
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.919
expected that you're going to engage in
sexual activities on these hookup apps

293
00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:17.160
now it see that seems to be different
the instantaneousness of it and that's

294
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.340
the thing that is the difference that
I'm seeing from like when I was a

295
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.960
teenager again like you know
long long ago

296
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.140
um to now is that because there was
always expected to be a distance it was

297
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.740
you know we're probably going to talk to
each other for several months before

298
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.539
even the idea of meeting each other is
entertained and so you got to know each

299
00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:42.960
other likely before you even saw
pictures of each other and so there was

300
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.179
the opportunity to get to know someone
before you saw them and so you know per

301
00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:52.740
even if it was like oh
I am very much not physically attracted

302
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.919
to you yeah but we're kind of really
good friends so there was the

303
00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:59.340
opportunity I'm still friends with
people that I eat aided in the early

304
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.360
2000s uh I still talk to them most of
them live in the United States they're

305
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.860
great guys
um there's no no one that I E dated in

306
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.539
the 2000s is someone that I have a bad
yeah connection I'm still talking to

307
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:16.080
someone that I've been talking online
with we talked on Snapchat for like five

308
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.460
years and we're still chatting like one
of the guys I E dated in the 2000s was

309
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.960
ended up coming up and being my prom
date so like there was you know like I

310
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.740
have good relationships with these guys
but now

311
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.900
the the pressure to be instantaneous it
is so hard to develop a connection with

312
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.900
someone yeah
um and I actually did want to talk about

313
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.580
something in the last section but we
didn't have time uh uh or between this

314
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.260
one we we have all the time in the world
we have these self-imposed limits of how

315
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.260
much time we have but um
I noticed what was I gonna say

316
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.620
well yeah we talked about the idea of
like you used to meet up in gay bars and

317
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.400
that yeah yeah and I I I've always
wanted to talk to one of these alleged

318
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.760
aged gays
um

319
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:09.480
Elder guys
um sounds nicer than agent gays uh

320
00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:16.020
trying to get James into playing Elden
ring so uh I would if you'd stop I

321
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.039
had Fair uh

322
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.520
um so
I have this idea of like the way it was

323
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.480
in the old times of being like when
you're at a bar like I feel like online

324
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.200
you're more likely to not talk to
someone or even say something mean to

325
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.380
someone on an online space where you can
even block them the things that have

326
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.520
been said yeah so like you know like
when you're at a bar you can and someone

327
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.880
says like hey how are you you can't
really just well you can but it's it's

328
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.720
it's socially rude you can't really
really just turn around and ignore them

329
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.539
yeah
um you you start up a conversation with

330
00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:52.080
them you kind of chat with them because
if you are rude to someone in public

331
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.679
that's a mark on you other people see
that other people notice that and I

332
00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:01.260
think that's how like you got gay friend
groups maybe that didn't all look like

333
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.860
the same so like maybe if because now
you see these gay friend groups on

334
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.059
Instagram and it's like wait which one
is Paul because they all look like Paul

335
00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:12.539
and like maybe and like the way I kind
of I don't know the way I kind of look

336
00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:16.740
at it is like you know like you would be
willing to give that you know if you're

337
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.760
if your ideal is like a nine or a ten
you'd be willing to give that six a try

338
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.000
if if he's got a good personality as
they say personality makes up for a lot

339
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.240
in a way that you wouldn't on online
dating because it's like you you I don't

340
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.860
like the way you look block yeah
um or as many people on Grindr have just

341
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.620
replied to me fat just fat like that
that that's for like a long time what I

342
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.580
want to know is whether that is me with
rose tinted glasses and that or was that

343
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.720
actually that's why I want to like have
a a you know an elder gay an older gay

344
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:52.140
person on here who you know grew up with
the gay Birds who could maybe say like

345
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.580
no it's it's not nearly as you know
because I have heard or from some people

346
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.000
that it was better than it is now and
that we really lost something by the

347
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.100
presence of online dating the community
I'm not really sure I I wouldn't be

348
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.400
willing to hear that until I hear
specific instances from real life people

349
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.020
like first-hand accounts
um so if you're watching if you're you

350
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.340
know an elder gay
um who lives in the GTA and don't mind

351
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.179
being called an elder gay
um you know shoot me a message on

352
00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:24.360
Twitter Twitter if Twitter still exists
at this point

353
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.700
um or Instagram or wherever or YouTube
or comment below maybe we can you know

354
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.600
set something up where we can actually
talk to someone we want to do interviews

355
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.320
on this show eventually because
um but we are right now not talking

356
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.980
about the dating community that was we
were talking about the community that is

357
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.760
and that is developing I think we'll
we'll take a break and we'll jump into

358
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.820
that the next uh we'll jump into the
next section so we'll take a quick break

359
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:53.159
and we will be right back with more okay
so

360
00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:56.400
um
it's it's been particularly interesting

361
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:03.299
with me since the the YouTube channel
has taken off yeah uh not a first but uh

362
00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:07.320
especially since I've moved here where
there is a much bigger gay scene than

363
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.960
there was where there's a lot of people
who know who I am which

364
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.580
I would like living on the East Coast
nobody knew who I was

365
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.700
um and so you know I just assumed well
most a lot of people don't watch my

366
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.840
channel but now living in a place where
there are a lot of gay people

367
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.320
um I've
they come across me and they message me

368
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.500
they say very nice things the pharmacist
who gave you your third covet booster

369
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.520
recognized you fourth covered booster
but yes

370
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.520
um
and

371
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:45.299
um so like kind of gauging because
sometimes I get sometimes people message

372
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:51.059
me and they are very
starfuckery which I do not qualify

373
00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:56.760
myself as a star in ad by any story I
kind of like will be on the Discord and

374
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.059
say like I'm an influencer and always
have like the Sparkles beside it because

375
00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:03.000
like I don't I just don't think it's
because I have the technical

376
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.059
qualifications of being an influencer
because I have a thousand followers on

377
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:09.779
Twitter
um and that's kind of like industry

378
00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:15.360
networking HR PR kind of stuff yeah but
like I don't really qualify myself as

379
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.400
someone who is capable of influencing
anyone oh neither do I like I I I like I

380
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.600
do through the proxy of you because like
you know our videos have reached people

381
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.140
oh I know but even like you know the
killing stalking video has two million

382
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.740
views some of the videos have close to a
million views most of the videos go to

383
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.179
at least like a quarter of a million
views it's you know but like I don't

384
00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:44.760
consider myself like big time anything
um but yeah back to where I was so like

385
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.440
I get messages from these people who
know who I am and

386
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.820
sometimes they're they're always very
nice about it they're always very

387
00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:00.260
laudatory very friendly
um but sometimes they're very forward

388
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.200
and it comes off as very starfuckery
yeah

389
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.039
um and I and so it's kind of like this
weird thing now where I'm like okay

390
00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:11.760
you're being really friendly to me are
you being friendly to me because you

391
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.840
like me or are you being friendly to me
because you feel like

392
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.380
it's a notch kind of thing like the guys
who go around to sleep with all the drag

393
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.100
queens
oh yeah yeah uh they'll sleep with all

394
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.720
the drag queens and I like everyone they
like have like a tiered list and like a

395
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.320
whole thing really like like sort into
like the ABC no no no no no just like

396
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.919
who's I don't know how it works oh I'd
love to see that but later and so a lot

397
00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:37.919
of like drag queens watch out for that
because there are people who are just

398
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:41.460
like I just want to have sex with you
because you are you know you are a Katya

399
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.440
you are
um Aquaria and you know that's kind of

400
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.440
dehumanizing a bit unless you're just
horny and you want to get it yeah then

401
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.860
you get it
um but like I kind of I'm like I

402
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.220
certainly you want to hang out it's
certainly like a weird Power Trip I I

403
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.960
don't know yeah like when I put out the
casting calls for Telos for instance

404
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.860
um there were people who were like oh my
God I know what Telos is I watch your

405
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.679
YouTube channel and offering sex in
exchange for a casting session and I'm

406
00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:17.279
like we're auditioning everybody
um honestly sex is less likely to get

407
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:21.480
you cast because
um morals and ethics well yeah like

408
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.080
honestly I'd be willing to discount
anyone who would kind of include a offer

409
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.440
of sexual facilitation yeah and I mean
these are people who they'll they'll

410
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.039
message me on like Twitter or Instagram
yeah after sending in an application I'm

411
00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:35.840
like your application

412
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.520
let's grow that's crazy it is and it's
it's so it's it's this weird it's this

413
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.659
weird area I'm in like the guy I am
talking to has never watched a video on

414
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:50.340
the channel he thinks it's really cool
he thinks it's amazing that you know I

415
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.700
have you know almost 300 000 subscribers
and everything he thinks that's awesome

416
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.899
he's ever watched one yeah and I'm like
so he's like me

417
00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:01.580
this one never watches the videos

418
00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:06.000
I could change everything I could say
anything in these videos and well like

419
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.799
with you while you're recording them so
not always right I make a lot of videos

420
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:14.880
when you're not here
um so what is it like then kind of

421
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.100
with on the dating apps and stuff from
the sort of asexual well first of all

422
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.620
when I was younger because with me it's
a very easy just white gay man dating so

423
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.720
when I was younger I neither knew that I
was non-binary or asexual although it's

424
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.960
one of those things like looking back I
can absolutely see how I was both of

425
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.200
those things and just had no idea how to
express that or didn't have the language

426
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.799
to sort of describe that
um I was always really touch and go

427
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:44.100
about sex
which is part of the reason why I kind

428
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.620
of I probably got a reputation as a
flake

429
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.659
um because I would sometimes flake out
of meetings because I was like we

430
00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:58.320
planned this but I that the hour is not
and I just have no interest yeah

431
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.120
um
if if you weren't 100 in the mood yeah

432
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.840
for it it was a no-go yeah and since
then I kind of really have expanded and

433
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.580
explored kind of the way that I look at
sex and it is very much in a sort of

434
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:17.159
proxy contact context like I want to
experience it uh I want to explore it

435
00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:20.760
but the only way to explore it is to
really experience it and experiencing it

436
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.260
isn't what I'm after
um it's the you know more psychological

437
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:30.480
expert the idea yeah and you can't and
I would love to do that by having

438
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.080
you know a threesome with people where I
could just be on the side and sort of

439
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.860
you know observing but like that's not
typically normal I need to get you a VR

440
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.440
headset
the other porn exists

441
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.399
so and that's kind of why I kind of lean
much more towards pornography and

442
00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:52.620
especially illustration because I I find
that these people explore those ideas in

443
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.039
more kind of explicit ways rather than
kind of having to sort of Express to a

444
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:59.460
perfect stranger the ways that you kind
of fetishize certain things that's

445
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.059
something else sort of very sorry to
interrupt uh another thing I want to

446
00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:08.520
throw out there if you're in the GTA and
you are an artist who does NSFW art we'd

447
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.159
love to have you on to talk about that
oh yeah yeah

448
00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:14.820
uh sorry about that continue yeah and I
don't mean like franchise personalities

449
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.840
or bodies or things but like sort of
ideas of Mass fetishized Ideas of

450
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.620
masculinity it's very cerebral and it
takes a lot for me to be comfortable

451
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.059
expressing that with someone who I am in
this kind of porch

452
00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:31.260
maybe I don't know what the word
um

453
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.960
regardless uh I I am nervous about kind
of approaching those things yeah

454
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.480
um which is understandable yeah and
which leads me to now when I do know how

455
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.260
to kind of advocate for myself in
indirect ways uh for both being

456
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.380
non-binary and the things for the amount
of guys on grinder that will just

457
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.120
default to calling you dude or bro or
pan and it's like I'm non-binary in my

458
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.600
profile

459
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.059
um
and the ways that guys are just obsessed

460
00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:05.159
with labels up obsessed with labels like
I have it in my profile that I'm a side

461
00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:09.240
because it's it's true I don't typically
like penetration yeah anal penetration

462
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.539
specifically
um but you know if I do engage in sexual

463
00:33:12.539 --> 00:33:16.679
activities it you know there are other
things to be done and so guys kind of

464
00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:19.380
take this as like never ever in a
million years would I ever stick

465
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.559
anything in my butt
um and they have questions about that

466
00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:28.500
they qualify me on that Soul principle
at like incredibly

467
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.140
um
which which I'm bothered by because it's

468
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.100
like I I put that there because like I
don't want to set expectations but

469
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.120
expectation seems to be the language of
modern gay dating

470
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:45.960
absolutely like I think
now there's no going into a dating idea

471
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.419
or even a hookup idea any kind of any
kind of gay connecting

472
00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:55.019
um
that doesn't already have an expectation

473
00:33:55.019 --> 00:34:02.159
on it there there is no just like
let's get together walk around a mall

474
00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:07.559
and you know or go to dinner or whatever
and if things are vibing let's go home

475
00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:12.060
and see what happens if things are
vibing vibing

476
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.800
um
the we-vi bond

477
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.220
um
but it's it's very much like a

478
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.540
participle through
love honey Link in the description

479
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.839
discount code too uh I looked on the
site they actually got some fun stuff

480
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:32.399
they've got a lot of stuff on there uh
check it out this is the person this is

481
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:37.800
this personal recommendation
um but yeah it's like you know there's

482
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.119
no expectation of maybe getting to know
someone even a little bit even just for

483
00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:45.780
like an hour or two and then see what
happens it's like okay

484
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:51.060
here's the Box this is what I want
um do your sexual proclivities fit in

485
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.700
this box no never mind and and there's
no openness very refreshing when you do

486
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.359
get someone that isn't like that and
absolutely and in recent time I actually

487
00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:04.260
have like there's a guy in the area
where I am he's like an hour and a half

488
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.980
away so it's uncommon that we have
gotten to meet up but like hour halfway

489
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.900
is the area I get told no because of a
20-minute drive because like um and

490
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.740
we've met up a few times uh we the way
when we started talking it was very much

491
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.920
like I was kind of like I'm not
interested in anything like we were just

492
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.640
chatting and it was fun because it was
we were being flirty and stuff yeah and

493
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.740
like after a while it kind of got to the
point where like okay we need to meet up

494
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.400
and it was like but it was after a
period of time where you had gotten yeah

495
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.599
exactly and that's that's something that
like even even back in the the olden

496
00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:42.119
days with the small town and stuff there
were a couple of guys who I would talk

497
00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:48.000
to and it would be in a very
prolonged way because like they would

498
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.359
only be available at like two in the
morning they couldn't drive I couldn't

499
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:56.400
drive between 12 and 6 because that was
a law and everything and so it just

500
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.720
couldn't happen but we still talked yeah
and then when I got my ability to drive

501
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.800
between 12 and six it was like well
let's see and then you know we saw and

502
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.339
you know I don't talk to them anymore so
you know what happened but

503
00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:16.079
but yeah you know being able to get to
know someone even even

504
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:22.740
like I said even as much as like walking
around a mall or you know getting coffee

505
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.900
or something just I feel like and maybe
this is the old man in me but going from

506
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:33.900
zero to 60 from closing grinder and then
going whoop into someone's bed is like

507
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.760
I'm noticing that that kind of like meet
up like go to the mall because remember

508
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.339
I was here and I saw a friend of mine
that I've been talking to for a little

509
00:36:41.339 --> 00:36:44.460
bit we went to the mall for like a whole
day and yeah we just talked it walked

510
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.359
around talked bought some stuff
um and that was nice I'm noticing that

511
00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:55.740
happens a lot with Kai's my age in a few
years older of anyone who is more than a

512
00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.660
few years older is instant like we need
to meet and do sexual things

513
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.500
um like many years older than you yeah
and anyone not anyone who's like 10 more

514
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.520
than 10 years older than me is like we
need to meet okay yeah and anyone who's

515
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.560
younger than me is like Senpai notice me
so

516
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.359
um and like they're pushy about it
they're very pushy about it I've had

517
00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:22.500
since since I've come back to Grindr
I've had some really not uncomfortable

518
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.700
but just like I it felt like I had to
break up with these people because like

519
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.480
oh yeah
even though you might have never met we

520
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.560
one of them I met once for like a few
minutes because I was I was tired yeah

521
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.520
another one like I just had to throw in
the towel because I'm like I have a

522
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.579
really busy schedule when I'm here in
Toronto I'm sorry I can't really take

523
00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:45.960
any time to step away but in in part
because like I value my own kind of

524
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.500
downtime because I need a lot of
downtime yeah and we do a lot of work

525
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:55.079
when I'm here yeah so I like I like it
would be nice and like they act like I

526
00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:58.560
was misleading them even though I was
like if I'm always say if I have time if

527
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.260
I have time if I have time
um but it just got to a point where I

528
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.980
was like I don't know if I'm ever gonna
have time when these guys are putting a

529
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.700
lot of emotional investment in me for
some reason yeah and it's like every

530
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.820
time they saw that I was here on Grindr
they'd be like oh so you're good to hang

531
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.079
out now I'm like
uh well yeah because I think the

532
00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:20.339
expectation is if you've got the app
open you have downtown yeah and I think

533
00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:24.420
that that's a really toxic expectation
like I think when you're going on to

534
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.560
these data apps with expectations you're
gonna get let down

535
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.180
um but the difference unless you're like
gorgeous and you're aiming for gorgeous

536
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.900
and find other gorgeous I guess so but
even then like

537
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.200
um because they seem to do fine you know
even gorgeous guys get flaked out on

538
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.960
I've heard it from like super attractive
people have a hard time getting laid

539
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:49.800
because everyone's intimidated by them
yeah I avoid them because like like I I

540
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.640
and that's sort of like that pushiness
that sort of like if I own your time

541
00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.619
I've been really effective on it's
happened to me a couple of times where I

542
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:06.599
might be you know doing something I
might be shooting a video about to shoot

543
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:09.660
a video or something Grinders just open
on my phone from earlier in the day or

544
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.480
whatever yeah and someone will message
me and I'll be like Oh I'm actually

545
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.640
really busy right now but you know maybe
we can chat later blocked

546
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:24.359
yeah there's no room yeah it's like
anything except the exact you you do

547
00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:27.180
talk to someone a little bit kind of
feel them out how to have some witty

548
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.359
conversation
um maybe it's a little bit one-sided

549
00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:35.700
maybe it's kind of fine but like after
that it's like some people expect that

550
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:41.339
that means you're going to be like good
friends or that you're going to go past

551
00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:45.780
presence is quite of or go past go
further than that like there's that

552
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.440
expectation that like oh we hit it off
Ergo I can start planning for this

553
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.880
person to be in my life and it's like
please settle back a little bit we

554
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.079
literally just met yeah
um and like I I kind of I'm in

555
00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:01.260
comfortable with that level of intensity
just like yeah

556
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.560
um especially if you have not met in
person in a meaningful way especially

557
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.320
yeah
um because I

558
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.240
I do tend to go a little bit boy crazy
sometimes but like I I manage it I I

559
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.680
recognize that that's something about me
and that nobody owes me anything for how

560
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.720
I feel right um and it's that sense that
people that these guys that I mentioned

561
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.980
it seems like they act like I owe them
something and I I don't know what to do

562
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.220
with that yeah and that's part of the
reason why I just have not been opening

563
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.420
up Grindr yeah
but you know what doesn't

564
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.040
come at you with any expectations

565
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:43.440
the We Vibe I knew it
laughs

566
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.960
uh seriously though seriously but you've
been talking telling me recently before

567
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.339
we signed off about some other newer
kinds of dating apps that aren't grinder

568
00:40:53.339 --> 00:40:57.359
or scruff well I mean the only other
dating app that I've been using is hinge

569
00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:00.839
hinge and you told me about Tinder you
said that Tinder is a lot more Tinder

570
00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:05.540
wasn't bad but Tinder did have a lot of
like instantaneous expectations

571
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.660
when you were on it you told me that
there were more relatively more people

572
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.140
who were looking for like you know
friendship and relationships yeah but

573
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.560
there were just as many people kind of
okay on the grinder headset headset

574
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.260
mindset mindset uh mindset headspace
um but yeah I've been using hinge which

575
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:28.280
is an app that's not dislike uh Tinder
it's a it's it's sort of a matching app

576
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.859
uh you know you go on you create your
profile you can go into pretty good

577
00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:35.760
detail like you can say like if you
drink if you do

578
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.020
um drugs or anything like that like if
you're open to stuff like that

579
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.460
um like you can go in like
like do you want kids do you not want

580
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.000
kids do you want a relationship do you
just want friends like you can go into

581
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.740
really specific detail in there and then
you know if you like someone you scroll

582
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:59.099
through and you like their profile and
if they like they they see that you have

583
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:02.640
liked them they can look at your profile
and if they like you then they can match

584
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.839
you can talk to each other if not so
yeah it's very very tender but it's the

585
00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:10.500
atmosphere you've been telling me about
of that app is very geared away from

586
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.160
instant hookups yeah like I I have
talked to quite a few people on there

587
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.400
now
um I haven't come across any Duds on

588
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.619
there and like they they're all nice
which whether it's relationship stuff or

589
00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:27.420
just friend stuff they're nice uh and I
think you know maybe this is just I've

590
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.220
been lucky maybe it's different
experience for other people but for me

591
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:37.020
it's been really positive because I'm
kind of seeing okay there are guys out

592
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:42.119
there who are open to getting to know
someone who are open to being friends

593
00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:47.700
who who are open to more than just dick
and

594
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.680
in a surprising amount of cases they are
shockingly good luck

595
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.700
for me that's a big change of pace but
this is something that I I should have

596
00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.540
seen coming because like the
disenfringement of date of Fast dating

597
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.940
like online dating has been growing for
quite some time it's like fast food

598
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.819
I should have expected that there would
be like a large section of people who

599
00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:11.880
are just kind of sick of it yeah they
want to kind of move on Pat they don't

600
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.780
really want the grinder thing because
they don't like that kind of culture uh

601
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.200
but at the same time something but at
the same time we live in a culture that

602
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.980
has systematically disenfranchised
personal meetings we live in a society

603
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.839
yeah so we especially after covet gay
bars up and shutting down a lot of them

604
00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:31.859
are back now I think covet may have
actually influenced a lot of people to

605
00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:35.760
be more open to just talking for a bit
yeah yeah and so I don't think it should

606
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.440
be surprising that we do have uh maybe a
growing number of dating apps that are

607
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:47.400
geared away from hookups and even away
from dating and more towards the idea of

608
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.960
um you know more kind of sustainable
friendships yeah because like for a hint

609
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.560
this is obviously it's not a this isn't
an ad for hinge this is an ad for the We

610
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.920
Vibe Bond we've been saying indeed the
word dating so long I hope the algorithm

611
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.500
picked it up and gives us an ad for
Christian Mingle I love when we get

612
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.540
those
um but the the thing with hinge that I

613
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:11.579
is that even in your profile there are
things that it's not just asking for

614
00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:15.300
pictures it wants your opinion on things
it says like

615
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.579
um they're like text prompts that are
like talk about

616
00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:23.520
um the craziest thing that's ever
happened to you on vacation stuff like

617
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.119
that so people can kind of get an idea
of your personality instead of just

618
00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:33.839
pictures and so I've found that to be
very heartening yeah because I feel like

619
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:38.040
okay these people exist where maybe I
can get a gay friend group together and

620
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.520
we can you know have a giant Katan tape
because like we were talking about it

621
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.359
and on we were on our way to get some
stuff for the video shoot that's coming

622
00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:50.339
up yeah and we're going to do in about
five minutes I was I was complaining and

623
00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:54.180
kind of sort of whining about like all I
really want from all of this is kind of

624
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.960
like a friend group with a gay friend
group an exclusively queer friend group

625
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.079
with artistic sensibilities yeah
um I don't even care if they're artistic

626
00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:04.980
I just want them to do I I'm learning I
need people like that in my life because

627
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.640
my friends in the area right now are not
artistically minded and it's really

628
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.940
starting to
I keep telling you to move I know it's

629
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.640
happening soon I keep telling you it's
happening

630
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.540
um because I really like about just like
talking with you I'll be like Luca likes

631
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.160
this thing yeah because I talk about him
like he's a real person Luke is the main

632
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.920
character of my book series and I'm
publishing by the way

633
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.819
um because he just whispered that Luca
is the main character of Nick's book

634
00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:32.700
series that he's publishing called
Avalon night the first book is called
