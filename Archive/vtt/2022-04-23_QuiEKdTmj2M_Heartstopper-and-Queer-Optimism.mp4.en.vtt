4
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.680
So I’ve been reading a lot of queer YA books
over the last few years.

5
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.550
I didn’t know the genre even existed until
the movie Love, Simon came out.

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
I ordered the book its based on, Simon and
the Homo Sapian Agenda, from Amazon and then

7
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
suddenly my suggested feed was filled with
gay YA from authors like Rainbow Rowel, Alex

8
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.989
London, Shaun David Hutchinson, and Caleb
Roehrig.

9
00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.039
So, I started plowing through this small library
of queer YA books, diving ever deeper into

10
00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.410
a world where amazingly complex thriller-type
plots happened in the lives of gay teenagers.

11
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.769
Ah, what an uneventful life I had led.

12
00:00:58.769 --> 00:00:59.870
Of course there were plenty more…

13
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.420
“slice of life” books about queer teens
discovering themselves and going on to have

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
these *perfect* little relationships and these
*perfect* little lives.

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.080
Which I’ve become unable to read lately
because my brain just can't process that amount

16
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.220
of fantasy anymore.

17
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540
Witches, warlocks, and magic rings are one
thing.

18
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.200
But perfectly happy queer people?

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.050
My suspension of disbelief can only go so
far.

20
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.370
And while becoming an expert on gay YA, Amazon
continually recommended I read Heartstopper

21
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.090
by Alice Oseman.

22
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.590
But I couldn’t bring myself to order it
because I just had no interest in reading

23
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.600
graphic novels that weren’t about superheroes.

24
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.240
I have nothing against comic books, I have
a shelf filled with thousands of dollars worththem,

25
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.240
but I just didn’t see how anything but superheroes,
and maybe the odd Saga, could work as a comic

26
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240
book.

27
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.640
And then I discovered manga.

28
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.160
And so thanks to the black and white art of
No. 6, Demon Slayer, and Attack on Titan,

29
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.520
my appetite for comics not trying to look
like Jim Lee drew them began to grow.

30
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.780
And then I saw the trailer for the Netflix
adaptation of Heartstopper and gave in.

31
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.220
I went to my local bookstore and bought the
three volumes they had in stock.

32
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.659
Unbeknownst to me that a Volume 4 exists,
which I couldn't find anywhere but stumbled

33
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.129
across at Toys R’ Us of all places.

34
00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.129
So what is Heartstopper?

35
00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.440
It’s a comic book, originally published
as a web toon, about two queer teenagers,

36
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.790
Charlie and Nick, who find themselves falling
in love with each other despite Nick being

37
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.069
presumed straight by everyone in their school.

38
00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.469
He’s bisexual, by the way.

39
00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.280
Dorky Charlie gets to date rugby-playing Nick…
which is beyond a gay wish fulfillment fantasy…

40
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.139
but I couldn’t stop reading it because it
was just so damn cute and innocent.

41
00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.459
Spoilers ahead, by the way.

42
00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.670
Like I said, I’ve read a lot of gay YA.

43
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.879
But plenty of those books dealt heavily with
homophobia, conversion therapy, violence,

44
00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.540
and even murder.

45
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.069
Like most of the books I read.

46
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.760
So I was honestly caught off guard by the
simple purity of Heartstopper.

47
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.060
It’s a testament to Oseman’s writing that
they managed to make a story as innocent as

48
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.129
this, and yet completely un-put-down-able.

49
00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.760
I think a big part of it, as least for me,
is that the characters aren’t obsessed with

50
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.200
jumping into bed together as soon as they
start dating.

51
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.239
A lot of queer YA features some very horny
protagonists, which is fine, but I never got

52
00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.840
laid as a teenager so it just comes across
as forced, at least to me.

53
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.470
While Charlie and Nick get their kicks from
just hugging and kissing each other.

54
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.620
This may come from Oseman being aromantic
and asexual, and so they’re not trying to

55
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.290
make up for their lost years as a horny teenager
who missed out on all the sex that we’d

56
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.510
been promised by shows like Gossip Girl and
90210.

57
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.930
Do people even know what 90210 is anymore?

58
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.310
But the story isn’t completely void of tension.

59
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.900
Our main characters do deal with real life
problems that do effect plenty of people in

60
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.409
the real queer community.

61
00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.279
Homophobia, fear of coming out, being unsure
of their sexuality, and even eating disorders.

62
00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.999
The main character, Charlie, has developed
anorexia over the last couple of years because,

63
00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.510
while his life seemed to spin out of control
after being outed, how much he ate seemed

64
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.469
like the one thing that he could fully control.

65
00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.889
Which spiraled into unhealthy eating habits,
and then barely eating at all.

66
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.709
And while, in Charlie’s case, the eating
disorder grew out of a need for a sense of

67
00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.200
control, in real life eating disorders run
rampant in the gay male community.

68
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.079
Since all of our role models tend to be actors
and singers brave enough to come out, we tend

69
00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.790
to idolize people who also have personal trainers,
dieticians, and talented airbrush artists

70
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.230
who can make them look their best whenever
they’re shirtless.

71
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.620
And who starve and dehydrate themselves for
days before a photoshoot to make sure they

72
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.770
look as ripped as possible.

73
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.600
It’s an ever-growing problem in the queer
community, especially for queer men, that

74
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.150
I’m probably going to make a video about
at some point because I absolutely have body

75
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.150
image problems.

76
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.890
One of my favorite things about Heartstopper
(the graphic novel) was that at one point

77
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.540
our main duo go to the beach with friends
and Nick, the rugby playing heart throb, is

78
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.840
drawn to have a little bit of a belly.

79
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.570
Or at least isn’t shredded like he walked
out of an episode of Riverdale.

80
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.060
That’s when I realized that, though the
author isn’t a gay man themself, they get

81
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060
it.

82
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.140
Meaning they understood some of the most prominent
issues boiling up in the gay male community

83
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.150
besides coming out and homophobia.

84
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.260
That, even for queer teenagers, there are
a lot more issues they need to deal with.

85
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.290
Hell, even for queer adults.

86
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.000
Something else that popped up during the course
of the initial four volumes was that you never

87
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.510
really get to stop coming out.

88
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.080
Once Nick has realized he’s bisexual, he
has to come out multiple times for multiple

89
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080
people.

90
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.510
Friends, family, acquaintances, teachers.

91
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.400
Which is something a lot of queer media doesn’t
really deal with.

92
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.560
We don’t come out once, have a big revelatory
moment of “I’m queer!”

93
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.340
And then it’s over and done with.

94
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.810
We come out over and over again throughout
our lives, and it doesn’t really get easier

95
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.010
as you get older.

96
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.360
Sure the big stresses of coming out to your
friends and family can be taken care of when

97
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.180
you’re relatively young.

98
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.420
But every time you make a new friend, get
a new job, the coming out process happens

99
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.420
all over again.

100
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.880
And the anxiety of “How will this person
react” continually rears its ugly head.

101
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.250
Luckily in Heartstopper, pretty much every
coming out situation that we see is a relatively

102
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.340
positive one, since we’re only really seeing
Nick come out.

103
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.500
(Though his big brother is a bit of a dick.)

104
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.500
But throughout we’re not given the impression
that coming out is all candy and roses for

105
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500
everyone.

106
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.710
Charlie’s coming out was rough.

107
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.610
He was accidentally outed by a friend instead
of making the decision for himself, and the

108
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.440
resulting bullying has left him with no small
amount of trauma associated with it.

109
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.360
Even going so far as to hurt himself.

110
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.150
And again, Heartstopper manages to remain
sweet, while dealing with topics like self

111
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.200
harm, because it was, for the most part, in
the past.

112
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.110
We meet Charlie after things have gotten better
for him, though the scars, both mentally and

113
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.470
physically, still remain.

114
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.080
So Oseman is able to acknowledge these traumatic
parts of coming out… the bullying, the homophobia…

115
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.540
without the sweet love story of these two
boys becoming bogged down with it.

116
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.330
Though, even in the current timeline of the
story, it doesn’t entirely back away from

117
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.360
dealing with more serious issues.

118
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.760
Once Charlie’s eating disorder has been
discovered by Nick, he carefully attempts

119
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.480
to help Charlie deal with it, but quickly
realizes that he’s out of his depth when

120
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.680
it comes to this kind of mental health situation.

121
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.480
Charlie doesn’t want to talk to his parents
about it because he’s convinced that they’ll

122
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960
think he’s just looking for attention but,
with Nick’s help, does eventually talk to

123
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.840
them and gets the help that he needs.

124
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.260
It’s not easy though.

125
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.870
He actually enters a mental health institution
once it's discovered that his anorexia has

126
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.040
gotten so bad that he’s begun fainting.

127
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.210
But we don’t dwell on this negativity.

128
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.010
That’s not what Heartstopper is.

129
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.990
Oseman isn’t writing a story about trauma,
but a story about doing your best to live

130
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.820
your life despite the trauma.

131
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.120
Saying, yes, these things exist.

132
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.580
Homophobia, eating disorders, mental health
issues — they exist — and they need to

133
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.580
be dealt with.

134
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.220
But they don’t drag the reader through hell
to establish this.

135
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.710
And yet, it’s not sugar coated either: Charlie
doesn’t finish his stint in the hospital

136
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.300
and then suddenly his eating disorder is taken
care of.

137
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.960
It’s an active part of the story going forward,
but not THE story going forward.

138
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.310
Something else I was surprised by was that
Charlie’s whole story doesn’t revolve

139
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.280
around Nick, as exemplified by his mental
health issues.

140
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.400
He’s also dealing with a strained relationship
with his parents, especially his mother.

141
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.860
And Nick’s story doesn’t revolve around
Charlie.

142
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.950
Nick is also dealing with the slow progression
of his own friend group becoming more accepting.

143
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.361
He’s dealing with a father who lives in
another country and doesn’t make much of

144
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:12.050
an effort to connect with his son.

145
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.450
He’s dealing with a dickhead of an older
brother.

146
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.100
And both boys are dealing with school work
and grades.

147
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.760
Heartstopper really started to remind me of
an ongoing British television drama.

148
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.920
Something that lasts for years where you can
follow the characters across many story arcs,

149
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.190
character progressions, and milestones in
life.

150
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.180
Instead of just being about a secluded period
of time where “the story” takes place.

151
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.300
Which is something you can actually do with
ongoing media like comics or television.

152
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.570
Forms of media that can focus more on character
than anything else.

153
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.000
Where as movies and novels, for the most part,
are focused on plots.

154
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.550
Act structure: beginnings, middles, and ends.

155
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.560
But comics give you more leeway.

156
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.730
They also allow you to explore character aside
from the main pair.

157
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.650
Heartstopper has a broad cast of characters
including friends, siblings, parents, and

158
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.650
teachers.

159
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.400
And a lot of them, to my delight, were also
queer.

160
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.130
Tara and Darcy are a lesbian couple, and friends
with Charlie and Nick.

161
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.170
They start out as a safe space - Characters
with whom Charlie and Nick can admit to being

162
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.590
a couple while Nick figures out exactly how
he’s supposed to come out.

163
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.570
But as the story progresses we get to learn
more about the pair.

164
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.830
Tara is smart, emotionally solid, and comes
from a loving home.

165
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.990
While Darcy is chaotic and fun, but comes
from a bad home life, where her parents verbally

166
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.950
abuse her because of her sexuality and personality.

167
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.060
There’s also Elle, a trans girl who used
to go to the same school as Charlie and Nick

168
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.870
before transitioning and transferring to an
all girls school.

169
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.570
For the most part she’s portrayed as an
upbeat, happy character, but through dialogue

170
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.160
we do find out that she was mercilessly bullied
after transitioning, and isn’t even able

171
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.060
to visit her close relatives in Egypt because
of the country’s laws regarding trans people.

172
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.350
And then there’s Ben, an asshole who used
Charlie to get his gay kicks while being unwilling

173
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.520
to come out of the closet himself.

174
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.740
Emotionally abusive, toxic, and entirely full
of himself, Ben is as close to a persistent

175
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.240
antagonist as you get in Heartstopper.

176
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.230
Even Harry, who initially bullies Nick and
especially Charlie, comes around.

177
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.810
But Ben just keeps on being a dick.

178
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.000
Ben actually shows up in other works that
Alice Oseman has written as well.

179
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.050
You see, Oseman has created their own universe
of sorts, with multiple comics, novels, novellas,

180
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.089
and short stories all taking place in the
same world about different characters.

181
00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:26.330
Such as Solitaire, Radio Silence, I Was Born
for This, and This Winter.

182
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.380
Aspects from each work overlap into the others,
but never take over the story.

183
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.080
This kind of reminds of me the many prime
time soap spin offs of the 1980s, with characters

184
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.220
from Dallas sometimes popping up on Knotts
Landing, and characters from Dynasty finding

185
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.260
their way into The Colby’s.

186
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.750
I thought the 90210 reference was dated.

187
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.830
Oseman is creating a sort of Marvel Cinematic
Universe for queer British youth.

188
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.070
Anyway, all of this is to say that this weekend,
on April 22 in the year 2022 to be exact,

189
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.839
Netflix released the Heartstopper streaming
series.

190
00:10:56.839 --> 00:11:01.460
Starring age-appropriate actors Joe Locke
and Kit Conner as Charlie and Nick respectively.

191
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.870
And trans actress Yasmin Finney as Elle.

192
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.360
And the adorable sweetness of the comics has
transferred perfectly over to the screen.

193
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.029
And this series, in my opinion, came at the
absolute perfect time.

194
00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:16.870
Because the bigots aren't even trying to hide
their hate anymore.

195
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.600
They’re coming back out of their closets.

196
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.550
As, I’m sure, you’re very well aware,
several states across America have currently

197
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.030
gotten into a ‘mood’ and have decided
they’d like to go back to the 1970s (please

198
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.710
and thank-you) and stop people from acknowledging
the existence of queer people around, basically,

199
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.210
anyone under the age of consent.

200
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.660
And even then they’d like us to keep our
queer mouths shut as much as possible.

201
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.430
On a similar keel, the UK is also engaging
in heated discussions about trans rights,

202
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.790
investing a great deal of political power
in exempting trans identities from bills designed

203
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.490
to protect other queer people.

204
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.880
Why?

205
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.050
Because we’re apparently unsafe to have
around children.

206
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.010
The more backward thinking people even think
that we groom kids.

207
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.660
That by allowing media to exist in a youth-friendly
zone that doesn’t demonize queer characters,

208
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.050
we are covertly warping their fragile little
minds into thinking that they, themselves,

209
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.050
are queer.

210
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.050
Reminds me of something…

211
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.310
At a public hearing in Dade County, Florida,
parents were enraged.

212
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.240
The nation, they said, was in peril, and children
were at risk.

213
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.920
All because of the increasing rights of LGBTQ
people in their communities.

214
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.870
Well, not THEIR communities, they’d argue,
but communities around them.

215
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.990
Action had to be taken, and a campaign to
limit the legal rights of LGBTQ people — all

216
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.710
in the name of protecting children — was
enacted.

217
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.839
A woman who spoke at this hearing said it
was her right to control “the moral atmosphere

218
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.620
in which my children grow up.”

219
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:45.029
The year was 1977 and that woman was Anita
Bryant, a former Miss Oklahoma best known

220
00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:47.100
for her Florida orange juice commercials.

221
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.150
Bryant spearheaded an anti-queer campaign
of such impact that it still echoes in today’s

222
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.150
rhetoric.

223
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.430
“It’s a contemporary version on these
older attempts to annul homosexuality,”

224
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.670
said Lillian Faderman, author of ‘The Gay
Revolution.’

225
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.740
“In the present environment, you can’t
go after homosexual teachers anymore.

226
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.149
We have too many allies.

227
00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:10.590
And so Florida has found another way to do
it by this ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, which

228
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.160
doesn’t go after homosexual teachers precisely.

229
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.300
But the idea is the same.

230
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.940
That is, that homosexuality is a pariah status,
and it shouldn’t be discussed in the public

231
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.000
schools.”

232
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
When Bryant began her campaign in 1977, she
had four children, and often said she was

233
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.640
speaking as “a mother and a Christian.”

234
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.520
And while the villainization of queer people
was not new, Bryant took the idea of protecting

235
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.710
children from us and made it mainstream.

236
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.670
Her campaign and the subsequent “Save Our
Children” political coalition used the argument

237
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.220
that: “homosexuals cannot reproduce, so
they must recruit.”

238
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.370
I want to know what pills these people are
popping.

239
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.250
If we actually had the power to turn people
gay do you think for a second we wouldn’t

240
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.430
have abducted Chris Evans and forced him to
watch Death Becomes Her on a loop, like Clockwork

241
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.810
Orange style by now?

242
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.180
“En garde…

243
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.180
BITCH.”

244
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.180
Anyway.

245
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.520
Opposition to Bryant’s campaign, and the
anti-gay bills across America that ended up

246
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.620
passing because of it, led to a rise in queer
activism.

247
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.899
“The thing to remember is that Anita Bryant
won that battle initially, but she did not

248
00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:13.790
win that war,” said the historian Julio
Capó Jr.

249
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.500
“It was transformative.

250
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.060
It got people to see themselves as a voting
bloc.

251
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.380
It got them to see that their very existence
and their rights were very much under attack

252
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.190
in a different way than we had seen in a decade
prior.”

253
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.470
Though the times have changed significantly
since Bryant’s heyday in the late ‘70s,

254
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.709
it appears the views of her kind of bigot
have not.

255
00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:38.300
From American suburbs to a castle in Edinburgh,
Scotland, the close-minded still fight to

256
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.860
restrict our rights.

257
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.050
Which is why I think this new Netflix show
is so important.

258
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.080
But before we get on our knees and praise
Netflix to the high heavens for deigning to

259
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.280
provide us with queer content, bear in mind
that this is the same studio that aired Dave

260
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.160
Chapelle’s comedy special that lacked for
comedy but was abundant in hot takes that

261
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.220
nobody asked for.

262
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.910
And after refusing to remove the special,
suffering employee walk-outs, and enduring

263
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.770
an all-too-short-lived stretch of bad press,
they signed Chapelle on for another multi-million

264
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.589
dollar deal.

265
00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:10.780
Which puts us, audiences and queer people,
in a tough situation.

266
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.850
The same situation we’ve been in since about
the 1990s, give or take a decade.

267
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.210
Is it worth a Dave Chapelle comedy special
to get content like Heartstopper, Young Royals,

268
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.220
and the relatively large library of queer
content on Netflix?

269
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.520
From a business point of view, these queer
shows are very popular on their own.

270
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.210
Can we even make the argument that the subscribers
brought in by Dave Chapelle are what fund

271
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.710
these projects?

272
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.360
Or are the queer shows what have given Netflix
the money to be able to greenlight and buy

273
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.560
up his specials?

274
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.480
Let’s not forget that Orange is the New
Black was one of Netflix’s first big hits.

275
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.860
Are we dependent on bigotry for our representation?

276
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.029
Are we okay seeing the money we bring in be
used to provide a platform for intolerance?

277
00:15:53.029 --> 00:15:54.779
Is Netflix just playing the field?

278
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.130
One for us, one for them?

279
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.029
Even that thinking is flawed.

280
00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:01.670
Bigotry doesn’t have a right to an equal
platform with queer representation.

281
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:07.000
Because queer representation seeks to promote
and celebrate the existence of PEOPLE — bigotry

282
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.700
seeks to limit and revoke the freedoms of
those people.

283
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.029
One group of people wants to exist in peace
— the other wants that first group to not

284
00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:16.029
exist at all.

285
00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:20.040
Advancing the progress of queer rights will
not hurt anyone.

286
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.209
Advancing the rights of bigotry will hurt
people.

287
00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:27.570
Advancing both at the same time will result
in a reduction of rights, freedoms, and safety

288
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.589
for queer people — which is why bigots invent
arguments that claim that the queer agenda

289
00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:35.030
is out to disrupt social spaces.

290
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.610
And this just happens to be the political
landscape we’re currently living in.

291
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.520
And because we’re giving airtime to both
groups, it makes sense that queer rights are

292
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.959
losing ground.

293
00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:49.339
And not to be an alarmist, but we ARE losing
ground.

294
00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:54.960
Conservatives are successfully banning the
existence of queer people from anywhere children

295
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.080
exist, and people who have convinced themselves
that they’re feminists want to erase the

296
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.510
existence of trans people from…

297
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.640
well, existence.

298
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.490
So for a show to come out directed toward
teens and preteens that shows queer characters

299
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.429
as, not only human beings, but normal human
beings…

300
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:12.850
with normal problems.

301
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.310
With friends and families who care about them.

302
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.790
Gay teens, bisexual teens, trans teens, lesbian
teens.

303
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.640
This feels like a big deal.

304
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.760
The producers probably didn’t think it would
be as big a deal as it is when they first

305
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.700
bought the rights, all the way back in 2019,
but it is.

306
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.150
What could have been just a cute little show
about queer teens living their lives has inadvertently

307
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:41.800
become a middle finger to the bigots stretching
their arms across the US and the UK.

308
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:47.830
Heartstopper is sweet, adorable, sometimes
painfully corny, and exactly what we need

309
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.970
right now.

310
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.700
Between this and Our Flag Means Death, I’m
actually starting to have hope in Western

311
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.950
Media’s portrayals of queer characters.

312
00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:11.500
Let’s keep this trend going and put the
bigots back in 

313
00:18:11.500 --> 00:20:34.179
the closet.
