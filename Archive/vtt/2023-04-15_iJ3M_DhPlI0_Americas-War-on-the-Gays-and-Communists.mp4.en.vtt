00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
as the second world war ended and masses
of servicemen returned home to America

2
00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.240
having spent almost all of their time
away exclusively with other men there

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.320
seemed to be an opening of the minds of
the American populace when it came to

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.100
homosexuality not that it was an
acceptable alternative to

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
heterosexuality now but that it wasn't
the worst thing in the world usually

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
under the caveat that it would be
something a man would grow out of

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.180
how Italian but politicians who did not
serve their country in Europe or the

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.399
South Pacific did not see this new
momentary mindset as a good thing

9
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.300
instead they saw it as a corrupting
influence on America's men just as bad

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.680
if not worse than the ghostly specter of
Communism they feared would make its way

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.640
to the United States after American boys
spent so much time with Russians over in

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.739
Europe and so began the Red Scare in
Washington DC as politicians led a

13
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
crusade against actual and perceived
Communists working within the Beltway

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.420
and it didn't take long for them to
broaden their scope to include actual

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.939
and perceived homosexuals as well with
almost 5 000 gay people having lost

16
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.020
their jobs in Washington by the end of
the scare the lavender scare became a

17
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.340
Witch Hunt for Boogeyman just as
terrifying as the Communists and as

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.680
Washington took aim at suspected
Communists in Hollywood suspected

19
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.759
homosexuals in Hollywood were added to
the growing Blacklist but before we

43
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.099
in the early 20th century the United
States experienced a period of political

44
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.019
persecution and anxiety known as the Red
Scare there were two different eras in

45
00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
American history that are collectively
known as the Red Scare both of which

46
00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.000
were marked by widespread anxiety over
communism and other leftist ideas the

47
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.599
first Red Scare happened in the wake of
World War One and is rarely spoken about

48
00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.400
and the second occurred in the midst of
the Cold War in the late 1940s and early

49
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.919
1950s to a considerable extent the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was to

50
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.639
blame for the onset of the first Red
Scare it's no secret that many Americans

51
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.759
especially those in positions of
authority were worried about the

52
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.960
emergence of the Soviet Union and the
expansion of Communism in Europe in

53
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.259
response to this perceived threat the
American government enacted a set of

54
00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.320
laws intended to limit the freedoms of
those who were either Communists or

55
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.520
sympathizers of the Communist cause the
Sedition Act of 1918 was one of the most

56
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.600
notorious pieces of legislation enacted
at the time because it made it a crime

57
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.979
to criticize is the government anyone
suspected of being a communist or

58
00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.180
Anarchist was subject to prosecution
under these statutes regardless of

59
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.020
whether or not they had committed any
real crimes the American Protective

60
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.800
League was one of the several private
groups formed during the first Red Scare

61
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.660
with the authority to investigate and
report on suspected's verses during the

62
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.139
height of the red scared the American
Legion spearheaded a drive to identify

63
00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.820
and punish suspected traitors after
World War II tensions between the United

64
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.199
States and the Soviet Union grew once
again sparking the second Red Scare

65
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.280
during this time communism was again
considered a major danger to American

66
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.600
democracy and its way of life the
inquiry undertaken by Senator Joseph

67
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.520
McCarthy known as the McCarthy hearings
was one of the most important events of

68
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.060
the second Red Scare McCarthy claimed to
have a list of people who were either

69
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.580
Communist party members or sympathizers
and he used his position in government

70
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.320
to initiate a series of Investigations
and interrogations to flush them out

71
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.180
dramatic confrontations and high profile
charges typified the McCarthy hearings

72
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.560
which had far-reaching effects on
American culture many individuals were

73
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.759
punished for their suspected communist
links even though there was no proof to

74
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.720
back up the claims Witnesses were
questioned under duress throughout the

75
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.039
trials to get them to identify other
Communists who were under suspicion even

76
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.139
if they were judged not to be communist
supporters many people were blacklisted

77
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.860
and lost their employment as a
consequence of the proceedings because

78
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.560
of McCarthy and his associates harsh
methods and disregard for due process

79
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.419
the hearings became notorious
but the hearings came to an end in 1954

80
00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.900
when McCarthy was censured by the senate
for his conduct during the

81
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.620
investigations marking the beginning of
the end of McCarthy's political career

82
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.960
the hearings are now widely viewed as a
dark chapter in American history in 1950

83
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.400
many politicians journalists and
citizens thought that homosexuals

84
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.300
actually posed more of a threat to
National Security than Communists one

85
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.319
columnist argued there is no record of
comparable corruption in American

86
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.720
history in a national radio broadcast
noted liberal Elmer Davis said it looks

87
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.500
as if the enemies of the state
department and of the administration

88
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.180
generally have gotten hold of a more
profitable issue than communism Senator

89
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.800
Kenneth weary asked his Senate
colleagues can you think of a person who

90
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.080
would be more dangerous to the United
States than a pervert and

91
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.660
multiple of President Harry Truman's top
advisors wrote him memos stating the

92
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.180
country is more concerned about the
charges of homosexuals in government

93
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:33.300
than about Communists in the UK it was
just about social Purity yet in America

94
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.759
the existence of gay men specifically
was somehow a matter of life and death

95
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:42.000
historians of the McCarthy period have
paid surprisingly little attention to

96
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.139
the lavender scare despite the
widespread worry and even Panic it

97
00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.580
caused at the time the significance of
Party politics and foreign policy in the

98
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.780
emergence of the National Security State
is emphasized by political historians of

99
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.039
McCarthyism anti-communism and the
establishment of the National Security

100
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:04.680
State while the role of moral and
cultural concerns is downplayed anytime

101
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.259
the lavender scare is discussed it is as
an afterthought of the Red Scare that is

102
00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:15.000
so obvious that it doesn't ever need
explanation the overlapping worries of

103
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.180
Communism in homosexual quality have
been largely ignored in even the most

104
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.960
recent examinations of McCarthyism both
the defenses from the right and

105
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.460
criticisms from the left many people who
supported McCarthy back in the 1950s

106
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.060
considered the systemic expulsion of
gays from the state department and other

107
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.520
government positions to be his most
lasting achievement senator Joseph

108
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.860
McCarthy alleged in February of 1950
that there were 205 Communists working

109
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.180
in the state department that's a month
under Secretary of State John Purifoy

110
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.339
said that the state department had
permitted 91 homosexuals to retire after

111
00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.180
this some said the president Harry
Truman's government was insufficiently

112
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.019
concerned about the threat posed by
homosexuals the Senate started looking

113
00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:02.040
into homosexuals working for the
government in June of 1950. although the

114
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.640
findings weren't made public until
December throughout that time there was

115
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.140
a sharp rise in the number of government
employees let go because of homophobic

116
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.760
harassment or discrimination when asked
about quote sexual perverts who have

117
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.899
infiltrated our government in recent
years Republican National chairman guy

118
00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:23.279
George gabrielson claimed that they were
perhaps as dangerous as the actual

119
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.000
Communists however being homosexual
wasn't the only reason they were in

120
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.019
danger homosexuals were observed as
security threats because they were

121
00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.580
believed to be more vulnerable to
Blackmail as top counsel of his

122
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.200
Congressional subcommittee McCarthy
employed Roy Cohn who himself was

123
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.760
homosexual and died of AIDS decades
later because of his attempts to protect

124
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.200
his reputation he insisted that his
doctor treat him for liver cancer so at

125
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200
the same time that his immune system was
dying he was undergoing Cancer

126
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.500
Treatments that destroyed what was left
of his white blood cells at the same

127
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.220
time he also pulled what strings he
could to get on the experimental HIV

128
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.660
medication that was still undergoing
medical trials AZT which

129
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.920
destroyed his liver someday we will
progress as a community to the point

130
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.060
where the only remaining Legacy of Roy
Cohn is as the villain of Tony kushner's

131
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.399
iconic stage play angels in America
but we're not quite there yet because

132
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.260
Cohn and McCarthy with the help of FBI
director J Edgar Hoover who is also

133
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.980
believed to have been gay were
responsible for the dismissal of

134
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.820
thousands of gay government employees
and the intimidation of many of their

135
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.140
political opponents into Silence by
spreading false allegations about their

136
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.060
sexual orientation the state department
revealed that it had dismissed 425

137
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.480
workers due to charges of homosexuality
in the closing months of the Truman

138
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.339
Administration in 1953. McCarthy's
anti-communist campaign often fused the

139
00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:51.839
second Red Scare with the lavender scare
by using allegations of homosexuality as

140
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:56.279
a smear tactic reporters were once
subjected to the following statement if

141
00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:00.180
you want to be against McCarthy Boys
you've got to either be a communist or a

142
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.260
 when proof of communist
activity was absent McCarthy allegedly

143
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.220
used guilt by association by equating
communism and homosexuality with mental

144
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.660
instability the general public and even
politicians had a common view that gays

145
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.540
and Communists were both morally weak or
psychologically Disturbed as well as

146
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.040
Godless and destructive to traditional
families for instance McCarthy openly

147
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.600
discussed two individuals case 14 and
case 62 on the senate floor as

148
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.180
Communists who posed unsafe risks due to
their homosexuality he said that a

149
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.660
high-ranking intelligence officer had
informed him that every active communist

150
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.100
is Twisted mentally or physically
implying that those with the peculiar

151
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.079
mental twists of homosexuality were more
susceptible to recruitment by Communists

152
00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:50.519
many of the male workers at the state
department started to feel uncomfortable

153
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:53.760
even being there because of the
Department's new association with

154
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.079
homosexuality they were quite adamant
about not being seen in pairs and they

155
00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:01.920
often introduced themselves with words
emphasizing their straightness hi I'm so

156
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.560
and so I work for the state department
and I'm married and I have three

157
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.420
children executive order 104.50 enacted
by President Eisenhower in 1953

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.140
prohibited gays from holding federal
government positions and established

159
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.100
security criteria for federal employment
as a direct result of these policies

160
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.500
hundreds of openly gay State Department
employees were outed and fired about 5

161
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.820
000 gay individuals including private
contractors and military personnel lost

162
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.380
their jobs at the federal government as
a result of this presidential order the

163
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.019
victims were not only fired from
employment

164
00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:38.220
but also outed to the public this
presidential order expanded Truman's

165
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.720
loyalty program by including sexual
perversion among the actions that

166
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.980
disqualified a person from holding a
federal post many new rules and

167
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.480
practices were implemented to identify
and expel persons who identify as

168
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.399
homosexual lesbian or bisexual it was
common practice to conduct interviews

169
00:12:56.399 --> 00:13:01.380
and check for overt displays of
homosexual biases as part of these new

170
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.579
methods to detect gaze people were
judged guilty not just by connection

171
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:09.600
with those who frequented the same
homosexual clubs as the suspects they

172
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.620
may also be questioned if members of
their immediate or extended family had

173
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.720
gay Tendencies or gay connections by the
mid-1950s similar repressive and

174
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.440
oppressive policies had been enacted in
States and local governments as well

175
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.779
expanding bans on hiring lesbians and
gay men to cover 12 million workers more

176
00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:32.160
than 20 percent of the United States
labor force all of whom were required to

177
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.019
sign Oaths attesting to their moral
Purity in order to obtain or maintain

178
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:41.040
employment but McCarthy's crew of
homophobes were about to have the sites

179
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.180
trained on themselves when Roy Cohn
brought on G David shine as Chief

180
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.019
consultant to the McCarthy staff
speculation arose that shine and Cohn

181
00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:53.339
had a sexual relationship during the
Army McCarthy hearings Cohn denied being

182
00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:57.360
closer than an ordinary friend to shine
or having any special interest in him

183
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.260
Army Council Joseph Welch seemed to
elude to cohn's sexual orientation

184
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.320
throughout the proceedings did you think
this came from a big

185
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.740
Define
you might be an expert on that yeah yeah

186
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.720
I should say
I should say Mr Senator that a pixie is

187
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.459
a close relative of a fairy McCarthy's
unwavering support for cone fueled

188
00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:27.839
rumors that the senator was either
coerced by his senior counsel or that

189
00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:32.399
their relationship went beyond
professional boundaries McCarthy often

190
00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:37.079
engaged in homosexual activities Nevada
publisher Hank Greenspun said in 1952

191
00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:39.959
and claimed that he was a regular at the
White Horse Inn

192
00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:43.920
a Milwaukee gay nightclub all this
attention eventually led to Roy Cohn

193
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.120
being removed from his post alongside
McCarthy and helped fuel McCarthy's own

194
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.260
downfall in due time the McCarthy period
as a whole came to an end in the middle

195
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.240
of the 1950s when Nicole V young
judgment in 1956 significantly reduced

196
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.079
the authority to remove anyone from the
federal government with discriminatory

197
00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:05.459
grounds however the lavender scare
continued for many more decades the

198
00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:08.820
Florida legislative investigative
committee also known as the Johns

199
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.420
committee or flick was another
manifestation of the lavender scare that

200
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.079
endured established in 1956 the flick
lasted until 1964 before being dissolved

201
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:22.800
the committee's mission in Florida was
to investigate and fire homosexual

202
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.300
Public School teachers carrying on the
lavender scare and spirit if not

203
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.320
entirely in practice and it wasn't until
the Obama Administration that military

204
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.399
service for openly gay people was
allowed since the don't ask don't tell

205
00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:41.880
policy was just another executive order
104.50 under a different name but though

206
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.600
the lavender scare unofficially came to
an end with the fall of McCarthyism

207
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.380
after multiple Decisions by the Supreme
Court defanged the senator and left him

208
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.120
nothing but a paper tiger The Fear and
Loathing toward homosexuals as well as

209
00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.600
accused Communists survived much longer
in Hollywood even before McCarthy began

210
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.680
his Crusade producers in California had
been blacklisting anyone even remotely

211
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.220
connected to Communism thanks to
pressure from future president of the

212
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.760
United States Ronald Reagan who was then
the president of the Screen Actors Guild

213
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.600
many Hollywood professionals were called
to appear before the house on American

214
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.339
Activities Committee in October of 1947.
it was announced that the committee

215
00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:24.360
would look into allegations that
communist spies and supporters had

216
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.220
planted propaganda in Hollywood movies
Walt Disney spoke first during the

217
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.540
proceedings Disney testified that
Communists posed a severe danger to the

218
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.040
film business and identified many former
employees as possible Communists in

219
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.180
contrast other leading Hollywood figures
including director John Houston and

220
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.500
actors Humphrey Bogart Lauren Bacall
Judy Garland and Danny Kaye organized

221
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.800
the committee for the First Amendment to
protest the government's targeting of

222
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.339
the film industry of the people working
in Hollywood that the house on American

223
00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:57.240
Activities Committee was interested in
many were accused of being members of

224
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.639
the communist Party USA of the initial
witness list of 43 19 declared that they

225
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:06.480
would not give evidence 11 of the
original 19 were questioned by the panel

226
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.760
on Monday October 27th the hearings last
phase began and members of the committee

227
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.880
for the First Amendment traveled in from
throughout the country

228
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.819
to participate only one of the 11
unfriendly Witnesses writer Bertolt

229
00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.439
Breck agreed to speak with the committee
after which he fled the country ten

230
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:29.640
others declined claiming their right to
free expression and assembly under the

231
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.740
First Amendment the question are you now
or have you ever been a member of the

232
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.880
Communist party was one which they flat
out refused to answer the committee

233
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.720
formally accused these ten of contempt
of congress and began criminal

234
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.140
proceedings against them in the Full
House of Representatives the house on

235
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.260
American Activities Committee hearings
failed to turn up any evidence that

236
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.620
Hollywood was secretly disseminating
communist propaganda but the industry

237
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.480
was nonetheless transformed producers
and Studio heads were now on the watch

238
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.100
for any and all anti-American activity
fearing further investigation from the

239
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.419
government especially ones that might
lead to government censorship which

240
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:11.640
they'd only narrowly avoided decades
before so as Hollywood always does they

241
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.440
chose to self-censor before being told
to this began a Crackdown on any

242
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.660
directors writers or actors who might be
communist or gay The Echoes of

243
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.679
McCarthyism were sounding loudly in the
Hollywood Hills and the association

244
00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:29.580
between gay and communist were
inseparable by then and as mentioned in

245
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.820
previous episodes Hollywood was more or
less stuffed full of gay men and women

246
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.960
working in any one of a multitude of
roles in the industry this resulted in

247
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.039
multiple well-respected directors moving
to Europe and sending many more

248
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:45.000
up-and-coming and well-established
actors even further into the closet

249
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.900
suddenly films about the fear of
extraterrestrials became hot tickets in

250
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.919
Hollywood as a narrative device to help
instill fear of anything even slightly

251
00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:56.820
different to the masses of the growing
Suburban America these monsters from

252
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.960
outer space were Communists gays and
people of color these aliens could be

253
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.460
anything and everything John and Martha
were afraid of which thanks to Senator

254
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.660
McCarthy
was a lot of things but no theme was

255
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.660
more prevalent than the alien
shapeshifter the ones who could live

256
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.919
alongside the normal people corrupting
them from within Communists coming for

257
00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:21.360
your husbands gays coming for your sons
the Red Scare and the dread of communist

258
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.100
infiltration into American culture are
commonly seen as metaphors in the 1956

259
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.120
science fiction classic Invasion of the
Body Snatchers the film has also been

260
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.480
seen as a homosexual allegory by any
number of reviewers and Scholars

261
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.120
throughout the years the film's
narrative revolves around an

262
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.960
extraterrestrial invasion of Earth and
the subsequent infiltration of soulless

263
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.120
carbon copy humans developed in pods the
Pod inhabitants begin to symbolize as

264
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.039
the film unfolds a society that is
driven by uniformity and tries to

265
00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:54.960
eliminate individuality and uniqueness
this uniformity and Conformity theme has

266
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.440
been linked to the gay experience in the
1950s ever since

267
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.039
many gay individuals in the past were
pressured to conceal their identities

268
00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:05.880
and mask their sexual orientation
because of the widespread stigma

269
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.480
associated with being gay at the time
the film's depiction of the pod people

270
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.799
paints them as robotic drones devoid a
feeling and individuality in addition

271
00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:17.820
the film's characters are a misfit crew
that the perceived conventional Society

272
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.140
Rejects and ignores people who insist
that something nefarious is occurring

273
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.880
are sometimes branded as insane or
paranoid similar to the experiences of

274
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.580
gay people who were frequently
disregarded and mocked by the larger

275
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.419
society the characters in this story are
members of a minority group who are

276
00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:38.340
trying to persuade the world of a threat
that only they can see Invasion of the

277
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.700
Body Snatchers is undoubtedly a film
that reflects the societal anxieties of

278
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.780
its time and can also be seen as a
powerful gay allegory by exploring

279
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.039
themes of Conformity individuality and
marginalization the film speaks to the

280
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:54.179
experiences of many gay people who
struggle to find Acceptance in a society

281
00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:59.580
that sought to erase their differences
Invaders from Mars features a similar

282
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.539
plot to Invasion of the Body Snatchers
David the film's protagonist is a

283
00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:07.500
creative and sensitive young man who is
ridiculed and excluded from school he

284
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.460
has a difficult time relating to people
even his own father with whom he has a

285
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.240
tense relationship many members of the
queer Community especially around the

286
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.660
time the film was released have
experienced feelings of alienation and

287
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.039
exclusion similar to those shown in the
film actor Arthur Franz who plays

288
00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:26.700
David's father in the film has been
speculated to be homosexual in real life

289
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.620
Morris ankrum who was also thought to be
gay plays Dr kelston an investigator of

290
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.380
the UFO phenomena there are aspects in
Invaders from Mars that may be seen via

291
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.159
a queer lens even if that wasn't the
film's original intent from the

292
00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:44.280
underlying ties between the male
characters to the overt themes of

293
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.500
possession and Invasion the 1939 film
nanochka has also been interpreted by

294
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.400
film critics as an allegory for lesbian
desire and love firstly the character of

295
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.320
Nina played by Greta Garbo is a Stern
and serious Soviet Envoy who comes to

296
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.640
Paris to supervise a group of three
bumbling comrades who have been sent

297
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.960
there to sell Jewels seized during the
Russian Revolution Nina is initially

298
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.240
portrayed as cold and unfeeling but she
begins to thaw as she falls in love with

299
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.039
the Charming and carefree count Leon
dalgol played by Melvin Douglas this

300
00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:20.700
Dynamic of a strict and buttoned up
woman being seduced by a more carefree

301
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:26.460
and flamboyant man is a common Trope in
Classic Hollywood films but it also

302
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.320
mirrors the expectation that more manly
or serious women would lighten up and go

303
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.340
straight eventually the Assumption among
many was after all that the only thing

304
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.760
stopping a lesbian from being a happy
Homemaker was finding the right man

305
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.100
finally there is the character of Irma
played by Bella Lugosi Irma is portrayed

306
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.419
as a flamboyant and Theatrical figure
with a campy and exaggerated manner of

307
00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:51.780
speaking and gesturing while the
character is not explicitly identified

308
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.679
as queer the fact that Lugosi himself
was bisexual and often played roles with

309
00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:59.580
homoerotic undertones has led some
viewers to interpret Irma as a coded

310
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.900
representation of queer desire and from
a completely opposite direction we have

311
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.820
the notorious Plan 9 from Outer Space
from the infamous filmmaker Ed Wood

312
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.080
while the film has long been considered
a cinematic disaster it has also been

313
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.880
celebrated for its campy subversive
qualities in particular many critics and

314
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.840
Scholars have interpreted the film as a
queer allegory one way in which the film

315
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.440
can be seen as a queer allegory is
through the character of the alien

316
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.260
leader Eros Eros is portrayed as a
flamboyant effeminate figure with his

317
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.360
distinctive attire makeup and mannerisms
he moves with a graceful almost poetic

318
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.500
quality and his speech is melodramatic
and Theatrical his characterization is

319
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.059
so exaggerated that it goes well beyond
mere stereotyping and instead creates a

320
00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:49.620
queer icon that challenges and subverts
traditional gender Norms another aspect

321
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.860
of the film that can be interpreted as a
queer allegory is its underlying

322
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.940
critique of Conformity the plot revolves
around the alien's plan to destroy Earth

323
00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.500
because they view it as a threat to
their own culture and way of life this

324
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.159
can be seen as a commentary on the
obsessive forces of Conformity that

325
00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:09.360
queer individuals have often faced the
aliens desire for uniformity and

326
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.740
sameness can be read as a metaphor for
the societal pressures to conform to

327
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.820
heteronormative standards and
expectations and even the internal

328
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.720
expectations of the queer Community
finally the film's low budget campy

329
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.559
style can be seen as a celebration of
the marginal and the underground

330
00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:30.659
in the context of queer culture Camp has
often been used as a way to resist and

331
00:24:30.659 --> 00:24:34.919
subvert dominant cultural norms the
film's deliberately bad acting special

332
00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:39.299
effects and overall production value can
be seen as a queer refusal to conform to

333
00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:42.900
traditional Hollywood standards or maybe
I'm reaching a bit with that one but

334
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.059
suffice to say the 1950s were a time of
strict social conformity in America the

335
00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:51.419
culture was dominated by the ideal of
the nuclear family where a husband

336
00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:54.840
worked and provided for his wife and
children while the wife stayed at home

337
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.580
and took care of the household any
deviation from this Norm was considered

338
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.980
dangerously deviant and subject to
social ostracization this of course

339
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.780
included homosexuality which was widely
seen as a mental illness or a moral

340
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.919
failing gay people in the 1950s faced
significant depression from the dominant

341
00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:18.780
culture as well as legal and social
sanctions homosexuality was illegal in

342
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.980
every state and those who were caught
engaging in same-sex activities could

343
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.279
face imprisonment or
institutionalization in mental hospitals

344
00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:30.179
in this culture of fear and secrecy gay
people were forced to hide their true

345
00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:35.700
selves and Lead double lives whereas
suspected communist agents chose to lead

346
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.659
double lives many gay men and women were
also forced into marriages with the

347
00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:43.440
opposite sex in order to maintain
appearances and avoid suspicion these

348
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.279
marriages were often unhappy and
unfulfilling for both partners and they

349
00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:51.480
often ended in divorce or estrangement
this further reinforced the idea that

350
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.679
homosexuality was a choice and that gay
people could choose to be straight if

351
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.980
they wanted to gays and lesbians were
also subject to violence and

352
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.940
discrimination in many areas gay bars
were the only places where they could

353
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.320
meet and socialize however these spaces
were often raided by police who would

354
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.340
arrest patrons and subject them to
violence and humiliation These Bars were

355
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.020
actually rated more often than suspected
communist hideouts gays and lesbians

356
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.200
were considered easier targets by the
police and since the government believed

357
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.860
a queer person could easily be turned
communist arresting them was killing two

358
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.880
birds with one stone the policing of
gender norms and the emphasis on

359
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.380
Conformity made it nearly impossible for
gays and lesbians to be themselves and

360
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.640
live fulfilling lives it wasn't until
the Stonewall riots of 1969 and the

361
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.480
subsequent gay rights movement that
things began to change in America but

362
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.700
Hollywood would begin to ease up on the
depiction of gay people in the 1960s

363
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.740
but mostly in coded ways but even with
deep deep coding

364
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.820
there was a catch
anyone confirmed to be gay or even

365
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.320
heavily coded to be
wouldn't have it easy and to live a life

366
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.600
true to themselves
they might just have to die for it
