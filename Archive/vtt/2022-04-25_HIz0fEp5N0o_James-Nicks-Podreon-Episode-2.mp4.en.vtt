4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400

6
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.880
seen shit's creek and i've just seen so
many memes like it's become a part of

7
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.480
the culture i have i do need to watch it
and that actually leads into our topic

8
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.239
topic because most people don't know
shit's creek as the canadian tv show

9
00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.200
that for a minute had the canadian
government

10
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
rethinking the way that it funds our
media our weird nationalistic art bill

11
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.399
and then changed its mind to continue to
be stupid and national but they know it

12
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.239
as the netflix series that hit netflix
series that won all the emmys in this

13
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.280
last season yeah
um

14
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.920
and uh
yeah because this week on the poderon

15
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.479
patreon we're going to be talking about
streaming services because netflix this

16
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.960
week took a
bit of a dive off a cliff and everyone's

17
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
in panic mode trying to figure out why
did this happen look a bit and and it's

18
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.799
obvious why it happened and we're going
to talk about that yeah so

19
00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.640
netflix sorry as i recall this is
netflix's first subscriber drop ever

20
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.439
ever i forget the amount that they
dropped i think it was

21
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.880
200 000 they lost that's not
unsubstantial

22
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.360
i can't remember the exact amount and i
don't have my laptop in front of me so

23
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.040
i'm just gonna go i have mine now you
wanna uh go follow me they lost a bunch

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.560
of subscribers yeah um
and because they lost a bunch of

25
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.000
subscribe bunch of subscribers that
meant that they also lost a bunch of

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.479
worth on the stock market because people
who invest in stocks don't know how to

27
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.640
play the long game at all and they
panicked and funny story about what

28
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.120
happened in 1928 in new york 29. that
was 28 29. okay because it was like the

29
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.000
end of the roaring 20s yeah that's i
thought there was like that's why i

30
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.959
thought there was two years so um what
happens everyone knows about the great

31
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.400
depression but nobody knows exactly why
it happened

32
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.280
yeah
so once everyone knows that there was a

33
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.520
stock market crash yeah what happened
was throughout the 20s it was just after

34
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.239
world war one people decided that we
were done with the old world old money

35
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.400
values of europe because that led to the
world's most devastating conflict

36
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.800
possibly in history including a world
war ii it was time for a good time yeah

37
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.200
it was time for a good time um and so
which i'm hoping after this pandemic is

38
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.879
over we will have a new roaring 20s what
what happened was um

39
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.400
they basically invented the stock market
in this period of time where the globe

40
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.280
was no the stock market's been around
for a while oh yeah but in terms of just

41
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.680
opening it up to the public as making it
as accessible as it was yeah uh it was

42
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.599
this wild new idea where you know like
people were exchanging money and getting

43
00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.560
literally rich overnight
um nobody knew how it worked um funny

44
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.440
story nothing's changed yeah i still
don't know

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.720
it's just that now people get rich in
minutes so

46
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.159
to start or lose everything thanks also
were the 1920s were also a period of

47
00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.000
strong republican control over america
and that's

48
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.040
deregulation regularization which means
banks could hand out credit not loans

49
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.959
credit for literally nothing and banks
were getting rich off of this people

50
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.519
were getting rich off this people were
going broke and killing themselves off

51
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.720
this evening but loans are credit oh
yeah but like you know like lines of

52
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280
credit rather than just like we're gonna
give you this lump sum it's like we're

53
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.319
going to manage your credit through our
institution

54
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.599
um
so people

55
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.799
got loans and then invested in the stock
market with loaned money

56
00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.360
which is still how most people do it and
but and this was on mass in the 20s um

57
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.159
a lot of people
get a loan

58
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.239
to
put into their retirement fund so that

59
00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.439
they can start
putting into it early

60
00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.479
and pay it off and it's it's dumb but
like terms like boom and bust did not

61
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.400
apply did not register to the average
person they didn't exist in the stock

62
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.759
market the stock market was the same
thing it goes it's like a woman's it's

63
00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.400
like a ladies games they just go up and
up and up um

64
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.320
i love 20 slang so much
um

65
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.680
so people were just throwing money
around and you know as what happens with

66
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.919
boom and bust sometimes supply and
demand stuff the 1930 going into the

67
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.800
1930s and the late 20s there was
beginning to be a drought in the

68
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.440
american midwest
um the stock the stock known as the dust

69
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.639
bowl for the historians in the crowd the
stock price of wheat

70
00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.919
they felt the need to applaud

71
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.039
our loving audience
um

72
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.720
the stock market price for wheat
wheat like you know the grain that comes

73
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.360
out of the ground i'm explaining to the
audience because like i know you know i

74
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080
think this is amazing but i don't i need
to emphasize like that i think this is

75
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.080
insane the stock price of wheat dipped
slightly

76
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.759
very slightly you know like okay it's a
it's not like an overnight drop it was

77
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.360
like you know it's okay this is a yeah
this is a drop

78
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.759
um
everyone

79
00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.000
on it wasn't like when the ruble dropped
and oh yeah yeah it was just russia had

80
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.280
to shut down their stock exchange it was
just a little dip it wasn't anything

81
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.320
that wouldn't happen that wouldn't have
recovered over another week or two yeah

82
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.800
everyone at that at the exact same
moment on the stock market floor in new

83
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840
york on in 1929 apparently um it might
have been 28. i'm pretty sure it was 29

84
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.560
but um everyone
flipped a literal [ __ ]

85
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.400
um and everyone sold sales out yes
everyone sold everything they had in

86
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.160
wheat
um which drove the price of wheat into

87
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.360
the ground yeah dipped it down even
further

88
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.639
which then destroyed the global economy
and what this has to do with netflix

89
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.000
is that that's kind of what happens in
today's stock market is when

90
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.880
something has a bad day
um when netflix puts out and says

91
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.360
they've lost subscribers
when

92
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.199
you know a company comes out and says
when nintendo says it's going to start

93
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.360
implementing mandatory vacation time for
their yeah when apple says you know we

94
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.560
sold 20 billion iphones instead of 30
billion iphones um

95
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.880
there is huge sell-offs and a lot of
times companies will lose

96
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.080
billions and billions and billions and
billions of dollars in these sell-offs

97
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.680
which will make stock worth a whole lot
less money which then

98
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.560
opens it up for people with less money
to actually buy the stock if they're

99
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.919
smart because they know it's going to go
back up because it's not like netflix's

100
00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.199
stock is going to stay down
um

101
00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.120
and so
because of that

102
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.720
now because of the stock
sell-off

103
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.240
the minor stock sell-off of netflix and
relatively minor and the fact that they

104
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.520
have lost subscribers for the first time
ever

105
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.160
um net subscribers lost net subscribers
yeah net loss um

106
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.680
people are now like oh my god is this
the death of netflix this is the end and

107
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.000
it's like

108
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.120
yeah this reaction 100 years later this
reactionary thinking has not gone away

109
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.840
and it's because
here's the thing with streaming services

110
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.039
streaming services
have a thing called churn

111
00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.039
and that is when and it's something that
a lot of streaming services take into

112
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.680
account and it is that people will
subscribe to

113
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.400
disney plus for two months while one
division is on and then they'll cancel

114
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.599
their subscription they'll go over to
amazon prime and then all the shows that

115
00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:58.960
they use and then watch
whatever comes out then the boys and the

116
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.360
shows that they've missed and then
they'll go over to apple tv apple tv and

117
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.720
then they'll go well depend and then
they'll go over to paramount plus et

118
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.160
cetera et cetera so on and so forth and
they'll cycle back around to netflix

119
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.319
cycle recognition no no no no no no let
me finish okay let me finish you are

120
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:17.520
uninformed so this is what you informed
me the other day nobody has churned

121
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.759
netflix before
netflix is the solid one

122
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.520
that's the one that doesn't get churned
now it is

123
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.160
churnable because there's too many sure
no

124
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.479
if you ask investors yes
um

125
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.760
but because
uh

126
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.880
because netflix was never really the
churn into that um

127
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.720
that was never really taken into account
and

128
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.920
because netflix was all they were
putting out so much content all the time

129
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.959
why would you ever leave netflix there
was always something new to watch

130
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.399
but netflix has been raising their
prices

131
00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:01.760
consistent consistently um multiple
times since the pandemic started the

132
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.040
prices have gone up i remember
when the pandemic started for

133
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.279
four screens with
hd

134
00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.200
streaming
i was paying 12.99 a month and that's

135
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.160
like double that isn't it now i'm paying
something like 25 for four screens in 4k

136
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.680
not everything isn't most things are not
in 4k on netflix um

137
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.920
but so it has basically doubled over the
course of two years and that was after

138
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.480
netflix was 7.99 for a decade
um

139
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.720
now disney plus has that price
no disney plus has gone up

140
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.000
um
but yeah like that the double jump is

141
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.920
insane over two years yeah huge jump and
the sort of argument is well you can go

142
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.399
down to a lower tier do you need all
four screens can you do two maybe one

143
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:57.040
and stuff like that and it's and it's
because what they're trying to do is

144
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.320
get rid of
uh account sharing

145
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.360
because a lot of people are you know
sharing their accounts with family

146
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.320
members with friends stuff like that and
they want to get rid of that and that's

147
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.600
why the prices have been going up to be
like okay if you want those four screens

148
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.519
you're gonna be paying more
um to try and make up for the fact that

149
00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:18.240
they are that there are people not
subscribing because they're basically

150
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.720
getting it through their family yeah um
and so that's what they've been trying

151
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
to get rid of but now people are just
unsubscribing because it's too expensive

152
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.600
yeah and people instead of gaining
subscribers like they thought

153
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.839
people are unsubscribing because it's
too expensive because when you go when

154
00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:38.480
like say you've cut the cord you don't
have cable anymore

155
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:45.600
um when you do netflix and hbo max and
paramount plus and apple tv and uh

156
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.240
amazon prime it's a cable package again
yeah you're paying i saw that

157
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.720
when everyone started announcing like
this was like two or three years ago

158
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.640
when everyone started announcing their
own personal pets uh streaming a

159
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.079
streaming service this is when
um amazon prime is out and disney plus

160
00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.680
there was it was hulu netflix and amazon
prime and those were kind of like the

161
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.160
ones yeah and then apple disney hbo max
uh peacock discovery

162
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
yeah like they all started coming it's
just everything dropped and everyone was

163
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.440
like okay so this is cable again yeah
it's cable again

164
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.800
people called it and
um especially because like streaming

165
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.880
services were advertised as the
alternative to cable

166
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.040
specifically netflix because netflix was
like everything you love is here yeah

167
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.399
and then with all the new streaming
services popping up networks were

168
00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:38.480
pulling their content from netflix yeah
and so netflix needed to produce more

169
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.680
content and so they went into a massive
amount of debt to produce a ton of new

170
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.360
content which was one of the reasons
they needed to up their prices because

171
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.200
they went into a massive amount of debt
um

172
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.000
and
because of that now you know they've

173
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.120
lost the subscribers and everything so
now what they're talking about is okay

174
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.959
well what we'll do
is we're not going to allow multiple

175
00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:04.639
screens anymore
um that's one of their ideas like an

176
00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:08.399
account is an account you have your
account and it is for your household and

177
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.880
that is it
um

178
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.920
and one of their other ideas is like a
599 subscription with ads

179
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.040
um which is completely antithetical to
yeah that's netflix's original mission

180
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.279
statement
um

181
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:26.880
and so they're trying to like figure out
oh and they're severely cutting back on

182
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.399
their animation animation department
yeah they're cutting back in their

183
00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.519
animation department because animation
is very expensive they were putting a

184
00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:37.279
lot of money into it and it wasn't
getting the results

185
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:41.440
that other things on netflix like a
documentary get yeah documentaries are

186
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.680
much cheaper to produce than an animated
series and especially the animation

187
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.720
quality that netflix goes for yeah um i
haven't actually seen any of netflix's

188
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.600
animation that was oh my god yeah i
thought that was produced by riot and

189
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.440
then just bought by netflix no like
that's netflix uh the castlevania was

190
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.959
netflix
um okay like yeah so like that wasn't

191
00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:06.720
netflix goes for high quality animation
i guess that's why i didn't peg it as

192
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.440
netflix because when i assumed like oh
netflix has an animation department i'm

193
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.320
like okay they do like you know blue sky
stuff i was the other one love death

194
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.959
robots
uh love death and robots was not stellar

195
00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:20.800
i watched the first season well won a
bunch of emmys oh well yeah

196
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.399
um but um we won't talk about it
but yeah so they're they're cutting back

197
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.560
on that uh because they have a lot of
animation that is just children's

198
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.000
animation
that does very very well because it it

199
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.800
becomes the babysitter
like coco melon and things like that um

200
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.160
and so they're like okay we're gonna
continue to produce that because that is

201
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.560
bringing in the subscribers people like
the the view minutes are there because

202
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.320
people are plopping their kids down in
front of the tv and so we're you know

203
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.680
that is worth it but you know but is
arcane worth it castlevania was a bit

204
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.480
niche on its own like well yeah like is
the adult animation worth it for them is

205
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.639
what they're kind of asking now
um and

206
00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:07.199
the thing that's just boggling my brain
is that so many people

207
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:11.279
you know entertainment commenters and
business commentators and stuff like

208
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:15.360
that are trying to you know
are saying you know could this be the

209
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.519
end of netflix and everything and it's
like no it's not the end of netflix

210
00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:23.760
it's that
the industry has changed

211
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.639
it is no longer
you know netflix amazon and disney for a

212
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:32.639
long time it was just netflix
yeah and you know

213
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:37.920
now there are so many streaming services
that

214
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.880
it becomes untenable for most people
under the average income to pay for all

215
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.839
of them yeah and so like just going off
of that and talking about like the

216
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:50.399
future of streaming services i don't
understand why each studio network maine

217
00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:55.040
and jerry and cletus
need their own streaming service i don't

218
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.480
understand why that's financially
feasible for them to invest that hbo for

219
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.079
instance had a terrible time rolling out
hbo go and hbo max which are different

220
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:07.680
hbo goes years and years ago okay so is
hbo max now hbo go

221
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.720
was just streaming
hbo content when you want to stream it

222
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.399
okay
hbo max is a whole is different from hbo

223
00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.760
hbo max has shows
like

224
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.600
our flag means death euphoria
no no fourier's on hbo jesus has shows

225
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.160
like um flag means death that are not on
hbo

226
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.279
but everything that's on hbo is on hbo
max

227
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:41.839
so you would think people would choose
hbo max over hbo yeah but

228
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.279
they're not
because

229
00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:49.120
i forget what it is i think it's like 70
million households are subscribed to hbo

230
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.160
via their cable package which means they
get hbo max for free

231
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.800
they get it for free but only about 40
million have signed up

232
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.480
so they're just happy with the hbo shows
that they're either happy for it or hbo

233
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.480
has not let them know yeah and you get
this for free hey like i said i was i

234
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.160
said i dropped hbo go i think it's
confusing obviously it's not great

235
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.560
market it's not great marketing no
because there was hbo go hbo now hbo

236
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.399
right um
i think canada had one of them i think

237
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:22.079
we had hbo now via hbo go i remember
okay

238
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:26.240
okay so now was the streaming service
yeah um

239
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.880
in the us where you could just stream
movies and stuff yeah um and now hbo max

240
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.560
has kind of taken over all of that we
don't have hbo and max in canada instead

241
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.320
crave has kind of because we've absorbed
everything that comes from hbo we have a

242
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.279
monopolistic um yeah we have like one
cable telecom provider

243
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:46.320
and um
there are some other cable companies but

244
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.079
bell is basically the the monopoly yeah
um like hbo is only available through

245
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:56.079
bell yeah and so right now like you know
like because everyone needs to have

246
00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:59.040
their own streaming services they're
cutting into the profits they have like

247
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.519
you could have like you know um you
could have hbo having a streaming

248
00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:07.520
division a streaming producer production
company that produces stuff for content

249
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.520
that then ships off to netflix i don't
understand why they

250
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.520
they they want to get rid of these they
saw the money yeah they saw the money

251
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.439
that was coming in to netflix and they
were like

252
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:23.280
we want a piece of that because netflix
is just paying us a licensing fee to

253
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.120
have
um

254
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.120
big bang theory yeah and
why don't we just put big bang theory

255
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.320
why don't we start our own stream
because like things like peacock which

256
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.840
is nbc cbs all access they're like we
literally have decades

257
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.280
of content
that we can put up instantly so like oh

258
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.520
you want to watch murder she wrote here
you go merch marketer brain why what was

259
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.039
going on in the
sort of like marketing focus group room

260
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:51.600
when they kind of made that decision
instead of realizing that there was no

261
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.440
marketing focus group okay it was simply
a dis an executive dis level decision

262
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.880
of
we have these decades of content that we

263
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.039
can put up immediately you know oh you
want to watch the golden girls or you

264
00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:12.559
know cheers or cosby or whatever
maybe not cosby

265
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:18.240
it's there immediately for you to watch
like on nbc or cbs or whatever yeah um

266
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.520
or with abc with disney but
they

267
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.799
and so they're like why don't we just
start our own streaming services and

268
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:28.559
then
the numbers will be coming to us for you

269
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:32.960
know streaming friends and seinfeld and
stuff like that instead of people

270
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.240
subscribing and paying netflix and
netflix is making more money off of

271
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.000
you know
friends than they paid to license it

272
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.039
which is like well that's how business
works you need to make a profit off of

273
00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:49.280
things um
and so they all decided almost at the

274
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.600
same time oh yeah it was ridiculous we
all have to stop renewing our netflix

275
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.039
licenses yeah
and so like did no one really like kind

276
00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:00.000
of read the room and sort of see like
you know like if we all have this for

277
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.960
the same price people don't have the
money that's not that's not financially

278
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.080
tenable like because now instead of
instead of making money they were making

279
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.640
off of licenses they're not making any
money they're not going to make it they

280
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.799
are they're making money they they all
have subscribers because the way they

281
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:16.880
looked at it
here's the thing

282
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.600
hbo

283
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.160
uh cbs all access peacock
abc via disney plus

284
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.520
um all of these companies
they are cable companies yeah they

285
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.400
have
monthly subscribers via cable yeah

286
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.480
um
and so they have a old-school mindset

287
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.840
netflix
created the streaming video

288
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.480
yeah like streaming movies and stuff
like that arena and so they have more of

289
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.000
a modern mindset of that so these people
were like they didn't think oh well will

290
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.600
they sign up for all of these streaming
services because they're like oh it's

291
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.440
like cable of course they will
and but it's not like cable because

292
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.320
cable is a matter of like appointment
television where streaming is more a

293
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.799
matter of convenience like what's on
netflix what's available what can i

294
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.600
watch like well yeah especially because
not everything is available in every

295
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.679
country netflix is literally different
in every country yeah um

296
00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:21.679
but
so they kind of looked at it as

297
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:25.360
they they will because they want to
watch the shows and they have this cable

298
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.679
mindset whereas netflix was very much we
need to get you here

299
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:32.159
because
it's not

300
00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:35.679
like just innate that you will be here
yeah and so that's why netflix has

301
00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:38.720
started doing original content like
orange is the new black and house of

302
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.919
cards and stuff like that
um

303
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:48.320
and so it was it's
it it's two very different mindsets and

304
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.919
you know there's already been talk of
companies popping up that will aggregate

305
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.480
all of them together so you can get a
package bundle with multiple streaming

306
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.280
services
available for you know

307
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.039
under one charge yeah you know that one
charge might be hundred bucks a month

308
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:08.559
but you'll get your act but you'll get
to choose like five of them yeah and

309
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.760
it's like
that's cable that's cable that's okay

310
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.960
that's cable but on through a computer
yeah

311
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.480
and then once again we're back at the
problem that arose out of the need for

312
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.520
netflix in the first place even though
netflix was originally a

313
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.440
competitor to the video rental like
blockbuster well yeah but then they put

314
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.360
blockbuster out of business because
blockbuster refused to adapt now is

315
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.240
netflix
are these kind of things for netflix are

316
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.000
they appropriate adaptations and i don't
i don't really think they are

317
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.440
because they're what do you mean what
kind of things uh the netflix's plans to

318
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.440
sort of uh fix things you know like
making making it difficult to share

319
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.559
accounts
uh oh no i think making it i think

320
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:51.200
increase the worst thing you want to do
when your

321
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.360
business model is keeping people
subscribed to you

322
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.960
is making things inconvenient yeah and
like that's kind of what i was picking

323
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.840
out because like netflix was picked
because it was convenient over

324
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.640
blockbuster you didn't have to go out
you didn't have to get a video delivered

325
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.600
you didn't have to give anything back it
was like you you have monthly monthly

326
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.960
subscription
and well netflix originally was a video

327
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.080
mail system yeah yeah
but it was you know you don't need to

328
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.159
drive to blockbuster yeah stuff like
that it will be delivered to you and so

329
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:22.080
it was more convenient than blockbuster
so it beat it and then netflix was

330
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.919
starting to beat cable
for viewership and that's when all of

331
00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:30.080
cable went well we want to do netflix
um but if everyone does netflix and no

332
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.880
one does netflix that's the thing like
you know like this isn't a matter of you

333
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.640
know like but people won't i don't think
people will ever go for like a bundled

334
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.360
uh streaming package i don't think
that's oh they will but here's the thing

335
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.880
they said we want to be netflix and it
was fine having multiple streaming

336
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.320
services is fine because churn is
something that's easy okay disney plus

337
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.760
this month then i'll cancel it i'll go
over to hbo and then i'll cancel it then

338
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.880
i'll go to peacock et cetera et cetera
um

339
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.039
it's the fact that netflix never took
churn into account

340
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:06.000
and now
because netflix went into so much debt

341
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.120
yeah to create as much content as
possible because they lost all their

342
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.400
licensed content
now

343
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.400
they
are like oh we need to up it's the price

344
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.039
increases that are driving people away
people for netflix

345
00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:24.559
or for people netflix was just the
default yeah like that was just a

346
00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.840
rollover they never thought of netflix
it became the generic term for a

347
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.600
streaming service like you know like
yeah like q-tip or

348
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.280
netflix yeah um
and so it was never like a big

349
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.640
like they never really had huge
cancellations because people

350
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.480
they would turn through the other ones
but for netflix it was just it was

351
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.080
always stable there was a regular sort
of array of content like it was

352
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.000
predictable you knew it was there and
the thing is the executives of netflix

353
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.400
making the argument
not making the argument of we increased

354
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.440
prices too much
because there is a ceiling of where

355
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.240
people will accept a price increase yeah
this goes for absolutely everything from

356
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.360
from toilet paper to streaming services
when you reach a certain dollar amount

357
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.559
not toilet paper because that's a
necessity but anything that isn't a

358
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:18.080
necessity when you reach a certain
dollar amount people will stop paying

359
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.000
for it so then you need to pull back
and you know say okay we need to lower

360
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.240
the price of x
and then you lower it and lower it until

361
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.520
people come back and then you say okay
that's the price the market will support

362
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.080
yeah and netflix
didn't do that well they kept pushing

363
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.840
and seeing okay how far can we go
but now they're not saying okay let's

364
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.640
pull the price back
because

365
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.799
when they because if they say we'll pull
the price back investors will get angry

366
00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:51.360
but investors already are angry because
people because subscribers are leaving

367
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.159
yeah and it's like what will cost you
more

368
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.880
you know
subscribers subscriptions being three

369
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.520
dollars cheaper per month or losing 200
000 people in a month so is is this the

370
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.720
same is this being hit i know there are
two executives main executives at

371
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.279
netflix uh do we know who is basically
calling our shots here and follow-up

372
00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:12.799
question is it the one who handled the
david chappelle debacle

373
00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:16.799
dave chappelle
i said david yeah dave chappelle um

374
00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.840
probably he is
the

375
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.200
there's there's
the two executives are netflix one of

376
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.159
them basically runs the business side
one runs the creative so this is the

377
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:28.799
business side this is all the business
side

378
00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:32.400
um
and so it would be his decision i forget

379
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.799
his name he looks like an [ __ ] he
does yeah he just looks like one of

380
00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:39.279
those
people and the other one likes to stay

381
00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:43.679
out of the out of photo photographs well
yeah because they're the one who goes

382
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:47.440
around and makes the deal with talent
and stuff like that and screen lights

383
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.840
projects and is schmoozing with you know
oscar voters and stuff like that and

384
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.400
so i don't even know who they are but i
know they exist

385
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.440
um
and so no this is

386
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.279
that executive the one who came out and
was like oh we love dave chappelle he

387
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:06.960
makes us money
we're gonna give him more money yeah

388
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.320
like especially like this is interesting
like you know the netflix drop base like

389
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.120
the price hikes in light of dave
chappelle's um you know 11 10 million

390
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.559
dollar
deal like for a comedy special like well

391
00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.919
yeah i mean like no one's really talking
about that because i don't

392
00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:25.679
because that's one
well that's one deal what else is are

393
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:29.600
they like just completely overspending
on cause like 10 million dollars for

394
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.039
a lot yeah yeah 10 million and that's
what that was a rhetorical question 10

395
00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:36.159
million dollars for just a comment but
they have told it's ridiculous why do

396
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:40.000
they have to they have to because
netflix does not want to publicly

397
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.760
release their numbers
they don't want to publicly release and

398
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.919
say
this

399
00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:49.440
until very recently they haven't even
released any kind of ratings

400
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.960
um
i think it's like how many hours watched

401
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.600
or something like that but not
necessarily how many people

402
00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.080
um
they haven't wanted to say like yeah

403
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.640
that was the whole thing about netflix
is they didn't really release ratings

404
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.240
they didn't really release or anything
so you never knew what was a success or

405
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.039
what was the failure yeah um
investors got um subscribers and that

406
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:13.919
was about it yeah
and

407
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:17.679
so because of that
they could because they didn't want to

408
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:21.919
release those numbers you couldn't have
royalty checks

409
00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:26.399
because otherwise you would have to make
those numbers public and so in lieu of

410
00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:32.240
having loyalty checks they just paid
everyone upfront a [ __ ] ton of money

411
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.440
and sometimes they would pay ridiculous
amounts of money for things that know

412
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.760
what other studio would do like the
irishman the martin scorsese movie every

413
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.200
other studio was like this is too
expensive there is no audience the

414
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.640
audience for this is not large enough
we're not paying 100 million dollars for

415
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.399
this and netflix was like we will like
you know there there was that joke of

416
00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:53.520
hello it's netflix you're you're
approved like hello thank you for

417
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.320
calling netflix you've been approved
yeah like you've been approved for 13

418
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.440
episodes that's that's that was the joke
for the longest time

419
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.360
um
and now

420
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.039
those chickens are kind of coming home
to roost

421
00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:09.279
and

422
00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:13.440
it sucks
because

423
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.440
netflix

424
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.840
has kind of become known as
the home of

425
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.679
queer content
yeah um

426
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:30.399
and it's like
is that going to be cut

427
00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:33.760
is kind of where my brain might be
because i'm like that's an easy thing to

428
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.320
cut
that

429
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.240
you know
the your investors aren't going to care

430
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.440
that much yeah um

431
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:48.720
like i don't think it will because a lot
of their queer content is incredibly

432
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.919
popular but you know you also never
really know especially like you know

433
00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:55.440
like what is going to be the decision
about what kind of content is going to

434
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.520
well i think there would be too much
backlash oh yeah like

435
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.799
especially when gay people talking about
queer content on netflix is basically

436
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:06.960
what netflix has in terms of goodwill in
the public yeah like there there's

437
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.120
already a huge amount of backlash to hbo
max for not

438
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.279
renewing our flag means death yet yeah
and because it's hugely popular and

439
00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:18.080
everyone knows it's hugely but that's
the thing like people this this isn't

440
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.480
the first time this has happened and
that's why people are anxious about our

441
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.799
flag means death is because they've seen
really good very well received queer

442
00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:29.440
content happen and get thrown into the
world and then just get ignored by the

443
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.919
the parent studio uh like what
well our flag means death first of all

444
00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:38.000
well no that hasn't been approved yet
but um

445
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.760
oh god you put me on the spot and i
can't think of anything now uh

446
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.840
yeah because i can't think of any like
anything that was like hugely

447
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.480
successful
that wasn't renewed

448
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.520
that was that was gay there was some
stuff that was like ridiculously

449
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.919
expensive
that was really successful that didn't

450
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:59.760
get renewed yeah because it was like
yeah it's successful but not successful

451
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.159
enough
uh like what was that jupiter

452
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.600
oh sensation jupiter jupiter's legacy
jupiter's legacy uh was hugely

453
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.440
successful it was number one for weeks
and weeks and weeks but they cancelled

454
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.960
it it was a superhero show okay but they
canceled it because although it was

455
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.080
number one it wasn't bringing in the
ratings that it needed well yeah and i

456
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.840
mentioned sense8 that was another thing
that just got not successful no sensei

457
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.679
did not have good ratings sense8 had a
very dedicated

458
00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:31.279
small following yeah
um

459
00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:34.159
whereas
you know our flag means death isn't

460
00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:39.760
netflix but our flag means death has a
huge fan base

461
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.360
as because you see the people talking
about it and it's people in their 60s

462
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.200
it's teenagers it's everyone in between
yeah yeah and so it's like it has a huge

463
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.320
following what there wasn't there when
when you when we put out the video about

464
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.960
it there were a bunch of people in the
comments that said they hadn't turned to

465
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.440
the show well yeah because they're not
on the internet okay so like that so

466
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.320
it's i guess you know if you're not on
the internet you wouldn't get a lot of

467
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.120
streaming content projected at you
because that's kind of where streaming

468
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.080
exists well yeah especially like and
here's the other thing here's another

469
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.919
big criticism of netflix from me
you know me coming from a marketing

470
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:16.840
kind of mindset
they don't

471
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.720
advertise you never ever see an ad for
the new season of the witcher is coming

472
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.279
out this weekend yeah that could never
be

473
00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:28.399
like we were both excited for like two
weeks but like even when the witcher was

474
00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:32.080
coming out the first season they never
advertised it yeah they they do do a lot

475
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.200
of relying on word of mouth and stuff
and hope that everything's going through

476
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.480
like new for um
articles and stuff like that and when

477
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.679
you get on netflix sometimes there'll be
promotion on the home page

478
00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:46.080
but that's it nothing they don't do any
advertising to bring you to netflix

479
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.360
which i think is what they need to
change because there are a lot of shows

480
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.760
that they pump a lot of money into
that just die on the vine

481
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.679
um
like russian doll season two season one

482
00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:01.440
was hugely successful they did nothing
to advertise season two remember when

483
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:06.080
they released set pictures um of season
two before trailer and everyone's like

484
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.960
okay where trailer um and then they got
the meme of like trailers what a concept

485
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.799
yeah
so yeah netflix like um but is this all

486
00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:17.679
gonna is this gonna ripple out into
other streaming services

487
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:20.640
no
the other streaming services

488
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.399
are still building their audience
unless it comes down that all the

489
00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:30.880
streaming services lost subscribers
um in which case it does become a

490
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:36.640
a situation of there are too many of you
some of you need to join forces and make

491
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.640
like
together some of you need to cancel your

492
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.080
[ __ ] and make a deal with netflix or
something

493
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.120
or you're gonna have to deal with less
subscribers because there are too many

494
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.960
of you yeah honestly like there is a
dizzying amount of streaming services

495
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.399
and i was thinking it was dizzy when
there were like four of them uh well i

496
00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:58.240
remember people saying there's there's
getting to be too many when there was

497
00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.399
just netflix
hulu amazon prime and then disney plus

498
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:06.000
entered the arena yeah and people were
like there's getting to be too many yeah

499
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.360
like disney's probably safe because it's
got the disney backlog but you know

500
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.679
number five that's too many but even and
since then there's been peacock hbo max

501
00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:18.000
cbs all access
and the thing is all of them seem to

502
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.519
have something worth signing up for hbo
max has a lot of interesting stuff like

503
00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:29.279
for instance hbo max um
the batman goes to hbo max i think like

504
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:31.760
two months before it comes out on
blu-ray

505
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.640
um
uh any warner brothers movie 45 days

506
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.559
after it enters theaters goes to hbo max
so like they kind of have that

507
00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:47.360
going for them um
they also have

508
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.360
so hbo max has some really good shows
they have um

509
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.120
flight attendant
our flags mean death our flag means

510
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.679
death
um

511
00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:00.640
uh
uh oh god what was that show i was just

512
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.120
watching it
um minx minx links was [ __ ] fabulous

513
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.639
i love that and you're really upset that
you never really got you know advertised

514
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.320
just outward because like i have not
come across anyone talking about that

515
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.960
show and it's like are people shy
because it shows dicks

516
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.280
in your room like it's a hilarious show
it's incredibly well made the actoring

517
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.399
is fantastic and
yeah it shows boobs and tits and dick it

518
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:31.200
shows dick a lot of dick hard dick hard
deck hard day i might watch it like

519
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.679
really hard making up for game of
thrones then yeah

520
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.280
and it's not like a flash it's like no
it's there like the center of the screen

521
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.639
oh wow um
like there's there's one episode where

522
00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:47.119
they're they're doing a new cover and
it's like um they're remaking it's the

523
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:51.440
modern david so it's like it's a guy and
he's posed like

524
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.440
uh michelangelo's david yeah but his
dick is huge

525
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.200
and they're like
this is kind of obscene the real one is

526
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.320
so small and eventually they get him in
a pose where it's like his dick isn't

527
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.839
showing
but it's like it was such a good show

528
00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:10.880
and so funny and so prescient
talking about like

529
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.359
how feminism at the time was like no
feminism is for women i don't know why

530
00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:18.960
you want to have a magazine with dicks
in it women don't like that but then it

531
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.440
shows it you know it becomes a real news
to me it becomes a really popular

532
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.079
magazine um
and so you know it it's and there's gay

533
00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:31.280
characters on there and there's all
sorts of different female characters you

534
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.040
know like ancient societal belief that
women just don't like sex

535
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.160
oh it's like yeah they don't like it the
way straight men do that like i remember

536
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.599
like see like it being a big deal and
like sort of like seeing movies and tv

537
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.520
shows like kind of openly talk about
like women who enjoy their sex life i'm

538
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.599
like and i was like you mean that's not
a thing like women are just like yeah if

539
00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:53.599
all straight sex is you know just
missionary he humps five times and then

540
00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:57.440
has a shower oh my god have you ever
read any like um

541
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.119
uh women's puberty manuals from like the
50s and 40s oh

542
00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:05.760
they are like that it's sort of anything
it's women it's less about like it's

543
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.680
literally like almost nothing the one
that i read through was like literally

544
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.200
nothing about like actual puberty very
little about xp really nothing about

545
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.800
menstruation nothing about you know like
hygiene a lot of it was like um

546
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.520
instruction manuals okay make sure that
you are in bed before him and in bed uh

547
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.040
no he needs to be in bed first and you
need to be out of bed first

548
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.200
um so that by the time he wakes up you
can have his toast and coffee ready

549
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.079
um
uh and then like the section on

550
00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:39.040
lovemaking was like um make sure to lie
on your back lie still

551
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.400
um
basically kind of says do what he wants

552
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.680
in like you know fancy terms but says
like when

553
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.800
while he is lovemaking
make sure to make his little noises

554
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.520
possible perhaps at climax make a brief
moan but that should be sufficient and

555
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.000
like it is so clinical it is so
ridiculous like

556
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.920
painful it was so painful it was if it
wasn't reality it would be hilarious it

557
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.599
literally felt like satire
but anyway yeah like hbo max has these

558
00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:13.920
great shows and
cbs all access has picard which star

559
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.640
trek fans will love
um

560
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.520
and it also has uh lower decks which
some star trek fans don't love because

561
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.480
it has like sex involved in it like a
lot of them are it's an animated show oh

562
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.680
right
and you know other but other ones are

563
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.680
like this is hilarious and fantastic
there's a there's a grizzly cat the

564
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.440
doctor is a
catwoman um i've seen trans people gonna

565
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.119
go nuts over because she's just really
grumpy she's like an old old she's like

566
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:45.359
old and wizard cat and like
but like all of the streaming services

567
00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:50.400
have something worth watching
and so it makes sense that people will

568
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.079
but the thing is they it's not constant
content

569
00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:58.320
uh like netflix is yeah and so people
you know they churn them they go through

570
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.599
them they're like okay you know this
month next month next remember disney

571
00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:04.880
plus was infamously bad for that when it
started out especially because it

572
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.480
cancelled a few things up front that it
had it for it had for it slate and had

573
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.359
these sections where nothing new was
coming out well yeah because it was

574
00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:15.119
shifting things like it was like oh
actually love victor's gonna go on hulu

575
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:18.480
instead the hillary duff show is just
got cancelled just got canceled lizzie

576
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.200
mcguire the lizzie mcguire uh yeah adult
show just got kicked there were some

577
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.520
other ones that just got cancelled out
right

578
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.200
and it's like because of creative
differences like this is not the time

579
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.560
for you to kind of have these problems
when you want to launch this thing you

580
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.320
need to hit the ground running i mean
disney plus had the backup of decades

581
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.240
and decades of
back material but honestly it was the

582
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.359
symptoms simpsons that pulled it through
sometimes was the most watched on disney

583
00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:45.440
blast for forever
yeah it's only recently that disney plus

584
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.280
original content is actually getting to
the top there yeah and it's usually a

585
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.760
movie that they didn't put out in
theaters yeah um but you know they could

586
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.839
do picks or a solid and pat them on the
back maybe but give them some bonuses or

587
00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:01.680
something yeah but uh [ __ ] disney [ __ ]
disney

588
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.680
but yeah it's so it's it's a little
frustrating kind of seeing

589
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.760
because it's frustrating from like a few
different angles because the industry

590
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.800
is not handling this well netflix isn't
really responding great they're just

591
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.960
kind of they're not lowering prices
they're punishing their users basically

592
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.000
because that's like verboten in the in
the business industry is you sh you can

593
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.040
raise prices but you can't lower them
yeah because lowering them makes it look

594
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.000
like you've failed yeah and so
especially the way around that is kind

595
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.680
of like oh well this month we're putting
on a special deal

596
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:41.680
where if you sign up um for a year you
get the full amount like 20 off yeah

597
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.280
which netflix doesn't have
you can't sign up for netflix for a year

598
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.160
we were thinking about that the other
day actually yeah like so it would be

599
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.040
smart for netflix to have a yearly plan
that you know you save

600
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.400
two months off of or something like that
or you pay for 11 months

601
00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.400
and you get 12 or something like that
and

602
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.440
then
they like

603
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.160
you don't have churn because people
aren't going to churn year to year yeah

604
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.000
they'll churn month to month but not
year to year uh which is why disney plus

605
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.920
hasn't seen much churn lately because
they have the annual manuscript

606
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.280
annual manuscripts manuscripts and you
will subscribe it's also frustrating

607
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.800
because on the other side from like the
side of investors and you know even like

608
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.480
you know audience to an extent like
there's this very reactionary viewpoint

609
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.160
that you know like okay we've had a
little bit of a dip in numbers but like

610
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.880
we'll be okay and everyone's like no you
won't you're gonna die this is the end

611
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.400
forever well that's that's that's that's
my god the stock market me an anxiety um

612
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.640
that's the the journalists who are
trying to get people to click on their

613
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.480
their articles saying like you know is
this the death of netflix and then they

614
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.079
all come to the same conclusion no it's
not netflix is fine

615
00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:54.079
save to a quick yeah um
and

616
00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:58.319
you know that's their job to get clicks
and so they have to do the bull and some

617
00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:01.040
it's not even the writers who do that
it's the editors that put out the

618
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.680
[ __ ] headlines um
but it's it's

619
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.040
it's dis for me personally
it's disheartening to see

620
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.839
netflix take a dive
in subscribers right now

621
00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:20.400
literally just because heart stopper
just came out

622
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.400
and i'm like
okay luckily the dive happened before

623
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.480
that came out so they can't blame it on
that yeah um

624
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.460
but it's like will that give them reason
to be like

625
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.760
[Music]
you only hit number six on the on the

626
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.160
chart
so and that's what i mean like you know

627
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.760
like you know uh the queer audiences and
queer content has always been like the

628
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.040
punching bags of studios and networks
yeah it's the easiest thing to get rid

629
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.040
of because it's the smallest group of
people that will fight back well not

630
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.640
just that but it's also kind of there's
the cultural mindset is that you know

631
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.880
queerdom is still very fringe it's still
very new and there are people who will

632
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.040
be very you know put off by it so like
um

633
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.000
this is kind of always in like the
discussion about movie stuff is like is

634
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.599
this you know gay if is this two-second
gay reference going to be what tanks the

635
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:10.480
movie and you know like we talk about
you and i talk about this all the time

636
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.000
you know like if this movie doesn't do
well it'll be because the they'll blame

637
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.160
the queer stuff they'll blame yeah and i
mean that's that's like that happened

638
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.319
with a lot of people blamed eternals not
doing well on the gay character and it's

639
00:42:22.319 --> 00:42:25.599
like no eternals just wasn't that great
a movie

640
00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:29.280
uh it wasn't
mass audience safe

641
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.680
um
the new fantastic beasts movie horrible

642
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.079
and people are pissed off at jk rowling
for her [ __ ] but because dumbledore

643
00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:42.640
says he loved a guy twice for six months
warner brothers isn't but

644
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.240
um
people in the the media space are saying

645
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.560
like is it because of the gay stuff that
people didn't go see it and now doctor

646
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.160
strange and the multiverse of madness
has been banned in multiple countries

647
00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:00.000
because there is a gay moment which i'm
assuming is chavez's moms

648
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
um and so it's been banned in a bunch of
middle eastern countries likely will be

649
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.160
banned in china uh unless they cut out
that moment which they probably will but

650
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.599
i was also saying these two the other
day the lack of enthusiasm about this

651
00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:16.240
movie in general uh multiverse of
madness yeah but it could be like that's

652
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.720
what i mean is even if there is a lack
of

653
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.599
of excitement over it because i because
of you know any number of reasons yeah

654
00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:28.240
if it doesn't do
you know a billion dollars disney could

655
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.520
easily say
it's the gay thing yeah you know there

656
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.839
were lesbian moms in it
and because of that people didn't go see

657
00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:38.960
it and you know the golden rule of enter
of the entertainment industry is that

658
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.839
executives do not pay attention to
reasons why they don't have that level

659
00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:46.079
of media literacy they kind of resort to
the numbers game yeah um and so it

660
00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:50.720
doesn't matter what is different from
this than all the other ones the other

661
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.800
all the other first gay character
things well it's like you know the art

662
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.920
they can't even say oh different from
all the other marvel movies like what's

663
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.800
different about this one it's like and
that's not even really different because

664
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.440
you've had gay characters in other
marvel movies including the most

665
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.480
successful movie of all time
so

666
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.520
you know he's barely in it but you know
there is a gay character in there

667
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.560
um and but you know like it looks at the
thing like there's a there's a gay

668
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.280
character in here so that's there
instead of reading the context of like

669
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.200
you know like the oversaturation of
marvel the very competitive media space

670
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.640
right now um general kind of you know
fatigue around you know yeah with like

671
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.480
doctor strange in particular like you
said there's over saturation there's

672
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.119
been way too much marvel content in 2021
yeah um

673
00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:38.480
there hasn't been anything this year yet
not yet no moon night oh right moon

674
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.920
night but um but like yeah but like even
outside of that people

675
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.520
the people have lost there's too much
marvel and so people aren't excited

676
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.560
about it anymore yeah it's not it's not
an event anymore it's just like okay the

677
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.359
marvel of the marvel thing this week
like yeah

678
00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:57.839
and people are also very
hesitant about it because there there's

679
00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:00.720
a lot of people you included who have a
very

680
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.800
um
close

681
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.280
bond with the scarlet witch character
yeah and and they're kind of looking at

682
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.480
the
the tea leaves and being like

683
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.359
are you gonna do what i think you're
gonna do yeah yeah

684
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:16.000
and so like pre-sale numbers haven't
been great

685
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.280
like we have our tickets um
they're actually going to the first

686
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.200
showing for normal people
in north america

687
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.920
in imax
yeah because we're in a special time

688
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.119
zone yeah because we're in a special
like i'm not gonna lie i am a little

689
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:34.640
nervous but i think i'm at the point
where i have resolved that if it's

690
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.520
disappointing it's not going to be like
you know the end of the world because

691
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.920
well i i am basically i have decided
that i will watch spoiler reviews before

692
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.760
we see it even though it will ruin the
movie for me because what will ruin it

693
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.079
worse is if something i really don't
want to happen happens yeah and so i

694
00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:56.000
need to go in there with
okay what happens to wanda

695
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.599
if she ends it
alive as a villain

696
00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:03.520
okay
if she ends it dead

697
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.839
no but also just like i'm kind of over
the whole like wanda being a villain

698
00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:10.960
thing because like you know okay but
that's the thing if she ends the movie

699
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.400
on a villa as a villain
that means she's still alive to be

700
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.800
redeemed yeah and to go forward and
develop the character more

701
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.520
if she dies
it's just like

702
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.480
well i don't i don't think you killed
her as a villain i don't think that

703
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.000
she's gonna die but like the whole like
kind of villain route like okay so she

704
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.480
splits open the the multiverse so that
she can get some kids back um i don't

705
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.440
think that that's gonna happen that's
not like what's gonna go down because

706
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.079
like that doesn't really fit the
character that exists in the comments i

707
00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:45.760
don't think she splits it open i think
she is going to basically kidnap

708
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.400
chavez
to help her find a reality where the

709
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.520
kids are alive okay but like um we like
wanda becomes a villain because she does

710
00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.000
multiverse stuff but you know we just
had a spider-man movie where peter

711
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.079
parker rips open the multiverse because
he's inconvenienced and is never at once

712
00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:08.400
dr strange ripped it open
but he's the hero now

713
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.920
that's what i mean like you know you
have two men who did some serious

714
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.119
hardcore [ __ ] with the fabric of
reality because this one kid was

715
00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:20.400
slightly inconvenienced yeah yeah
they're there and they're fine now

716
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.280
they're they they're fine they were
never their heroic status was never once

717
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.800
called into question like you know like
whether these people are actually heroic

718
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.559
that was never once raised even though
there were ample opportunities for that

719
00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:36.720
to happen in that movie but that had you
know that that

720
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.520
but this is getting into a discussion
yeah that has sex like sexism and

721
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.119
misogyny that exists in like you know
like audiences and that'll happen at

722
00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:48.720
some point probably uh podcast podcast
broadcast um video

723
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.880
video
puck gay yeah whatever um but so like

724
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.800
there's a lot that is kind of hung up on
this especially because marvel is trying

725
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.000
to sort of but that that's that's
another thing uh and this is just

726
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.440
something that came to my brain what
so all of the streaming services now

727
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.280
are releasing weekly
yeah or they're releasing two episodes a

728
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.240
week like i think hbo max does two
episodes a week um

729
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.559
um but most of them do like three
episodes up front and then an episode a

730
00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:24.160
week whereas netflix still does the
friday the friday friday dump everything

731
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.400
comes out they experimented with uh
arcane three episodes at a time yeah

732
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:34.800
um
and i think netflix should maybe

733
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:41.440
if not i don't like the idea of weekly
television yeah you hate that but

734
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.800
they might need to
because

735
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.720
what kind of happens with netflix is
something will be super duper popular

736
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.240
splash and then vanish like and then
vanish

737
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.079
if it doesn't create memes it goes away
if it's not tiger king or the witcher it

738
00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:59.920
just but even then like you know the
meme edge kind of does last for about a

739
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.520
month but meanwhile you know like you
had disney plus going on with uh one

740
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.040
division california
soldier but just just think about one

741
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.599
division yeah
still today like you know people are

742
00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:13.200
still talking just in case the mondays
like you know well yeah and it's like

743
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.559
four eight weeks
every thurs every friday morning

744
00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:22.319
people watched one division yeah and so
for eight weeks people were talking

745
00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:27.440
about one division which was free
advertising for disney plus yeah netflix

746
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.000
doesn't have that
and i think netflix let netflix relies

747
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.920
on his brown power yeah like i think
netflix

748
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.200
maybe should do stuff like like with
heartstopper i think they could have

749
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.040
released
half one week and half the next week to

750
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.680
have a week of talk
or maybe they could have done because

751
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:50.000
like three episodes three episodes four
episodes suspensions between episodes

752
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.440
does a lot to kind of drive a lot of
public interest like kind of raising

753
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.640
questions about directions for
characters what's going to happen

754
00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.640
whereas like you know like when things
are released like all at once like we'll

755
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:06.800
use um russian doll season two as an
example uh if it's not coming out every

756
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.160
week if you miss it that first week
maybe you forget about it and i have

757
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.880
seen a lot of people commenting on my
heart stopper video saying oh my god i

758
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.440
watched the first two episodes it's so
cute i absolutely love it i can't wait

759
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.359
until i have time to watch more
which is like

760
00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:27.040
but will you find that time yeah will
you forget about it

761
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.359
whereas if it was coming out every week
even if it's two episodes a week

762
00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:34.400
then
it's only two episodes a week you can

763
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.920
find the time for that but can you find
the time to sit down for four hours do

764
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.760
people have time to binge content
anymore especially like i mean i do it's

765
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.839
my job well yeah yeah yeah uh but like
even love it

766
00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:49.119
what i do even the idea of like you know
like um people

767
00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:53.760
working for work invading home spaces uh
more and more with this working with as

768
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.720
they adapted to why they're working from
home or like pulling people back to the

769
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:02.559
office uh our work uh culture has
not gracefully adapted to the economy

770
00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:07.920
and it is manifesting very ugly
back to you know like regular kind of

771
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.680
back to normal apparently
uh sort of thinking even

772
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.760
and i think this is another instance of
the ways that um you know employers are

773
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.160
kind of taking advantage of a short
memory of worker base um i i i didn't

774
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.760
really work now well i don't i don't
work in an office now but i haven't

775
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.800
worked in an office for a very long time
maybe you should

776
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.480
is that a threat are you gonna fire me
no i was saying maybe i should get an

777
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.680
office and make you go to it every day
at 9 00 a.m and

778
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.319
clock in and

779
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.520
no
the crowd seems to think no that's what

780
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.960
we should do no i just wanted to press
the button because i wanted to cut you

781
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.599
off the way you cut me off uh
i don't i don't have my headphones on i

782
00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:53.440
can't hear what the music is still going
well there was a thing okay um

783
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.119
but um
you know like the way have

784
00:51:57.119 --> 00:52:00.480
employers since the end of the pandemic
and you know this is a question for

785
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.319
patrons i guess like have
employers taking advantage of a

786
00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:08.480
short-term memory loss and sort of
become more aggressive in terms of their

787
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.720
hours uh their workplace demands uh
because people don't seem as interested

788
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.839
in streaming as they did five years ago
you know that's enough interested in uh

789
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:21.040
binging that's another thing
well yeah because binging was very

790
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.800
standard well no it was it was very um
uh

791
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.040
uh

792
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.200
oh
word fail um novel

793
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.319
it was very novel that you got to watch
the whole thing all at once the whole

794
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:40.160
season of daredevil all at once the
whole season of of of grace and frankie

795
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.119
the whole season of orange is the new
black you didn't have to wait a week and

796
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:46.160
it was just go you could just watch the
whole thing you didn't have to wait to

797
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.800
see what happens with daenerys it was
just yeah done

798
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.599
um
which

799
00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:55.359
i loved because i i'm impatient i
[ __ ] hate waiting

800
00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:58.880
um
it's like you know we're recording this

801
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.760
on saturday night it's not going out
until

802
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.200
wednesday no sunday night sunday night
we're recording this sunday night but it

803
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.559
doesn't go out until tuesday morning and
i'm like what am i going to do for all

804
00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:11.359
day monday then
um

805
00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:13.599
so i'm like why shouldn't i put it out
on monday

806
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:16.800
why shouldn't i put it out um yeah you
you

807
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.640
you
why shouldn't i keep it

808
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.520
yes
but yeah what i was getting at was

809
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:28.920
that's a really good point is that
um

810
00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:32.400
has the novelty worn off

811
00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:39.040
for the last two years netflix has seen
exponential growth

812
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.480
because people had nothing to do but
watch netflix

813
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.680
even when they were working from home
they were sitting on their couch with

814
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.680
their laptop and tiger king was on yeah
like they always they had nothing to do

815
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.200
but put on netflix and so netflix had
more subscribers it was growing and

816
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.359
grown and grown and grown and grown now
netflix lost these i think it's 200 000

817
00:53:57.359 --> 00:54:01.040
it might be a different number but let's
say 200 000. maybe that's just the

818
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.800
maturation of netflix maybe they're the
200 000 that we're never going to stick

819
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.720
around after the pandemic now that
things are going back to normal they're

820
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.599
gone but maybe the number will solidify
at maybe a million less than what they

821
00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:18.240
had but it's still like a billion or
half a million peop half a billion

822
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.640
people yeah on netflix
but the problem is that is a bit of yeah

823
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.000
200 000 is a little bit of a you know
like a drop in the bucket to drop in the

824
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.599
bucket but the problem is american
capitalism is exponential growth forever

825
00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:34.800
or you have failed oh i'm triggered by
this that's something that bothers me

826
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.880
about stock market product not even
stock market practices stock market law

827
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.319
it is a
it is a publicly traded company's legal

828
00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:46.160
obligation to always make more money
make more money than before than the

829
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.119
year prior and like i don't understand
how that's possible because that's not

830
00:54:51.119 --> 00:54:54.559
that's driving society into a situation
like mcdonald's like you're going to hit

831
00:54:54.559 --> 00:54:57.359
a point where you're just not people
aren't going to be interested in eating

832
00:54:57.359 --> 00:55:01.280
more big macs than they already do yeah
like and it's like with disney at some

833
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.280
point so like the solution to that is
okay we'll raise prices yes and that's

834
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.000
what happens is that you know with with
the disney parks it used to be disney

835
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.160
world and disneyland disney world
specifically was set up

836
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.680
so that it wasn't exponentially
expensive

837
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.799
so that families from all across the
united states could come to florida and

838
00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:27.920
see mickey mouse
by the 90s it was

839
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.440
middle class families from all across
the united states could come to florida

840
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.280
and see mickey mouse by the time i was a
teenager it was

841
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.920
upper middle-class families and now with
that [ __ ] star wars hotel it's like

842
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.960
people with so much money that they can
burn it

843
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.920
uh can come stay at a windowless hotel
for three nights yeah and so like what

844
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.119
the problem with that too is that you're
going to get into it into a henry ford

845
00:55:51.119 --> 00:55:55.440
situation where
um you choose like okay do you make a

846
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.359
potentially just starting start
supporting hitler

847
00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:03.599
you you build your own commune you horse
forward still alive during hitler oh

848
00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:06.640
yeah yeah yeah okay you force your
workers to live there and you pay them

849
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.599
in food stamps that you they can buy
from henry ford uh food suppliers

850
00:56:11.599 --> 00:56:14.400
it's gonna say that's kind of what tyler
perry is doing but not what the food

851
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.760
stamps think oh yeah yeah like he has a
compound for his workers but that was to

852
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.799
protect yeah henry ford paid people in a
special henry ford currency that could

853
00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:27.359
be redeemed at henry ford owned um

854
00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.520
the report that is that is
where i grew up that's how it worked the

855
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:38.480
coal miners
lived in houses that was given to them

856
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.880
called company houses and they were
basically duplexes and they were given

857
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.359
to them uh they
quote unquote given to them by the

858
00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:51.599
mining company
uh by the mining corporation which then

859
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:55.440
came out of their paycheck
and they basically didn't really get a

860
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.520
paycheck because they were they they
shopped at the company store

861
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.799
and it was just you know
that's how it worked now this was like a

862
00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:08.400
century ago but that's how well was
henry ford yeah really but like so like

863
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:15.839
it's like how is that not communism
that's how the soviet union worked uh

864
00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:19.839
yeah like how is that not bad communism
because you were still dependent on a

865
00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:22.720
higher figure deciding who yeah it's
just not the state yeah it's a

866
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:27.040
corporation uh it's like walmart
it's like if you work at walmart you can

867
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.920
only afford to shop at walmart yeah
which

868
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.040
walmart doesn't even give a very good
discount none of those lower income

869
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.480
places don't give a very good discount
you know when i worked for tim hortons i

870
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.760
got 15
off of coffee

871
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.599
and ten percent off of select bakery
just cause i should say coffee for

872
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:46.720
[ __ ] free
like they dump half of it out half of

873
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.799
the time you're not wrong i know
literally like

874
00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:54.079
you just give get give give your like
you especially because you want them to

875
00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:57.839
be perky and peppy for customers give
them free coffee anyway

876
00:57:57.839 --> 00:58:02.480
i worked at walmart twice and it's a ten
percent discount

877
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:07.599
ten percent yes there was one pla i
worked at best uh future shop which was

878
00:58:07.599 --> 00:58:11.520
the canadian best buy before best buy
it's no longer boss anymore

879
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:15.520
they had a really good discount system
you got no discount off of things like

880
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.760
macbooks and stuff but anything in store
that there was a markup on you didn't

881
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.599
pay the markup oh nice yeah that was
that was their discount system so i got

882
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:29.440
a lot of i got a lot of i got a 400
sound bar for 60 bucks she's that's

883
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.079
that's also a hell of a markup
to the tv right now um

884
00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:38.960
uh for uh closed captioning james
pointed at the tv yeah

885
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.960
james points to television
um

886
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.880
i just verbally uh closed captions but
that sounds like

887
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.839
against the rules but anyway like yeah
how has helpful has our work culture

888
00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:55.680
changed uh since the end of the since
the quote end of the pandemic in a way

889
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.599
that doesn't really permit for as easy
of streaming of binging anymore do

890
00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:02.240
people just not have the time or energy
to binge anymore because people are

891
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.440
exhausted from i don't think it's time
or ener i don't think it's an energy

892
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.040
thing but i do think it's the time
because if you are going back to an

893
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.280
office if your employer has not
instituted you know

894
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.799
the
the thing that is smart and okay let's

895
00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:20.000
stop paying for this office that we
don't need because we've proven for two

896
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.440
years that people can work from home
and we don't have to pay light bills or

897
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.400
anything anymore and there's that means
we don't have to pay them more money but

898
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.440
we get more profit because we're not
paying rent anyway

899
00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.480
um
so if your employer

900
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:36.160
is making you go back to the office you
know that's travel time in the morning

901
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.119
travel time in the evening working
throughout the day

902
00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:42.079
i'm just thinking
like a lot of places i worked when i

903
00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:46.799
would be bored i would just put on
netflix but um no you know most offices

904
00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:50.319
have this like nazi-esque thing where
they monitor what you're doing on your

905
00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:55.359
computers and and it's like oh you have
facebook open close to facebook oh i

906
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:57.599
didn't even but when i was working at
all center i'd even bother touching

907
00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:01.200
facebook when i was on wikipedia
sometime like between like and

908
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.640
responding to emails sometimes a manager
would rock a walk over even for less

909
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.000
than like five minutes after an email i
would walk over and be like yeah you're

910
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.680
taking too much time for yourself i'm
like i'm literally swapping out tabs

911
01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.799
between this and wikipedia about i don't
know i think it was that was that was

912
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:17.920
when i was on my kung fu binge
uh kung fu spiral it's been a while

913
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.839
since i had a good like wikipedia spiral
uh but what i'm asking is like is there

914
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:24.480
something different now about our
welcome culture than it was before then

915
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.680
pandemic and sort of hear me out right
now so

916
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.799
uh people who haven't been working at
home we're talking about surface

917
01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:34.640
uh infamous example is wendy's and like
mass walkouts and people just stop

918
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.040
stopping doing work because so much work
was demanded of what employees remained

919
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.359
yeah uh like we were talking about like
60-hour 80-hour weeks

920
01:00:43.359 --> 01:00:47.119
um
have employers

921
01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:50.240
acclimated
to giving

922
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.960
fewer employees more responsibilities
like that and have employees acclimated

923
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.960
to doing that work and second of all so
like you know that would feed into a

924
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.359
lack of time and energy because like if
p if that still is the norm for i don't

925
01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:08.400
think so because what is what i'm
actually seeing is more people being

926
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.839
employed for less hours

927
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.880
so people just can't afford the
streaming services uh so it's not a

928
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.680
matter of not having the time as they
can afford it but also the second second

929
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.680
thing people who have been working from
home i saw a lot towards the within the

930
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.359
first to second year of the pandemic i
saw a lot of people

931
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:28.400
um
having very strong issues with their

932
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.079
employers for being very invasive with
their home life for instance you know

933
01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:36.960
hooking up their personal computers to
those observational services

934
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.599
reducing employee pay or reducing salary
because well you don't have to you don't

935
01:01:41.599 --> 01:01:43.839
have to travel and you don't have to
travel to the office you don't have to

936
01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:46.480
take lunch so we didn't need to pay you
as much and it's like that's not what

937
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.720
the arrangement was yeah but anyway so
going on so like um and not only that

938
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.720
but demanding more for employ from their
employees because without without

939
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.680
respecting our boundaries so it's like
okay you're working from home here's

940
01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.280
communication stuff i'm gonna get i can
get in touch with you literally

941
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.480
any one of the 24 hours well that's
literally how it is if you work salary

942
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.359
yeah it doesn't matter like if if you
work salary you're basically on call 24

943
01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:12.240
7.
which is a big a thing that a lot of

944
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.880
people are like oh my god i would love
salary because then you know you're

945
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.240
guaranteed a certain amount it's like
yeah but you're not guaranteed a certain

946
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.799
amount of hours yeah and even when you
interview for a salary position at least

947
01:02:22.799 --> 01:02:26.480
in my instances they have said like you
know sometimes you might have to work 50

948
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.400
or 60 hours a week but you know we'll
take that into account when you're when

949
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.119
like for you know if you need a day off
or anything like that um

950
01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:40.240
and in most cases i never worked 50 or
60 hours a week i worked my 35 hours

951
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.359
that was it but also folks make sure
that when you are going to situations

952
01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:46.480
for interviews that you do have
negotiating power if an employer wants

953
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.960
to hire you i mean a lot of people don't
have that

954
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.480
skill set no it's not a skill set it's
they don't have

955
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.240
negotiating power they need a job well
yeah yeah that's that yeah that's the

956
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.520
case but like
um if you do have leverage make sure you

957
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.640
you can get things worked into your
contract about your work um yeah like if

958
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.240
you have leverage yeah like absolutely
but i mean if you're just if you're

959
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.720
looking for a job you're
just kind of screwed you can't like i

960
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.480
have heard about people who have worked
in their contract that um they don't

961
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.880
they aren't responsible for their team's
duties they're responsible for their

962
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.160
duties
um so you know stuff like that

963
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.680
yeah
but this is an episode about streaming

964
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.000
services
talking about factors that may be

965
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.839
contributing to why people
would be moving away from you know like

966
01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:32.960
streaming services or why netflix would
suffer that bump or you know like what

967
01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.280
the future of streaming services could
be

968
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.799
well yeah and like i said i think this
the future of streaming

969
01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:42.880
really
should be

970
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.119
i i loathe saying this
the weekly model

971
01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:50.240
or even if it's you know dropping two
episodes

972
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.319
on friday instead of one episode first
releases to get things out faster

973
01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:57.280
because you have so much content you
need to get through

974
01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.160
um
like

975
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:07.200
and so especially for half hour shows
do two two episodes a week yeah um

976
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.440
because like
it just doesn't feel like that important

977
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.079
for a half hour show but like when minx
was coming out it wasn't i was a half

978
01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:19.920
hour show but i was getting an hour of
it and so i did sit down every thursday

979
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.440
and watch it um
and

980
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.839
so i think that's probably the future of
streaming is

981
01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:31.520
a more
uh drawn out release process because

982
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.680
then you can have
like okay this show comes out on monday

983
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.839
this show comes out on tuesday the show
comes out on wednesday instead of just

984
01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:44.079
we're dropping 40 different things on
friday and 39 of them are never going to

985
01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:47.920
be seen by anybody yeah that's that's
and that means 39 of them are not

986
01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.000
bringing in any any revenue that's 39
that's 39 of them that were overspent

987
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.359
and did not need to have money spent on
when you just needed that one yeah so

988
01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:57.920
like you know
talking about netflix wasting money so

989
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.079
like the question that i have here is
netflix is famous for sort of

990
01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:07.039
setting the capitalistic standard of
sitting back and crossing their arms and

991
01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:11.039
saying well uh blockbuster if you don't
like it you should have adapted yeah um

992
01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:14.960
so will they adapt yeah is that the
question netflix's business model has

993
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.359
succeeded off of this rampant wanton
overspending

994
01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:23.920
um and then kind of dropping everything
on one day and seeing what takes off and

995
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.920
you know kind of writing off what
doesn't um

996
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.440
is it going is it part of their business
model will they

997
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.119
to kind of not adapt is that the thing
like will they kind of be like no this

998
01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:38.079
is this is netflix netflix do what
netflix does if we were someone else i

999
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:41.200
mean they have been adapting from the
very beginning

1000
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.440
um
so that's why it's kind of weird seeing

1001
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.200
them kind of dig their heels in this
time and say like we're gonna change but

1002
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.920
the change is going to be anti-consumer
yes whereas usually their adaptations

1003
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.680
are going in the opposite direction and
i think it's because

1004
01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.880
they need they're like
going in a more anti-consumer direction

1005
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.920
because that's what their stockholders
want yes

1006
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.359
um
their stockholders want

1007
01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:14.079
because saying we're going to you know
get rid of screen sharing and we're

1008
01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:17.520
going to get rid of or account sharing
we're going to

1009
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.039
create new tiers is something that can
be done within a month

1010
01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:25.599
it's not long-term thinking yeah which
is what needs to be done to fix a

1011
01:06:25.599 --> 01:06:29.599
company apple was not saved by steve
jobs coming in and a month later they

1012
01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:34.160
had money it took years before steve
jobs came back in in the late 90s to

1013
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.160
when you know
the ipod became a thing yeah the ipod

1014
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.799
didn't come out when steve jobs joined
the company again yeah it's because

1015
01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:43.839
steve jobs needed time to work on the
technology to make sure that they were

1016
01:06:43.839 --> 01:06:48.000
releasing a product that was worth
releasing yeah like so it takes a while

1017
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.880
to get these things working i remember
when smartphones only did music and that

1018
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.839
was it
no they always had like internet i was

1019
01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:59.599
joking because like the ipods were
originally like smartphone sized and

1020
01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:03.520
vaguely smartphone shaped and kind of
yeah so like you know remember when

1021
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.000
smartphones only had music on them i
remember when jokes about the iphone it

1022
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.799
was
uh

1023
01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:14.799
an ipod but without the wheel it was
like a blackberry keyboard and it's like

1024
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:18.400
oh apple's going to release an iphone
and then they actually did it and it's

1025
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.480
like oh
well yeah because before that like i i

1026
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.520
thought that phone company a couple
companies did try and experiment with

1027
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.760
touch screens but they didn't get
yeah they didn't and the ones that there

1028
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.119
was one that didn't
use a stylus but they could they didn't

1029
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:37.280
work properly yeah because it was
pressure sensitive screens because it

1030
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.400
was like it was like those two layer
screens where you pressed it yes down

1031
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.200
and like on this like layer of plastic
yeah like they do on um

1032
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.520
ironically tim horton's tills the touch
screens on this one yeah gross uh bad

1033
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.520
memories okay no we're not going there
no nope and they might not do that

1034
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520
anymore
i mean when somebody's no they are

1035
01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.000
better at touch screens i'm in there
just getting flashbacks too oh there

1036
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.720
but yeah so it's what do you guys think
is the future of streaming

1037
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.400
uh
i funnily when when the the news hit

1038
01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.359
that netflix had lost 200 000
subscribers

1039
01:08:11.359 --> 01:08:15.839
nebula put out a tweet about how they
had gained x amount of subscribers and

1040
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:20.880
stuff like that i just got really
salty yeah i'm like

1041
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.839
yeah but netflix has a lot more gay
content than you do oh um shots are fire

1042
01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:30.239
shots were fired shots have been fired
shots are fired in

1043
01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:36.000
nebula and i am not defending
netflix because they've done some shitty

1044
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
[ __ ] with like dave chappelle and stuff
but you know they've also done some good

1045
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.679
stuff that other
companies didn't touch

1046
01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:46.799
and
so

1047
01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:49.600
yeah what do you guys think is the
future of streaming do you think it's

1048
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.640
going to go to a weekly model do you
think it's going to

1049
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.759
um that commercials via streaming are
going to be the way to go don't imagine

1050
01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:01.199
uh
if like i sometimes i don't even watch a

1051
01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:04.480
netflix uh youtube video because it has
an ad and i'm like screw this i'm not

1052
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.279
i'm not bothering i can't i can't be
bothered and also

1053
01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:14.159
horrible
that is how youtubers make money um

1054
01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:16.960
you know this is like music videos and
stuff

1055
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.440
that is how record labels make money off
of youtube they make money off of

1056
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.040
touring and concerts live performances
not the record labels

1057
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.759
um
[Music]

1058
01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:30.239
it's when it's like the double ad you
know

1059
01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:33.920
like there's two ads in a row
you one of them is usually only five

1060
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.080
seconds though yeah
um

1061
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.359
i feel bad now i'm sorry
for anyone who wants to make sure to

1062
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:46.080
support their their favorite youtube
creators watch the ads and turn off ad

1063
01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.480
blockers or just you know look check see
if they have a patreon

1064
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.280
or do that yeah but you know it also
helps to force youtube to pay them

1065
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.040
um
but uh

1066
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.400
what and what what streaming services
are do you guys

1067
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.000
like subscribe to which are are there
any that you're married to that you

1068
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
won't unsubscribe to
like i've been subscribed to netflix

1069
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.440
since 2013 and i haven't unsubscribed at
any point and every time i get an email

1070
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.719
that says like oh it's going up a dollar
i'm like that's fine whatever

1071
01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:23.920
um i just kind of brush it off because i
i use netflix a lot

1072
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.040
um
but like if you if netflix had ads like

1073
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.760
you know you're you're gonna be there
falling asleep to grace and frankie and

1074
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.280
then between i would not be honest
that's what i mean yeah the ad tier is

1075
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.440
is like 5.99 yeah i'll pay the 20 bucks
so i don't have to deal with that [ __ ]

1076
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.320
um so i mean like that'd be so
disruptive like you know like getting

1077
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.600
into a vibe and like kind of chilling
out and then all of a sudden blasting

1078
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.040
loud commercial like especially if they
had the the

1079
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.960
stuff the cable does where you do where
commercials and tv shows are louder well

1080
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.640
it's not because it's not the
commercials are louder it's that

1081
01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.239
networks don't have
um standards saying that

1082

decibel

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.880
commercials are
can be produced much louder than tv

1085
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.960
shows because commercials are usually
produced on the cheap whereas tv shows

1086
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.320
have sound mixers yeah and so okay
