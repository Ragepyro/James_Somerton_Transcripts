1
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.480
as diversity becomes more and more of a
sticking point in our social landscape

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.219
discourse around representation follows
close behind there is a precedent for

3
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
developing an incorrect narrative around
romanticized historical events

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
presenting sentiments that simply don't
represent a community as a whole and

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.779
struggling to actively showcase visible
representation or understand what

6
00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.540
qualifies as visible representation and
of course when you do get representation

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.079
right you actually have to go to the
right lengths

8
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
to promote it just like you would any
other property but that said it's not

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
like good representation doesn't exist
usually when the people who are being

10
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.539
represented get to make their own stuff
it tends to be well received sometimes

11
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.940
not whether I agree with the response or
not but usually if you exist within the

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
queer Community you generally have a
better understanding of how to Showcase

13
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.939
these people what matters to them what
their values are and what you can even

14
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.659
make fun of
without insulting everyone and believe

15
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.860
me the queer Community has a heap of
that for instance trans men and envies

16
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
for some reason really like rats like
pet rats a lot of them feel this way and

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
nobody knows why though for people who
are not queer themselves but who do want

18
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.100
to create queer characters there are a
range of challenges that they face such

19
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.700
as limited perspective straight writers
by virtue of their own sexual

20
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
orientation likely don't have first-hand
experience with the unique challenges

21
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.020
emotions and nuances that queer
individuals face and cultural

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
sensitivity and accuracy straight
writers might lack this cultural

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.020
sensitivity leading to
misrepresentations or inaccurate

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040
depictions that fail to capture the
essence of queer lives the potential for

25
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.720
unintentional insensitivity can arise
from a lack of research or an

26
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.380
over-reliance on current mainstream
media representations there's also the

27
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.420
fear of offending this fear may lead
them to tiptoe around important issues

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.380
or sanitize the experience of queer
characters resulting in narratives that

29
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.599
lack depth and emotional resonance and
there's stereotyping and tokenism when

30
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.260
queer characters are reduced to being
nothing but their sexual orientation or

31
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.180
gender identity becoming defined solely
by this one part of themselves rather

32
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
than their personalities aspirations and
complexities and this is perhaps true of

33
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.680
all categories of diverse characters
however there is a recent Buzz around

34
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
queerness both from consumers and
producers and through this Buzz we've

35
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.959
seen the good
the Bad and the Ugly and while queer

36
00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.040
creators are finally getting a chance to
tell their own stories straight creators

37
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.420
can struggle to deliver these same
messages

38
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.040
though that being said
why is Neil Gaiman so good at it

39
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.599
Neil Gaiman typifies a sort of literary
polymorph where in spite of his cultural

40
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.920
impact he has written or contributed to
a total of only 11 novels however

41
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.099
factoring in his work and screenplays
teleplays Comics children's books and

42
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.840
non-fiction Gaiman has a considerable
library of work including the creation

43
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.379
of a certain dark-haired magical boy
with an owl familiar which was

44
00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.459
suspiciously published through DC Comics
seven years prior to Harry Potter

45
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.040
hitting the shelves
must be magic granted I say only 11

46
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
novels as if even that isn't impressive
whereas once it was not considered out

47
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.720
of the ordinary to be invited into
literary canon with far less than 11

48
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.560
published works that's usually not
possible today unless of course one

49
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.400
comes from money or is the one new
author of a decade that the publishing

50
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.060
industry has decided to Rally behind but
especially as far as high profile

51
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.560
writers go Gaiman has peppered his
library of works with a broad range of

52
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.760
diverse characters representing a myriad
of Life Experiences similar to the

53
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.239
forced wokeness accusations that were
hurled at the rings of power which

54
00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.379
focused more on gender and race than the
broad changes to the characters in

55
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.400
mythology the Netflix adaptation of
gaiman's iconic Sandman series was given

56
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.420
the same criticism from the predictable
kinds of people the displeasure at

57
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.799
seeing queer experiences on the screen
clearly indicated that these particular

58
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.160
critics
hadn't read The Source material maybe

59
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.299
they just looked at the pictures
gaiman's Renown as a writer truly began

60
00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.860
in 1990 when he co-authored good Omens
with literary giant Terry Pratchett

61
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.280
according to Legend Neil pitched the
idea to Pratchett offhand at a

62
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.000
convention to which Pratchett seemed
agreeable though Neil assumed that he

63
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.479
was just being let down gently and put
it out of his mind sometime later Neil

64
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.020
got a phone call from Pratchett who
wanted to know how this misplaced

65
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.220
Antichrist idea might play out insofar
as the authors developed this Cosmos

66
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
neither angels nor demons have sex
organs nor do they actively seek out

67
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.080
sexual intercourse and by all accounts
gender is more or less described based

68
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.060
on how an observer might categorize them
regardless even of that this he they

69
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.900
angel demon Duo are so incredibly
married it was basically a joke even at

70
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.620
the time of good omen's publication
while many fans of the show and even of

71
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.620
the book were quick to describe a
xerophail which is a fictional name

72
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.180
approved by spellcheck believe it or not
and Crowley as a gay couple it was

73
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.780
indeed exasperated by gaiman's
description of the tale Trail as a love

74
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.800
story and yet both God the narrator of
the story and Gaiman are hesitant to use

75
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.240
the term gay to describe them but unlike
your average Network Executive Press

76
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.380
Conference or corporate social media
account this explanation is queerer than

77
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.759
the typical just friends cop-out the
narrator describes that most people who

78
00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.380
encounter aziraphail May describe him as
quote gayer than a tree full of monkeys

79
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.220
on nitrous oxide but does not describe
his earphale as gay himself Gaiman

80
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.000
elaborated that the love story between
aziraphal and Crowley is not gay because

81
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.320
neither of them are men one is an Angel
and the other a demon neither of whom

82
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.220
are beings that have sex traits and any
ambiguity in the first story is

83
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.280
dismissed in the second you're a good
ladder not actually either this suggests

84
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.479
that any element of gender expression is
the result of self-identification or a

85
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.440
matter of how Others May observe them
furthermore the celestial beings seem to

86
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.699
refer to each other by they them from an
authorial standpoint this is a complex

87
00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.240
understanding of gender and sexuality
that is even a little bit theoretical

88
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.380
for many within the community itself if
there is no element of sex or gender

89
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.520
present in a romantic pairing how can we
describe the sexual orientation of the

90
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.240
couple the unfortunate thing about the
term homosexual is that it describes not

91
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.900
only the gender of the subject's
attraction but the gender of the subject

92
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.400
as well
homosexual same gender attraction you

93
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.300
need to have a gender to be attracted to
the same gender as the public begins to

94
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.380
understand and accept a separation of
sex and gender many of these sexual

95
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.699
labels fail to describe what they are
meant to an amab trans non-binary person

96
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.780
who's attracted to high feminine gender
traits among gay men

97
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.039
we don't have language to describe that
yet factor in that both aziraphale and

98
00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.100
Crowley have a very ambiguous set of
gendered mannerisms and expressions

99
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.800
Gaiman has stated that they don't really
know what gender is about but they do

100
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.220
their best to emulate it to their own
understanding humans are weird and

101
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.240
that's how it works I knew that
ironically this may actually be an

102
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.680
instance where homosexual actually would
apply but even that depends entirely on

103
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.020
if homosexual is compatible with asexual
homo romantic but again in terms of

104
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.800
gender non-conformity the gender of one
person is not relevant to describe the

105
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.280
attraction to another out of all the
psychological terminology that came out

106
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.020
of the 1800s that has become archaic why
are we still holding on to these terms

107
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.580
as if our personhood depends on them
don't answer that I I know why I've

108
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.419
tried to make that video like seven
times now you know I got like sevens

109
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:47.039
however instead of engaging in a debate
about how we identify Cosmic beings

110
00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.780
trying their best to humanely live their
best eternities Gaiman simply avoids the

111
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.780
discussion altogether not that he
excludes queerness from a reading of

112
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.259
these characters they're certainly not
straight but their place in queerness is

113
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:04.080
not worth categorizing Beyond
queer not even LGBT because they fit

114
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.740
none of those categories the first
season of good Omens was a show that had

115
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.880
a couple our angel and demon of some
Renown at the center of it though no

116
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.960
confirmation came in season one
anyone with a brain could see it and

117
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.160
season two
became a queer show in order to deter an

118
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.400
investigation from Heaven Crowley and
aziraphel need to Stage a love story

119
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.780
Maggie is a lonely record saleswoman who
has a strong crush on Nina the

120
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.919
overworked owner of a cafe Nina however
is already in a relationship we never

121
00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.880
meet her partner but through text
messages we have a clear indication that

122
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.300
not everything's coming up Rose is there
Nina's girlfriend is so intensely

123
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.219
jealous it likely crosses into emotional
abuse we aren't put on any kind of

124
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.180
pedestal here we have the same kind of
relationship problems that straight

125
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.279
people have however as much as Maggie is
Lovesick and Nina is stressed out over a

126
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:57.779
relationship that turns into a messy
breakup neither of them are defined by

127
00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:01.320
their attraction to the other their
personhood is primary over their

128
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.399
queerness and neither are justified by
romantic attractions Nina smartly

129
00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:09.480
decides that immediately after a breakup
is not a good time to get emotionally

130
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.320
invested with another woman
which is sound psychological advice

131
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.519
coming out of Fantastical queer fiction
good on you this is secondary only to

132
00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.120
the romance between aziraphale and
Crowley which is split up in the end

133
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.760
because the Damned Angel suddenly gets a
hard-on for a promotion you idiot

134
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.040
we could have been
us Damon has smaller roles for queerness

135
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.540
as well a sketchy Scotsman openly
professes that he uses his phone only

136
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.320
for Grindr and the owner of a magic shop
references an anniversary with his

137
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.800
partner who he brings to zero Fell
Street Business Association meeting

138
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.420
partner being an apt genderless
descriptor because his partner is

139
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.140
visibly androgynous in fact throughout
the season characters typically stick to

140
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.100
non-gender descriptions of relations and
individuals something that I imagined

141
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.360
most people wouldn't even notice unless
they have it pointed out to them and

142
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.300
considering that neither angels nor
demons have gender in the first place

143
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.279
the romance between bl's above and
Gabriel would be queer in spite of their

144
00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:13.680
actors genders as far as what I've read
of gaiman's works this seems to be by

145
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.880
far his queerist and while I'm not
complaining this level of brazen in your

146
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.550
face queerness is a little bit out of
character for him

147
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.940
[Music]
thank you

148
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.820
though he does his best to quietly
present visible queer identities without

149
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.820
making a big fuss about throwing in
Surprise lesbians he likes troubled

150
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.240
lesbians and people without genders one
of the greatest strengths of gaming as a

151
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.740
writer is his signature quiet Nuance in
prose even when he's conveying important

152
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.399
messaging or perhaps in regard to queer
representation he may not have realized

153
00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:48.959
just how important that was beginning in
Sandman there is of course desire in the

154
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:52.260
fictional world of Sandman in
conjunction with the actual deities of

155
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.579
our human history there exists seven
beings who represent Universal aspects

156
00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:59.940
of The Human Experience they are shape
shifters whose physical appearance

157
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.540
changes depending upon who is observing
them certainly makes it easy for artists

158
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.500
and casting directors functioning as a
family of siblings rather than a proper

159
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.060
Pantheon they are called the endless and
endless though they may be there is an

160
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.620
order to their births Destiny the eldest
predates the existence of all life and

161
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.579
functions as a constant for all things
in the universe in all Cosmic Realms

162
00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:24.959
people beings deities and celestial
bodies whereas the other endless except

163
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:28.560
for perhaps death have limitation on
their Authority death is the second

164
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.700
visually inspired by cinnamon Hadley
death existed the moment the first

165
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.779
living thing was born and will vanish
when the last living thing closes its

166
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.260
eyes makes sense as death represents the
cosmic determinism of all living things

167
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.399
in spite of her simple Gothic appearance
her manner is more akin to a death Doula

168
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:48.480
or palliative care nurse and while she
is a universal her only rule is that all

169
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.260
things end but can be flippant a bit
when that happens dream the central

170
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.279
figure of the Sandman series though not
always the protagonist was born next he

171
00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:59.700
represents higher thought processes that
living things experience mostly

172
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.779
imagination dreams domain seems to be
where reality and Imagination intersect

173
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.100
what from The Real World is brought into
his realm and how things from his realm

174
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.000
can become reality and how everyone is
 if he isn't running a tight ship

175
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.140
gods and other deities are suggested to
have derived from dream's realm or not

176
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.640
it's fairly vague probably deliberately
the next is referred to as the prodigal

177
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.839
who has been wandering for some time and
almost nobody knows where he is younger

178
00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:28.380
still are the twins desire being being
the secondary antagonist of the Netflix

179
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.880
series The behind the scenes string
puller of all things disturbing

180
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.140
desire was and has remained non-binary
though back in the day desire was

181
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.279
referred to as it rather than they them
in the Netflix series in a mythological

182
00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:45.420
and literary history of depicting the
personification of lust and sex as a

183
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.139
contemporarily beautiful woman this
speaks to a masculine-centric society

184
00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:53.399
where the only individuals for whom
desire matters is men to make desire

185
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:56.940
either or any gender would exclude the
people for whom that particular

186
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.360
expression of physical beauty is not the
object of desire there's also an

187
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.019
argument to be made that might suggest
that desires pronouns are better as it

188
00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:09.720
because desire and fetishization are
dehumanizing but desire the character is

189
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.139
also the personification of even
non-sexual desire if you want something

190
00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:19.320
or anything no matter how badly this is
desire's realm desire's twin is despair

191
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.339
kind of a younger twin is complicated
despair is the personification of

192
00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:27.839
exactly what she seems to be the gateway
to her realm is mirror and her sigil is

193
00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:32.279
a hook very fitting visual indicators
the youngest of the Endless is delirium

194
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:35.820
who was born Delight again it's
complicated and everyone in the family

195
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.420
respects both desires pronouns and
delirium's name change it's difficult to

196
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.079
say how faithful Sandman will remain to
its source material we only have one

197
00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.740
season adapted from two story arcs and a
large number of the comics are one-off

198
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.160
stories about humans who encounter the
endless though the streaming series was

199
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.060
exceptionally true to the comics
published three decades prior and I'm

200
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.380
sorry to you Neil if you're watching
this for my overuse of words and phrases

201
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.480
like years decades illustrious career
long ago inspiration for new generations

202
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.660
plural I don't really like thinking
about how long ago Jurassic Park was

203
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.200
released and
how I saw it in theaters

204
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.560
but it's important to recognize the
historical context for how these queer

205
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.820
ideas were being not only teased but
explored in intense taken for granted

206
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.360
ways at a time before the majority of
the viewer base of this video had even

207
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.260
been born sorry again Neil whereas today
we have an almost direct adaptation of

208
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.180
Sandman via streaming and it is decried
as pandering to wokeness whereas it's

209
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.779
basically just the same as it was in the
comics with just a bit more gay though

210
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:37.019
that said I have a feeling that Gaiman
was treating the Netflix adaptation as

211
00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:41.579
an opportunity to give Sandman a go over
and bring even more of his initial

212
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:45.779
Vision to life there is an expressed
comfort with casting black actors for

213
00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:49.860
roles that had been white in the comics
and with showcasing a deeper expression

214
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.079
of the queer experience sorry bro these
teeny tiny sunglasses stay on during sex

215
00:14:55.079 --> 00:15:00.079
and that's okay
I'm okay with that

216
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:04.320
honestly not so Ambiguously Camp men
wearing blackout sunglasses to conceal

217
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.100
weird eyes seems to be a fixation for
Gaiman and

218
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.420
ocular facsimiles in general it seems as
if all of the base content from the

219
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.540
first two arcs of Sandman made it into
the first season changes made to this

220
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.360
content were primarily a matter of
streamlining the existing information

221
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.959
pacing was smoothed out or characters
were altered or combined to fit into

222
00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:25.500
roles that serve the plot better John
Constantine was altered into Joanna

223
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.399
Constantine riffing on the fictual 18th
century character in later Sandman

224
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:33.480
stories Hector and lydo were repurposed
so that Lyda could occupy a larger role

225
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.500
and to allow for more connecting tissue
between characters Rose's mother was the

226
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.160
only character cut from the plot with
Lyda now occupying much of that role

227
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.660
instead Lyda absolutely needed to be
here because that dream baby is

228
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.260
important the nightmares brute and glob
were replaced by another nightmare

229
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.980
entirely Galt this is the most
significant change as it portends

230
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.339
directly towards character development
for dream that was not present in the

231
00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:59.519
comics at all or at least development
that takes much longer in the comics

232
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:05.220
it's worth noting however that there is
simply much more Sandman content in the

233
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.100
Netflix series than the corresponding
Comics the existing narrative was beef

234
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.380
up to flush out a whole season unlike
the Final Fantasy 7 remake however the

235
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.800
padding here doesn't seem as apparent in
fact if you're reading the comics after

236
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.800
watching the series you may find that
some of the most outstanding moments are

237
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.160
missing altogether the padding in the
series outside of the adjustments I

238
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.360
mentioned earlier mesh so well into the
Netflix adaptation because they seem to

239
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.380
be flushing out side plots that simply
were never explored in the comics though

240
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.000
strongly indicated and it may shock you
to know that these expanded indicated

241
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.519
plots
we're about queer people

242
00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.920
not to say that they weren't there but
Rose's foyer to a drag Club was only

243
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.000
really suggested in the comics whereas
Netflix gave it an entire musical number

244
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.199
in drag I mean if you're gonna cast John
Cameron Mitchell why not and not all the

245
00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:07.919
praise goes to game it Alan heinberg was
brought on as a co-writer for the series

246
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.699
you can learn more about him in the
power couples video from February of

247
00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:15.419
forever ago heinberg himself is an
openly gay writer with a Strong pedigree

248
00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:19.319
in both comics and screenwriting Gaiman
has always expressed an openness to

249
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.919
queer depictions but the Netflix series
likely with the help of heinberg

250
00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:27.900
expanded them a little
or a lot Additionally the gender swap of

251
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.640
Joanna Constantine which was likely done
to sever this from any variant of DC

252
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.240
adapted interconnected universes smart
move to avoid them at all costs at this

253
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.900
point also made her a lesbian a very
messy lesbian my favorite kind of

254
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.260
lesbian granted nothing about the story
was changed except the magical person's

255
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.220
gender yes there are some human elements
that are true to both straight and queer

256
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:53.220
relationships and that truth is people
are the diner sequence was also

257
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.640
expanded in general but primarily
featuring additional queer people very

258
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.840
messy queer people though certainly even
if we're depicted making mistakes we

259
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.600
ought to recognize that these are the
kinds of mistakes that straight people

260
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.039
also make rose has a gay friend who
Sexes the concept of inhuman masquerade

261
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:11.880
and consumption of identity in the
comics the Corinthian like to stick to

262
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.080
murdering gay men and while there were a
lot of gays to unbury making the

263
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.400
Corinthian more indiscriminate about his
victims and adding another gay side

264
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.380
character who just gets to be a person
was a comfortable correction though as

265
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.419
for the Corinthian in general we have a
Serial killing monster who appears as a

266
00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:34.799
gay man on that have cost to stir in the
queer Community I mean for all the

267
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:37.679
real-life serial killers and mass
Shooters who are straight white men our

268
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:42.360
cultural Consciousness certainly likes
to hold on to the gay ones and the women

269
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.720
this seems Rife for the kind of content
that would trigger our delicate

270
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.500
snowflake sensibilities especially in a
cultural Echo chamber for which the

271
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.700
choir sings you just can't say anything
anymore with increasingly vivacious

272
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.419
intensity pitching a plot where the
primary antagonist is a Serial killing

273
00:18:57.419 --> 00:19:01.740
gay and or bisexual presenting man
really ought to have made the woke

274
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.820
police put a stop to this you know I
guess that's the only underfunded police

275
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.600
force if this wave of apparent left-wing
censorship was as strong as critics to

276
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.760
cry then Sandman would have been purged
from DC archives and yet instead Neil

277
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.860
Gaiman is held up by a substantial queer
fan base many of whom celebrate him for

278
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.080
exposing them to certain areas of
queerness in the first place perhaps you

279
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:31.679
can say anything actually
and turns out that how you say something

280
00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:38.340
and who you are to say it is more
important than what is said in the 1990s

281
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.520
the Corinthian targeted gays because
police were almost certainly never going

282
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.700
to involve themselves in a rash of
murdered vagrant gay men it was playing

283
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.660
on the reality of the situation in a
very real way however cultural

284
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.280
sensibilities have since shifted but
still he himself is an instance of a

285
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.919
very very bad piece of queer
representation regardless of how we

286
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:03.240
human people can identify nightmares as
queer which maybe gaiman's saving Nuance

287
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.580
here he is a monster taking the form of
a gay man to hunt them and even though

288
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.419
there are a few benign queer characters
in Sandman the deck is stacked with

289
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:16.799
morally gray or messy queer characters
not to mention desire's role as the

290
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:21.059
primordial demon twink my apologies if
twink is an unsuitable descriptor for

291
00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:25.559
non-binary people but I
yeah look at them I couldn't exist and

292
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.919
quite frankly to the anti-woke folks
they are right

293
00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:32.700
if this was your average high budget
built by committee TV spectacle series

294
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.900
these plot elements would absolutely get
shot down by the producers on paper

295
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.000
these beats are way too zesty media that
explicitly villainizes queer people is

296
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.080
held to be another component of language
from the 1990s Executives aren't exactly

297
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.580
known for nuance so they tend to build
blanket rules for do's and don'ts and

298
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:55.200
yet the Corinthian and desire are still
here and people may be thirsty for them

299
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.220
regardless the diner lesbian with a
temper is here all of John Constantine's

300
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.360
male messiness is now Joanna's Sapphic
messiness and still Gaiman maintains his

301
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.280
staunch Bowie s queer following so if
the woke police did come for Gaiman what

302
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.559
was his get out of jail free card
it's conceptually simple

303
00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:17.179
though actually quite complicated

304
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.080
the simple explanation is you have to
care a lot and Care is demonstrated not

305
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.080
something that you can just declare
politicians say they care about lots of

306
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.140
things but demonstrate very little when
it comes to problematic queer characters

307
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.640
and for those of us who are queer we
know many problematic queer people this

308
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.720
is not explicitly forbidden but it is
kind of taboo while Gaiman made a bold

309
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.960
start with Sandman he still had an
affectionate portrayal of an

310
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.020
indescribably queer romance and good
Omens generally speaking demonstrating

311
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.799
positive queer folks in one work will
implore your audience to read Nuance

312
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:56.580
into the messy queers in another
regardless of just those two Gaiman has

313
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.640
been incorporating not only queer
characters but even queer adjacent

314
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.419
themes into his body of work ever since
the most infamous outside of his

315
00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:07.380
earphalon Crowley anyway was the
notorious deified gay sex scene in

316
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.580
American Gods a burnt out salesman from
the Middle East struggles with his time

317
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.020
in America while trying to Pedal goods
for an ungrateful family while in a taxi

318
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.159
he relates to the driver how hard it is
to keep up a smile in the land of

319
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:24.780
opportunity the pair become quite close
through the ride the cab driver it turns

320
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:30.179
out is a Jinn who immigrated to America
well provided the lore of American Gods

321
00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:34.320
it was the idea of a Jinn who made the
migration a different version of the

322
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.679
same if it likely still exists in his
homeland it's complicated anyway they

323
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:41.100
smash turns out they're both kind of
equally dissatisfied with how things are

324
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.020
going the Gin is nowhere to be found the
morning after but has left his taxi

325
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.480
driver's identification on the
nightstand

326
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.220
only now with the salesman's face for
the picture an opportunity for a new

327
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.480
life away from his oppressive family
even though it's just a disconnected

328
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.380
vignette and a story it's still a
heartfelt standout moment you may be

329
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.860
deceived into thinking this is about
being gay but it's actually about being

330
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.620
different and alone in a place with too
many people especially in our Post 9 11

331
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.159
Western cultural stereotype of the
Arabian peninsula

332
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:19.980
it's significant to make this the spot
for graphic gay sex in this great

333
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.159
American novel don't read anything into
it most of the Great American novels are

334
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:26.220
written by Brits it's important to
remember that at a period of time when

335
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.760
Europe was tying up women and gay men
and throwing them into reasonably sized

336
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.480
ponds to see if they floated to the
surface thereby indicating their

337
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.240
connection to Witchcraft for which they
would then be removed from the water

338
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.580
thoroughly dried and then burnt at the
stake that Constantinople at the same

339
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.100
time was the cultural Progressive Hub of
the world scientifically culturally

340
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.179
philosophically artistically it also
possessed a massive swath of Europeans

341
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:54.780
who had fled as refugees from whatever
Inquisition Crusade or ethnic cleansing

342
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.840
was going on in Continental Europe at
the time the reason why I would say that

343
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.820
this and other instances of gaiman's
queer Library performed so strongly is

344
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.900
that there's very little sensationalism
regarding these characters that is he

345
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.460
doesn't really make a fuss about queer
characters where we appear we're just

346
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.000
there there is nothing about the
exchange that says oh look gay

347
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.679
characters they're just characters and
then gay stuff happens sometimes but

348
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:22.740
mostly they're just characters who
contribute to what he's trying to say

349
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.520
the same purpose he has for straight
characters granted Gaiman also includes

350
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.360
eluded queer characters in his books and
generally I'm annoyed by eluded

351
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.260
characters however when Coraline is told
from the perspective of a nine-year-old

352
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.340
the protagonist isn't really going to
read into why the two bickering elderly

353
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.880
actresses in the basement flat are
living together again I'm only opposed

354
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.320
to the illusion of queerness if it's a
crutch used to present the illusion to

355
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.820
impressionable baby queers that they're
being seen as Gaiman has demonstrated a

356
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.820
comfort level with queer characters a
decision to imply that these two

357
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.299
characters are lesbians is based off of
artistic Vision rather than an

358
00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:00.900
uncertainty about the audience like With
Yuri on Ice taking a moment away from

359
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.140
the narrative flow to specify that these
characters fall under the queer umbrella

360
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.320
would interrupt the underlying themes if
there ought to be a definition of forced

361
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.400
inclusion then that would be it Coraline
is about a child developing the ability

362
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.299
to recognize identity in other people
this woman is my mother because of X

363
00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:19.919
this other woman who only looks like my
mother is not actually my mother and as

364
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:24.299
it is a children's book having more
themes presented will detract from what

365
00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:26.940
young readers are meant to take away
from it and this is part of the

366
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.880
consequences of being part of a
community that has been so gaslit into

367
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.380
believing that half-assed inclusion can
qualify as representation any instance

368
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.279
of representation needs to feature that
rough gay sex scene or just doesn't

369
00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:41.940
count there needs to be that soapbox
moment where the gay characters stand up

370
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.179
and make a Love Is Love Speech there
needs to be that gratuitously horny gay

371
00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:49.320
character who is either desperate for a
long-term relationship or hits on

372
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.279
everything incessantly to let the
audience know that he's gay do any of

373
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:56.880
you realize how many comments I still
get on the Yuri on Ice video to this day

374
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.659
aggressively arguing that the anime is
bad representation because you don't see

375
00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:03.960
lips touching during the kiss then again
that video still gets comments from

376
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.299
usually straight women no hating but
still who incessantly deny that there is

377
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:13.200
any queerness coded or otherwise present
in that series the pressure to exist as

378
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.279
openly gay as Paul possible in fiction
has a toxic translation to real life

379
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.720
most gay people don't think about their
gayness and ways to perpetuate it

380
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.980
especially because these methods of
self-promotion as established in fiction

381
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.620
Focus around either having or trying to
get a committed boyfriend or persevering

382
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.919
over social pressures and persecution
according to fiction the only two gay

383
00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:38.880
Milestones that matter are coming out
and boyfriend and I have concerns for

384
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.900
this community if we are internalizing
these messages doubling back to good

385
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.100
Omens for a minute how is it possible in
this circumstance for these characters

386
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.360
to fit into clearly defined visible
representation they can't slash don't

387
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.799
have sex their genders are complete
anachronistic chaos and they don't

388
00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:00.360
appear to experience physical pleasure
kissing is a gesture Kneel To Angels and

389
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.779
Demons have a concentration of nerve
endings in their lips which result in a

390
00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:07.080
pleasant sensation upon physical
stimulation you you make up the rules

391
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.799
about this so I'm just wondering what
would it take for these two to properly

392
00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:15.779
depict gay or queer attitudes I highly
doubt a Cosmic entity would go on about

393
00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:19.380
love being loved especially when their
relationship revolves around the world

394
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.500
ending or not especially when the
majority of anti-gay discrimination

395
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.779
revolves around persecuting sexual acts
however I would prefer we don't say that

396
00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:32.159
this is bad representation because these
are two very queer characters involved

397
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:36.539
in a non-sexual romance and since
asexual people do exist believe it or

398
00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:40.860
not I think that's pretty valid and so
no not all representation needs to be

399
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.400
about queer acceptance or normalization
sometimes it's nice to just see yourself

400
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.419
in a quirky character that isn't to say
that's all we need to be sometimes we

401
00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:52.320
really do need messaging directed at us
in messaging that normalizes us Caiman

402
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.919
also happens to have some of that too
though in Sandman no less

403
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.440
granted this is regarding a trans
character and as per contemporary

404
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.240
discussions about appropriate trans
representation there are some pitfalls I

405
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.120
wouldn't want to try and tell trans
people what is or is not good

406
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.200
representation for them though from what
I've read people seem to feel generally

407
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.000
positive about this one Possible season
two spoilers ahead the game of you Arc

408
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.919
of Sandman follows Barbara Barbie from
season one who journeyed with Martin ten

409
00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:29.460
bones to bring the porpentine to the
hierogram and who has since broken up

410
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.299
with Ken she is best friends with Wanda
who is helping her figure out how to

411
00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:37.380
navigate New York City Wanda is trans
and though she never specifies to anyone

412
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.580
I am trans this becomes apparent
throughout dialogue cues Wanda is

413
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.659
talkative and we get a small glimpse
into her trans experience though she

414
00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:50.400
remains externally positive she trusts
Barbara enough to let her dead name slip

415
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.179
the warns Barbara never to use it an
antagonist doesn't seem to approve of

416
00:28:54.179 --> 00:28:57.960
her though she can ignore him though
Gaiman is subtle enough to indicate that

417
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.320
these bigoted remarks and encounters
have an effect on her and by subtle I'm

418
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.279
mean that she has a dream where Bizarro
aliens are forcing her to choose to be a

419
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.179
man or a woman decisions around gender
affirming surgeries are ultimately at

420
00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:13.740
the decision of the individual to
undertake or not her dream indicates

421
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.620
that she is struggling internally with
the pressure to make a commitment

422
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.860
through the progression of this story
Wanda's Womanhood is routinely

423
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.760
challenged because she is uncomfortable
with the idea of surgery at least at

424
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.260
this point in her life Wanda does die in
the story and while this may fit into a

425
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.799
buried queer Trope it's worth noting
that Wanda does not die because of

426
00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:35.700
bigotry she dies when her building
collapses in a freak hurricane which may

427
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.520
or may not have been caused by
witchcraft it's also worth noting that

428
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.960
Wanda's death is not there to make the
CIS characters react or to make the

429
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.679
audience sad Barbara has already
undergone an emotional Arc in her

430
00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:51.360
appearance at Wanda's Southern Funeral
her only New York friend to appear is to

431
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.559
pay respects and crossout Wanda's dead
name on her tombstone and write her name

432
00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:59.520
over it in flamingo pink lipstick
however death has a different function

433
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.539
in the Sandman Series where death is a
character herself and one may argue that

434
00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:07.320
death functions differently in all of
gaiman's Works Gaiman in general is very

435
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.559
nonchalant about death even when a
character dies to propel the plot

436
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:14.880
there's very little sensation derived
from it sometimes people die in fact in

437
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.760
the graveyard book most of the
characters are dead Gaiman treats death

438
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.720
in fiction as if it is not the end of a
character and this is very literal in

439
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.120
Sandman in this world most people who
die are taken by death to her Realm a

440
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.020
place the panels do not take us we
understand that just like any other

441
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.480
character Wanda woke after her death and
was greeted by a compassionate woman to

442
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.460
take her away but death is comfortable
bending the rules just a little bit very

443
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:46.080
Case by case basis Barbara has a dream
and she remembers from this dream seeing

444
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.380
Wanda
Wanda here in death

445
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.980
is fully feminized
and no this isn't telling us that death

446
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.159
will make everything better this is
visual language to indicate that the

447
00:30:56.159 --> 00:31:00.059
cosmic forces of the universe recognize
your identity for who you are

448
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:05.039
it's the same message of the entire
Sandman series emotional reality is more

449
00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:09.120
significant Than Physical reality which
is a hell of a debate to include in a

450
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.539
comic book written by a CIS man like
holy can you imagine any of that

451
00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:15.840
happening today Mark the calendar and
count the days until Wanda appears in a

452
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.720
trailer for an upcoming season a Sandman
and people immediately to cry

453
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.860
everything's being about trans stuff
these days however I did say that this

454
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.460
is a complicated process and Gaiman
especially in the long long ago before

455
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.740
Reddit would have had to have had some
real conversations with trans people to

456
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.480
really understand how to convey these
themes the best of intentions is not

457
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.500
enough and in spite of Good Intentions
things can go awry a category of that

458
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.460
contains Thomas Harris in his novel
Silence of the Lambs the trans

459
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.559
representation is
lacking

460
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.240
the movie especially because it offers
no insight into trans attitudes at all

461
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.860
in spite of depicting the villain
the way they did

462
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.679
the book actually goes to Great length
to describe trans women and in fact

463
00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:05.460
exonerate them Hannibal Lecter goes so
far as to suggest that Jane Gum cannot

464
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.960
be trans because they are violent Harris
describes trans women as people who

465
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.100
transition to being women to live as
women and for no other reason but

466
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.340
regardless of the fact that Harris does
go out of his way to try and say the

467
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.539
trans people are okay what is depicted
in the book sends a very harmful message

468
00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:27.480
I would claim that Thomas Harris is
someone who is trying to do a good thing

469
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.380
because the novel contains unambiguous
language which declares that trans women

470
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.399
are not violent or anti-social without
exception even if you kind of failed at

471
00:32:35.399 --> 00:32:40.140
presenting that this is what he wrote I
would contrast that with something like

472
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.940
Ace Ventura which is actively malicious
belittling and hateful forgive the

473
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.440
archaic phrasing but Hannibal says that
ballet is not a real transsexual

474
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.940
but he thinks he is he tries to be he's
trying to be a lot of things I expect

475
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.380
gum was described as a disqualified
outlier who fetishized Womanhood rather

476
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.100
than someone who felt that they actually
were a woman if that makes sense it

477
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.640
doesn't really it's an e for effort
situation really because there is a lot

478
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.299
wrong with this yes Harris seems to want
to implore his audience to observe trans

479
00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:12.179
people with more empathy while
presenting a villain who is trans

480
00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:15.240
identifying and without incorporating
any other trans characters into the

481
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.779
story whatsoever not even to
counterbalance Buffalo Bill this is all

482
00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:23.940
we got and what pro-trans rhetoric there
was in the novel was not so present in

483
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.419
the film in conjunction Harris
incorporates a deeply triggering element

484
00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:32.279
of the trans experience in the book a
CIS doctor making claims about what does

485
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:38.100
or does not qualify as Womanhood there
is a precedent for Built Tough trans

486
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.320
women who have to pretend to be deeply
invested in pretty flowery dresses to

487
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.940
get past their doctors contemporary
queer Theory and this is even present in

488
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.380
gaiman's discourse around Wanda holds
the gender is self-defined the only

489
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.640
qualification to be a man woman or other
is for you to feel that way trying to

490
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.700
justify your gender to a medical
professional has been historically one

491
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.360
of the most arduous parts of the trans
experience even though I would not

492
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.960
recommend diying your endocrine system
without a medical professional I feel

493
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.099
the onus needs to be put on the medical
community to establish more trust many

494
00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:15.060
Physicians are working hard to mend this
Gap yes but there's still progress to be

495
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.980
made a lot Harris however is notorious
shut-in it's clear that he garnished his

496
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.659
information from academic sources rather
than the living breathing component of a

497
00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.740
culture if you're trying to represent
people then the people you want to

498
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.760
represent need to be where you start
however a good intentions alone cannot

499
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.919
and should not exonerate harm that was
brought into the world so if just caring

500
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:41.099
isn't enough
how much more complicated does it need

501
00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:43.339
to be

502
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.220
the more complicated reality of good
representation is that it's very

503
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.899
difficult cocktail of empathy as it
intersects with the willingness to

504
00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:59.580
listen a compulsion to profess the
ability to reflect on certain people and

505
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.320
situations their lies and ability to
isolate what elements of those

506
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.700
experiences are endearing to reflect
back upon those people while having an

507
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.079
understanding of what is or can be a
universal experience and what is or can

508
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:16.680
be fictionalized for instance when it
comes to men writing women there was

509
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.859
either not a whole lot of attention
given to female characters in the first

510
00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:23.520
place or failed attempts to understand
them Helen of Troy was attributed to

511
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.660
having spurred Menelaus and sparked the
Trojan War because Perros of Troy was

512
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.280
just so darn pretty that motivation was
so weak even 2004's Troy had to develop

513
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.119
an entire subplot about how Menelaus was
so toxic that Helen's only recourse was

514
00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:39.300
to leave with the first man who could
smuggle her at asparta men literally

515
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.800
have fictionalized women as accessories
to men because historically patriarchal

516
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.880
values in society would Define that as
the role of woman it was only in the

517
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.700
last century or so that a woman could
open a bank account without a man

518
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.720
signing for it be it her father her
brother husband or gay best friend for

519
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.619
which he would still have unbridled
access to it in much of fiction women

520
00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.460
spend their time fussing over a man or
dramatically falling into his arms

521
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.119
without any personal goals or
motivations except to be with a

522
00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:09.780
particular man even perceptively strong
female characters like Scarlett O'Hara

523
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.500
in the end
are solely focused on a man that isn't

524
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.859
to say that you can't have men who
develop excellent fictional women in

525
00:36:16.859 --> 00:36:20.040
history but at the same time there is no
guarantee that women are going to write

526
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.359
excellent female characters either woman
is not a monolithic experience for which

527
00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:29.460
every aspect of Womanhood is accessible
to every woman no one woman can embody

528
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.420
all the experiences within their gender
but when you belong to one particular

529
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.660
experience you may have an easier time
extrapolating on different

530
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.320
manifestations of that experience I can
imagine myself as a different man

531
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.740
because those experiences are
tangentially related to my experiences

532
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.099
it's not that it's more difficult per se
for a CIS man to write a female

533
00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:51.420
character however it does require a
great deal more research empathy and

534
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.839
observation Stephen King is pretty good
at this there's a reason why his first

535
00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:58.920
novel Carrie has become a regular in
feminist Theory classes and queer Theory

536
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.520
watch my video on deep cuts to find out
why he's also great at writing female

537
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.440
villains like with misery but when it
usually comes to villains well that's

538
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.160
rough especially in America audiences
tend to lean towards the idea that the

539
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.119
protagonist is the character whose
values are meant to be emulated the

540
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:19.320
antagonist by contrast is demonized
which typically holds that everything

541
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.579
about the antagonist is a problem and
ought to be shunned back to Gaiman how

542
00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:27.720
is it that the weird queer kids flock to
him in spite of desire and the

543
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.560
Corinthian or other less than flattering
queer characters especially when he does

544
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.700
not have a great deal of openly queer
Heroes the key there is that these

545
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.900
characters are villains because of their
objectives and motivations but they are

546
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.820
not villains because they're queer and
they are not villains because of their

547
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.660
queerness and it's true of most queer
villains lately too we're beginning to

548
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.980
make a comeback as villains because of
this not so simple trick and truly being

549
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.700
able to have a character's motivations
separated from their identity

550
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.900
isn't a talent every writer has though
it's far from the only important Talent

551
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.800
out there but for those who can deliver
it generally makes for a better

552
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.700
character to have intersectional
compartments of their personhood

553
00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:18.900
the secret to representation at its core
is not to represent if representation is

554
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.740
the goal it's going to suck the
objective needs to be life the author is

555
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.400
not to look at themselves as a Creator
but a gatekeeper their role is to allow

556
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.020
identities to be found where they are in
real life to show the hypothetical lives

557
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.180
these people may lead to create an
imagined version of this person based on

558
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.160
the kinds of people who live like this
and it can't come from nothing the best

559
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.800
fiction is plagiarism of life even if
it's fantasy especially if it's fantasy

560
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.160
because if your protagonists are
jousting on griffins or discovering

561
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.839
Ancient Aliens under the ice caps the
reader needs something human to grab

562
00:38:54.839 --> 00:38:59.400
onto they really can only truly imagine
something incredible the more they can

563
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.760
imagine a real person doing it I
highlighted the queer element of

564
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.079
American Gods very deliberately it was a
queer reference to a matter of a

565
00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:11.160
pansexual deity that is very heavily
supported by documented historical

566
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.300
reality given the current a cultural
climate of this world that reality is

567
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.960
selectively forgotten we are disinclined
to portray or even remember that because

568
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.619
it does not align with our present day
perspective of the world gaiman's

569
00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:30.119
positive betrayal of queer people begins
with this he forces others to remember

570
00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:34.560
what they willfully forget it seems to
be part of the quintessential queer

571
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.780
experience if others like me had existed
then others like me must exist now

572
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:44.579
Gaiman Works to spell out a Fantastical
realm of Dreams where reality waffles

573
00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:49.020
and Imagination runs wild all things are
possible because the only rules that

574
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.339
exist in this place are the rules you
bring to it we spend one third of our

575
00:39:53.339 --> 00:39:57.180
lives in this world of Dreams why
wouldn't we want to spend it all there

576
00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.740
surely we can imagine a world where all
the dour Grand challenges of our lives

577
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.280
and societies become Petty grievances
that can be ignored

578
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.140
we can be anything do anything so much
more than the limitations of our own

579
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.579
world where we must share the dream of a
sleeping God

580
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:19.680
our realities are at odds with others
and an absolute truth for one is not an

581
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.700
absolute truth for all
however there is a pivotal weakness to

582
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.859
the dreaming and a pivotal limitation to
dreams Powers though vast they may seem

583
00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:33.119
dreams are lonely places
when we sleep we are solitary save for

584
00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:37.619
the odd ghosts drifting through
our dreams we confront the possibility

585
00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:41.640
of what the world could be
the world as we would make it if we

586
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.820
could
the world as we would most fear it to

587
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.000
become
dreams cannot be our reality because

588
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.480
Dreams Are Meant to reflect reality and
we can look at them as Idol

589
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.560
entertainment or we could think of it
like slipping into a different existence

590
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.460
in a change room just to see how it
looks though the advantage of Dreams is

591
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.760
that we can make them real
in a fashion

592
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.500
we can take what we like and work to
make it true we can ward off what we

593
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.240
fear we can explore the fringes of our
imagination in a way our waking Minds

594
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.740
would dismiss as Idol fantasy
the extent of the world we want to

595
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:21.060
create doesn't need to end in dreams
dreams are a mirror that can reflect the

596
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.880
future
for all that we create our dreams

597
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.339
without thinking it's still possible
though challenging to create our reality

598
00:41:29.339 --> 00:41:34.560
though it is easier to create a world we
all dream of together

599
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.359
having a dream is not teasing a reality
that could never be

600
00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:44.220
it becomes an obligation
to make it come true
