00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.770
THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKILLSHARE
No. 6 is a manga that began in 2011 and concluded

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.210
in 2016, contained in a neat nine-volume collection.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.820
A far cry from some of the sprawling, endless
manga that seem to dominate the sales charts.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.820
Despite how condensed the story is, the series
has maintained a fanbase to this day, though.

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.460
Seemingly able to navigate topics that many
other franchises take much longer to fully

6
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.270
explore, themes and messages are clearly narrated
whereas many series find their messaging lost

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.809
in the curse of ‘taking too damn long to
make a point.’

8
00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.270
This is a good example of less being more.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.789
Despite the popularity of the manga, fans
generally didn’t have kind things to say

10
00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.260
about the anime adaptation, though.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.710
A common complaint being that the already
brisk pacing was condensed even further, and

12
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.110
many of the nuances were lost.

13
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.949
I guess you can’t win them all.

14
00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.790
No. 6 tells the story of Shion and his survivalist
misadventure to overthrow a tyrannical Orwellian

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.980
Dystopian government with a refugee-criminal
who calls himself ‘Rat.’

16
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.320
Contrary to a number of other stories in the
era of early 2010s YA Dystopia (aside from

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.270
the protagonists being gay) No. 6 stands out
by focusing on the social indoctrination side

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.770
of things, rather than strictly being governed
under an iron fist.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.470
The ‘soft touch’ approach to depicting
a society under the thumb of a ruling state

20
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.950
power is more complicated, but it pays off
when done well.

21
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.920
Truth be told, I feel like this is less of
a matter of taste and more of a matter of

22
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.420
American creators being uncomfortable with
the idea in general.

23
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.780
The more you depict this sweet spot of report-thy-neighbour
police state, the closer it looks in proximity

24
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.680
to contemporary American realities.

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.860
And we’re not ready to talk about that just
yet, apparently.

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.780
America can either confront the grim reality
of late-stage McCarthyism its in or raise

27
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.490
the bar a little higher and wait until the
government starts imposing curfew with walrus-tiger

28
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.710
hybrid clones which bear the faces of deceased
relatives.

29
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.670
And THEN we might start thinking about writing
an angry letter to your district overlord.

30
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.390
But as far as statements No.6 makes about
society, you really don’t need to read past

31
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.879
page 10… beyond that is useful, but essentially
boils down to elaborating on how this world

32
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.590
sucks, gay stuff, and trauma.

33
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.040
But before we get into all that, and a whole
lot more and how it relates to the LGB movement,

34
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.800
let’s hear a word from this videos sponsor.

35
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.500
THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKILLSHARE

36
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.610
I’ve actually used Skill Share for years,
and I’ve found it really helpful even with

37
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.989
making these videos.

38
00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.129
One of the biggest things it's helped me with
is using Adobe After Effects, which can be

39
00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.310
labyrinthian in its complexities.

40
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.959
And which I use to create the opening titles
for these videos.

41
00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.989
In particular the Create Motion Graphics Templates
with After Effects course on Skillshare.

42
00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.269
It’s shorter than a Pixar movie and helped
me learn to create some great dynamic opening

43
00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.269
sequences.

44
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.409
With everyone changing careers or starting
their own businesses, a site like Skill Share

45
00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.220
can be incredibly useful.

46
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.930
From learning a new skill to help increase
the quality of the work, like me, or learning

47
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.900
how to do your own accounting, or even learning
a whole new skillset without spending 4 more

48
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.290
years in school to do it.

49
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.680
My business partner, Nick, is taking a photography
course on Skillshare right now.

50
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.150
And right now Skillshare is offering one month
free to allof my viewers that use the link

51
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.629
in the description box, but only for the rest
of April.

52
00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.290
But they’re running an even better offer!

53
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.770
If you’re ready to start learning today
with Skillshare, you can get 40% off your

54
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.269
first year using my link!

55
00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.830
I’m going to leave both links down in the
description so you can choose the best one

56
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.830
for you.

57
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.799
But either way you get started, Skill Share
is a legitimately great resource.

58
00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.600
I can’t recommend it enough.

59
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.430
So once you’ve finished this video, head
on down to the description and start learning

60
00:03:52.430 --> 00:05:16.539
a new skill with Skillshare today.

61
00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.060
The city called ‘No.6’ is presented as
an isolated utopia — the english translation

62
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.750
uses the phrase ‘holy city.’

63
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.250
The city of No.6, seems largely secular.

64
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.060
But the language of being a holy city does
establish the way the people revere the city,

65
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.530
and the extent to which people approach their
loyalty to it.

66
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.340
The city itself — including its government
and administration — cannot be at fault

67
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.160
for anything because the people owe the city
an inherent debt of gratitude.

68
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.930
(Granted, the minutiae of this is more apparent
past the opening 10 pages.)

69
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.270
Suffice to say, the people are generally reluctant
or afraid to direct any criticism at the city

70
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.740
itself, provided either reverence for the
city or fear of what the city can do to those

71
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.490
who do not demonstrate the utmost loyalty.

72
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.990
This regularly comes as a shock to Americans,
but most places in the world do not demand

73
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.650
a daily pledge of allegiance — especially
not from children in educational facilities.

74
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.120
Many nations do not even play the National
Anthem to open a school day.

75
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.740
Whenever this is depicted in the media OUTSIDE
of America, this is often a creator exemplifying,

76
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.530
in no uncertain terms, fascist undertones
(or at least toxic nationalism).

77
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.310
As the story goes on there are further examples
of the way the citizens of No.6 take the city’s

78
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.250
protections for granted, further reinforcing
the ideas established in the opening sequence.

79
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.010
However, where No.6 stands out from many of
its contemporaries is the dedication to showing

80
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.420
how the population itself has a passive role
in its own persecution.

81
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.710
Normally, in stories about an oppressive government,
a placated population is often taken for granted,

82
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.530
and there is not a whole lot of time given
to depicting how or why that population is

83
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.530
the way it is.

84
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.449
The important part, for this media, is that
things are the way they are because the heroes

85
00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.580
need an oppressive force to fight against.

86
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.100
They cannot conduct these battles in the open
for fear of prying eyes.

87
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.680
OR, (and this is more common in American dystopian
fiction) you’ll get the flipside where the

88
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.900
government has a much more active role in
using martial law to oppress the population.

89
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.470
The populace is very aware that it is being
oppressed, and is usually depicted as waiting

90
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.470
for the first available excuse to spark the
revolution.

91
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.430
Americans love to think they’d rise up in
revolution against a tin pot dictator, but

92
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.930
y'all have been awful quiet about the Supreme
Court taking away your rights.

93
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.930
Anyway.

94
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.490
In the former instance, however, and I feel
this is much closer to reality, the population

95
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.400
does not know they are being oppressed, and
therefore have no context for freedom.

96
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.039
If an oppressed people believe they are already
free, they will not pursue freedom.

97
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.720
In fact, because a significant portion of
the population is comfortable in its own oppression,

98
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.150
it will actively resist any change in the
status quo.

99
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.120
People who can contextualise this idea of
freedom are those who can either read patterns

100
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.780
objectively, or those who exist outside of
social norms and constructs.

101
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.120
This is the first observation made in George
Orwell’s 1984.

102
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.169
The state is dependent on intellectuals to
research and apply totalitarian principals

103
00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:08.490
to the population at large.

104
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.370
However, these same intellectuals pose a threat
to the stability of the regime, because the

105
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.470
mechanical workings of mass manipulation cannot
work on someone who can naturally analyse

106
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.389
and deconstruct social conventions.

107
00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:21.389
Granted…

108
00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:22.389
It's easy to say that.

109
00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:26.930
The ‘intellectual class’ is actually much
more vulnerable to groupthink than self-proclaimed

110
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.870
free-thinkers would have you believe.

111
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:35.140
But they pose a risk to totalitarianism nevertheless
— not the GREATEST risk, but we’ll get

112
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.140
into that.

113
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.130
In No.6 — Shion represents this.

114
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.919
His acknowledged intelligence is a double-edged
sword for him.

115
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.280
Intellect with loyalty is a good thing.

116
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.620
Intellect with critical thinking is a liability.

117
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.190
It’s why the modern academic curriculum
— especially in America — promotes STEM

118
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.270
programs so strongly.

119
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:58.130
You generally do not NEED critical thought
to succeed in maths and sciences: challenging

120
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.730
social conventions is not a prerequisite for
designing a new app.

121
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.690
Meanwhile the humanities are dipping out of
popularity and there is almost no worker demand

122
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.670
for studies deriving from critical thought.

123
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.940
Maths and sciences produce products that are
valuable to the state or the economy.

124
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.029
They are intellect that the State can control
and exploit.

125
00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:23.519
Ethics and media literacy generally exist
to insist that the state should not control

126
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.519
intellect.

127
00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:27.399
This is counter-productive to the agenda of
an overarching institutional body.

128
00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:31.780
It’s made clear to Shion that if the state
cannot facilitate complete control of his

129
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.500
intellect, then he is a threat.

130
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.600
While this discussion is present in Orwell,
it’s actually a more prominent theme in

131
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.910
the writings of Vonnegut.

132
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.910
But that’s enough name-dropping.

133
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.910
For now.

134
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.339
The very opening of No.6 features a display
of indoctrinating children into this groupthink

135
00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:47.600
of State-Worship.

136
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.829
And this was compounded with the first plot
arc, of how Shion lost his lofty status in

137
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:57.120
society — by showing compassion to an escaped
prisoner (Rat) instead of reporting him.

138
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.750
In an instant, he demonstrates that his compassion
for another human being was stronger than

139
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.600
his loyalty to the state.

140
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.930
Again, something we’ll come back to later
on.

141
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.220
Already the parallels to 1984 are highlighted
by government structure where law enforcement

142
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.200
is dependent-in-part upon the people to police
eachother.

143
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.660
Keep in mind there is a difference between
policing yourself and policing others.

144
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.330
Social indoctrination is when the population
is convinced that these things are one in

145
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
the same.

146
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.700
First, the people are expected to act as eyes
and ears for law enforcement — observing

147
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.980
and reporting other citizens’ actions.

148
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.480
And later it is suggested that law enforcement
may monitor individual conversations for indications

149
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.389
of what is tantamount to thought-crime.

150
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:41.779
Of course, a system of citizen-policing really
only works in instances of the people believing

151
00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.910
that they owe their allegiance or loyalty
to the state.

152
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.350
And then trusting the state enough to honestly
believe that monitoring the population at

153
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.709
large is for the greater good.

154
00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:51.740
The reason why this…

155
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.779
OUGHT to be so terrifying to us is because
this power structure is the exact antithesis

156
00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.930
of democracy: where the state owes its loyalty
and service to the people.

157
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.279
Despite the fact that…

158
00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.339
there are many democratic nations which seem
to flirt with the former.

159
00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:07.339
All the time.

160
00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:11.230
And maybe it’s just the fact that I read
this at a very specific time that while I

161
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.589
drew these parallels between No.6 and our
society — namely within, but not limited

162
00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:19.709
to, American politics — a lot of this feels
hauntingly familiar.

163
00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:24.060
Yes, the American government specifically
has been encouraging citizens to report suspected

164
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:30.779
terrorists and undocumented immigrants to
the police for… most…

165
00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:31.779
most of my life.

166
00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:38.840
But I wouldn’t have expected to see these
kinds of State-Loyalist values within the

167
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.250
Queer community.

168
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:52.760
While it was something that I found only annoying,
I’m now starting to become actively concerned

169
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.130
with the degree that being a queer narc is
coming into vogue.

170
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.130
Sorry…

171
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.290
these people don’t really like being called
queer.

172
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.279
I’m perfectly fine with queer people who
want to fit into the heteronormative framework

173
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.010
of Euro-American hegemony.

174
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.980
Like all rights movements, queer rights is
about affording people in this group the same

175
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.990
choices and opportunities that exist for those
of privilege.

176
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.889
Choosing to exist in this framework is, and
ought to be, as valid as choosing NOT to exist

177
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:19.930
in this framework.

178
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.890
The joint effort for rights affords people
the ability to conform.

179
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.529
In return, the conformers are expected to
uphold the rights of those that choose not

180
00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:32.149
to conform, though want to be left unbothered
by the system.

181
00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:37.220
And so, I have issues which arise with the
way certain factions feel that, while it’s

182
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.980
okay to be gay— NOBODY should be ‘queer.’

183
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.029
And that they themselves have absolutely nothing
but contempt for being included in any kind

184
00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.740
of ‘queerness.’

185
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.000
Nevermind that the academic school of thought
is called queer theory — and is held alongside

186
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.639
other schools of literary and cultural criticism.

187
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:56.420
And has a particular role for analysing the
social interplay between those within and

188
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.940
those without the hetero-cis-normative hegemony.

189
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.250
However as I would like to be referred to
with respect by these people, I will respect

190
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:12.630
their preferences for how they describe themselves,
and instead will refer to the **LGB alliance’s**

191
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.180
generally-agreed-upon self-identification.

192
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.850
Which is the same thing as we have, but with…
less.

193
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:25.540
On one hand it’s a little bit uncouth to
participate in call-out culture and possibly

194
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:31.580
confront anyone watching this who may identify
with this LGB Alliance… but on the other

195
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:38.020
hand I’ve spent the last several years being
very clear about my political and social support

196
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:44.130
for trans, nonbinary, and any other letter-identities
that go past the first three in the acronym.

197
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.811
Even ace people who really ought to be the
Switzerland of this discussion, though you

198
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:52.410
can’t get far without someone saying that
‘asexualism is invalidating homosexualty’

199
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.410
or whatever.

200
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.089
In fact I’ve been vocal about dismissing
the use of acronyms altogether.

201
00:13:57.089 --> 00:14:03.430
In part because the modular nature of the
jumble of letters can give some people licence

202
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:09.320
to actively dismiss and ignore members of
our community who were foundational in our

203
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.389
fight for rights.

204
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:15.920
I can’t help but feel like this… dissonant
community would prefer not to find an overarching

205
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.940
name because then they would lose a method
of excluding people and that seems to be their

206
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.139
unifying value.

207
00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:30.210
Kreia: “To be united by hatred is a fragile
alliance at best.”

208
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:36.130
And also because the 100% plan is to cut the
B out whenever they… win?

209
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.339
What even is the win condition for the LGB
alliance, as an activism group?

210
00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:43.920
Facilitating ongoing discrimination against
a community of people whose identities revolve

211
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.490
around alternative and non-cis gender identities?

212
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:52.160
Because their help was certainly NOT needed
to assure ongoing discrimination against trans

213
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.870
people in this society.

214
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.930
What are they actually fighting for…?

215
00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.620
From what I can gather, hating trans people
is actually a secondary objective of theirs..

216
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.190
Sure, yeah, they hate trans people but what
are they trying to accomplish with that hate?

217
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.480
When the hegemony discriminates against something
outside of itself, the objective is to reinforce

218
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.211
an ongoing structure of social supremacy or
to limit the number of individuals who can

219
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:16.180
benefit from social privileges.

220
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.370
Being able to hate an entire other social
group, identity, or ethnicity in itself is

221
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.870
a social luxury.

222
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.339
This is why non-queer TERF philosophy reads
hollow because it’s trying so desperately

223
00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:32.750
to convince you that there is an objective
or an end-goal.

224
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.269
In practice, though, the end goal seems to
be a demonstration of what social authority

225
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:42.529
they already have, by flexing it over a very
small, very vulnerable target demographic.

226
00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:44.850
They hide hate by pretending to have a cause:

227
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.290
“We don’t HATE these people because we
WANT to.

228
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.620
We care about THIS issue, and therefore we
HAVE to hate these people.”

229
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.430
The care is propagated to come first — but
they just want an excuse to hate something.

230
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.730
Whereas, if hate was the primary objective
of the LGB Alliance, they would have a mission

231
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.760
statement that would support their hatred.

232
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.819
Instead, their hatred supports their actual
ideology:

233
00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:11.570
“The trans people are being targeted by
our new straight friends — in order to maintain

234
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.830
what privileges we have, we need to demonstrate
that we don’t like them either.”

235
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.600
Hatred is a consequence of their objective.

236
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.079
Which results in many queer people feeling
that they either have to dictate how trans

237
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:26.279
people should live their lives (spoiler, it’s
either detransitioning or gender-conformity)

238
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:31.170
or are perfectly comfortable broadcasting
disgust towards trans people and/or nonbinary

239
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.690
gender expressions.

240
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.350
While it may be easy to say that this is a
very queer-boomer mindset, I am seeing an

241
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:42.149
unfortunate rash of queer whipper-snappers
who have nothing but contempt for Jeffery

242
00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:45.240
Marsh and other vocal genderqueer advocates.

243
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.250
They also seem to be in the same camp as people
who want to condemn kink and other visible

244
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.390
indicators of a healthy, consensual sex life.

245
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.710
Because if the hetero-hegemony wants to keep
any trace of non-conformist sex out of everyday

246
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.390
life, then people who want heterosexual privileges
ALSO want that, too.

247
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.400
There’s a lot being done to demonstrate
the “I’m not with they/them” mentality.

248
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.780
A hallmark of these fictional dystopian societies
is that you demonstrate your loyalty by condemning

249
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.780
others.

250
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.510
Which, as it so happens, is also how police
regimes like to function in real life.

251
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.850
There’s no better way to let everyone know
that you’re not a communist than if you

252
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.339
accuse all of your friends of secretly being
communists.

253
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:31.809
That being said, I’m not comparing the LGB
Alliance to this kind of painfully Orwellian

254
00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:33.060
YA dystopian genre.

255
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.730
As much as I feel like it’s a Machiavelli-esque
manual for identifying totalitarian control,

256
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.120
there are many who use 1984 to dog-whistle
the horrors of not being able to call people

257
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.840
slurs and get away with it anymore.

258
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.330
It’s referencing a very specific political
process that surely does not begin with the

259
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.419
public’s criticisms of stand-up comedians.

260
00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:55.990
At the same time that comedians justify their
loose lips as being the first and last lines

261
00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.669
of defence against totalitarianism, they go
around using their comedy to ridicule people

262
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:03.880
who are already targets of political talking
points.

263
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.900
Though I feel as if tentative rights and privileges
are being filtered to some of us in the queer

264
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.260
community, I’m beginning to see an unsettling
pattern from those of us who feel inclined

265
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.120
to… police the whole group.

266
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.600
My large concern comes from the… giddy,
enthusiastic willingness to partake in this

267
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.880
budding phase of state observationalism.

268
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.250
One side of the dualistic truth of human nature
really shines through when you have a group

269
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.890
of people whose identities were illegal in
some capacity and they win a campaign to earn

270
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.669
a second class citizen status and immediately
turn around and say: “OKAY!

271
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:39.110
Who do we get to torment now that we’re
at the grown-up table?”

272
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.700
The other side, the seemingly larger side,
believes you can make convincing arguments

273
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.100
to talk people out of an irrational power
trip.

274
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.220
Nothing is so tempting for people who have
lived under a thumb to get the chance to flex

275
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220
their own.

276
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.020
What better way is there to understand the
psychological inner workings of why someone

277
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.049
would participate in discriminatory groupthink
against you, than to participate in discriminatory

278
00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:01.679
groupthink which targets someone else?

279
00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:06.470
So enough beating around the bush — what
is going on here?

280
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:12.530
There is a large contingent of LGBT, etc people
who participate in the ongoing persecution

281
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.110
of various queer identities.

282
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.520
The fact that it’s happening so broadly
is more concerning than the fact that a bunch

283
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.470
of TERFs and has-been theatre queens are organising
online.

284
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.049
The purpose to this vocal protest of other
queer people is less about making any difference

285
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:29.070
or making any social change.

286
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.789
These people have what they want, they may
not want more, maybe they do — but their

287
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:36.919
objective is to protect what they have already
gotten.

288
00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:43.240
And in a misguided way, they feel that uniting
with the intolerant hegemony in hatred will

289
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.840
allow them to escape further discrimination.

290
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.060
As I don't join the hate myself, I can’t
really speak to the mechanics of it.

291
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:55.670
Is it more appropriate to say that these cis
Gs, Ls, and Bs see a friend in the enemy of

292
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.670
an enemy?

293
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.730
Or is it more about what they say about escaping
from bears?

294
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.480
That you don’t have to outrun the bear,
you just have to outrun your friends.

295
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.750
Because there’s a difference between running
away, and tripping your trans friend when

296
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.550
she starts to get into the clear.

297
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.049
Now really, there are enough of us running
from this bear that we can probably turn around

298
00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:18.570
and scream really loud until the bear decides
we’re more trouble than it’s worth.

299
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.940
God forbid anyone takes advice from a metaphor
though.

300
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:27.721
The vocalised mindset from anti-trans queer
folk is that things were going GREAT for the

301
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:31.919
L’s and G’s and B’s — that they had
everything they wanted.

302
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:36.800
Or at least there was forward momentum towards
progress (for them, of course) — it was

303
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.270
a delicate balance of accruing political and
social currency, and then trading it in for

304
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.540
strategically-decided rights and privileges.

305
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.020
The straights had gone to sleep about GAY
and LESBIAN issues… but they think that

306
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.539
trans people going for their rights is like
poking a sleeping tiger.

307
00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:57.270
The straight hegemony being both tigers and
bears in these scenarios because EVERYBODY’S

308
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.270
a fucking furry these days.

309
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.630
The thing that I think is so spineless about
LGB ideology is that it’s not made out of

310
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.039
any stance on belief, but a desperate attempt
to save face and GROVEL.

311
00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:12.110
“We’re actually DIFFERENT from them, so
we don’t care what happens to them, just

312
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.680
please please don’t take away the sorry
excuse for straight privilege that we’ve

313
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680
already gotten.”

314
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.740
The only instance of grovelling that I can
ever respect is when it involves a safe word.

315
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.500
This doesn’t really manifest in contacting
a secret police to have people taken away

316
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500
for being trans

317
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.559
(yet)

318
00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:31.690
but it does betray a mentality that people
in the overarching queer community are more

319
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.400
than willing to throw each other under the
bus for the purpose of maintaining what privilege

320
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.700
has already been gotten.

321
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.940
Of course, the real problem is the fact that
there is a hungry lion, or tiger, or bear

322
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.820
— your friends are not the enemy.

323
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.040
Instead of doing something about the beast,
we’d rather just feed our friends to it.

324
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.000
How does the thought cross your mind that
the wild animal will never eat you?

325
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
What?

326
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.779
As long as you keep feeding your friends to
it?

327
00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:59.919
Keep it full so it thinks you're an ally?

328
00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:03.130
What happens when you have no more friends
to feed to it?

329
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.799
Can you really say it’s a good idea to stake
your public acceptance on your ability to

330
00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:18.170
offer up victims to a bully?

331
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.970
This is less about… reasoning with this
mindset because I don’t actually think that

332
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.820
reasoning with them accomplishes anything.

333
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.820
“Oh SNAP.

334
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.370
John Stewart OWNED a conservative on gun regulation
laws!”

335
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.140
Sure, Him, yes, but also hundreds of other
pundits, commenters, politicians, celebrities,

336
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.539
and social theorists.

337
00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:38.279
If ‘owning’ anybody in an argument was
really going to result in a tangible effect

338
00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:41.810
on a social landscape, it would have happened
by now.

339
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.290
Gone are the days of Fred Rogers appealing
to congress for ongoing government funding

340
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.200
for PBS, holding congresspeople enwrapped
with a detailed argument of why public television

341
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.370
is so significant.

342
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:56.529
Arguably, the last time anybody in a position
of power actually *listened* to a testimonial

343
00:22:56.529 --> 00:23:00.419
was Frank Zappa’s testimonial about the
slippery slope of censoring song lyrics in

344
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:01.650
the 1980s.

345
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:07.410
Nobody LISTENS to arguments anymore, and that
extends now to people on social media.

346
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.720
I’m afraid that very few people have the
views they do because they’ve actually thought

347
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.480
about them, weighed the arguments internally,
and decided upon a set of values.

348
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.669
If I’m being cynical, many people seem to
propagate their views because they were either

349
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:24.690
conditioned into them by family values, or
because they want to emulate a public figure

350
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.690
that they like.

351
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.640
And that can include people who lean into
the collection of values which we label with

352
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.360
the abstract concept of ‘the left.’

353
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.230
That said, people who have reasoned through
their values tend to lean towards the left

354
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.230
anyway.

355
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.830
Who would have thought that members of a species
that owes its survival and global dominance

356
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:47.500
to cooperation and cohabitation would rationalise
their way into political compassion?

357
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:53.990
It’s almost like primates thrive because
of social cohesion and liberal omnisexualuty.

358
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.330
The point of arguing a side of the false dichotomy
that is political left versus political right

359
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.811
is less to actually convince people of values
one way or the other.

360
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:06.960
The reason people commit to these bombastic
displays of tweet threads or tic-toc call-out

361
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.890
videos is to signal what side of the debate
you are on.

362
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.870
And even if arguments are made to be directed
at the other side, the bulk of what they accomplish

363
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.110
is just reinforcing the values of people who
already agree with them.

364
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:26.590
Paraphrasing Noam Chomsky, he once said that
anyone who asks you to explain something quickly

365
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.970
is asking you to explain something they already
agree with.

366
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.220
Any number of minute long tic-toc videos is
not going to convince someone to abandon a

367
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.960
lifetime of social and intellectual conditioning.

368
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.680
In the same way, a tic-toc trying to explain
why the Hunger Games is actually about a socialist

369
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.679
dictatorship is just going to piss me off.

370
00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:50.240
We may say: “Well that’s because the concept
is completely irrational and indicative of

371
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.799
poor media literacy skills.”

372
00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:52.799
Which may be true.

373
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:55.270
But it’s not ABOUT “rational.”

374
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.940
In this instance, the Hunger Games is about
a collectivist society that chooses compassion

375
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.280
and freedom instead of tyranny.

376
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.610
Of course anyone who feels like their social
values are not being represented are going

377
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.360
to identify with this story.

378
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.720
They will start with the conclusion, and selectively
draw parallels where it suits their argument,

379
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.240
and ignore anything that does not support
their views.

380
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.690
Honestly, the capitol is indicative of many
things the right accuses the left of propagating.

381
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.890
Queer-coded, sensitive, sexual predators who
force others to be furries to befit fetishization.

382
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:31.000
Granted, that is a kind of satire all in itself
— escalating a perceived world state to

383
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.500
the point of parody.

384
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.899
Confronting the audience to look at how absurd
what you are saying is — and also look at

385
00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:40.300
how that’s absolutely NOT happening.

386
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.909
Granted in this genre of Dystopia, the objective
is to caution the audience about what COULD

387
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:48.520
be, provided we do not course-correct our
society.

388
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.660
It’s also just not how you’re supposed
to read the Hunger Games.

389
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.730
It’s about rich people going out of control
— which is a hallmark of…

390
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.550
Reganistic de-regulated corporatism.

391
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:03.010
You gotta think: which political institution
is actively advocating for people to get THIS

392
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.370
kind of rich?

393
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.059
Is it the AOCs of the world, who wanna tax
rich people?

394
00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:10.580
No.

395
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.580
No It is not.

396
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.850
Still though, we are allowed to be upset at
the perhaps intentional conflation of oppressive

397
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.039
opulence with queer aesthetics.

398
00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:23.350
The wealthy haven’t had aesthetics that
strong since France circa 1700.

399
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.620
Which was likely where the aesthetic direction
was drawn from.

400
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.450
But the antagonistic elements of the Hunger
Games and No.6 are not the specific power

401
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:35.130
figures enforcing these values — the revolting
part of these stories (regardless of how they

402
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:41.130
are interpreted) is a comfortable class of
people who exist in tandem with an underclass

403
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.399
who, in spite of their suffering, are entirely
ignored.

404
00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:48.730
The weird thing that you can only RARELY get
out of fiction (insofar as this parallel applies

405
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:54.060
to *queerdom*) is that after the whole bunch
of us spent centuries under the boot, we have

406
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.040
an internal social structure that is DESPERATELY
trying to participate in this persecution

407
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.450
dynamic now.

408
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:06.910
While at the SAME TIME this self-perceived
upper-crust of LGBs insist upon their ongoing

409
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.279
persecution under the hetero-hegemony.

410
00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:16.200
Thing is, it would be incredibly easy for
me to make an argument that would ‘own’

411
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.400
the LGB Alliance.

412
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.500
I wouldn’t be the only one, for sure.

413
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.070
And it is tempting, because who doesn’t
love to win an argument?

414
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.700
The argument against them is so easy because
these beliefs are irrational, but the thing

415
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.450
is… they want you to point out how irrational
it is.

416
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:33.000
Because THEN they can take that debate, and
run to the straight people they’re begging

417
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.500
for validity from and say:

418
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.600
“Look at how MEAN those trans supporters
are!

419
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.429
Cancel culture pipeline!”

420
00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:44.740
This discrimination of trans people within
the gay and lesbian communities is not rational:

421
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.690
bigotry in general rarely is.

422
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:52.190
Failing any reasoning, the self needs to preserve
its expected lifestyle and level of comfort.

423
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:58.690
They resort to emotional argumentation because
that’s more effective to accrue social currency

424
00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:59.760
as a victim.

425
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.929
The process of discriminating against others
in the hopes of going unnoticed by persecution

426
00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:06.179
is an act of self-diminishment.

427
00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:12.880
It’s acknowledging that persecution exists,
but that the better thing to do is to go unnoticed,

428
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.780
let it pass by, and target others.

429
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.940
Nobody who does that is standing for anything.

430
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:22.929
At best it’s negligent and ignorant; at
worst it’s malicious and cowardly.

431
00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:26.539
Turning away from the suffering of others
with the express intent of preserving your

432
00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:33.210
own privilege is the exact foundation of literally
every dystopian future that fiction provides.

433
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.120
Even ‘robots taking over the world’ futures
normally begin with humanity taking to violence

434
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.830
against artificial intelligence.

435
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:43.870
The society that exists in No.6 is one which
depends on affording a certain amount of privileges

436
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.590
to a select amount of people.

437
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.940
In a real-world application, the state only
needs to afford privileges to a bare minimum

438
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.950
of citizens to control the narrative.

439
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.380
If *enough* people buy into the State’s
mandate, the people themselves will silence

440
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.130
all those who disagree.

441
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.930
Because who doesn’t like a little privilege?

442
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.110
And then the narrative switches from *the
people* justifying their own rights, to the

443
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.840
narrative that privileges were bestowed upon
them by a benevolent authority.

444
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.500
Not enough people participating in privilege
will simply result in the authority losing

445
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.559
control in a game of numbers.

446
00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:18.510
Too many people participating in privilege
will decrease the political control that authority

447
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.909
can have — which is good for the comfortable
chaos of a people’s democracy.

448
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:28.080
Bad for an oligarchy who wants to pilot a
nation for the benefit of a select few in

449
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.830
the higher echelons of society.

450
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:35.760
And what it really comes down to is a group
of people who desperately think they can make

451
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.620
the cut when it comes to dolling out privilege.

452
00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.470
Even more so for people who already got a
taste.

453
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.470
But really…

454
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.020
Does the thought process really work like
that?

455
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.970
Do we really think that upon the vanquishing
of trans rights, the hetero-hegemony will

456
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.679
join hands with their gay, lesbian, and bisexual
brethren and let them raise children together

457
00:29:56.679 --> 00:29:58.110
in neatly divided suburbs?

458
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:03.250
I could talk about why queers policing other
queers is clownish and cowardly on the merits

459
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:07.690
of a once-persecuted class carrying out an
agenda of persecution in the hopes that they

460
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.960
will be spared the rod.

461
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.179
But if you already feel that way, I can’t
foresee any moral argument swaying your opinion.

462
00:30:15.179 --> 00:30:18.570
There is a face to step on if there are people
beneath you.

463
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:23.320
I guess stepping on people is more important
than not getting stepped on, yourself.

464
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.210
But if the objective IS making the world a
better place — what kind of world are these

465
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:39.330
values and sentiments contributing to.

466
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:43.160
The problem with a massive amount of ‘overthrow
the government’ literature is that there

467
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.169
is extreme, and perhaps deliberate vaguary
when it comes to what this governmental platform

468
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:49.169
is.

469
00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:53.149
And the problem with US, as an audience, is
that we are obsessed with the misguided notion

470
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:57.059
that our politics exist as a binary between
two political parties on a spectrum.

471
00:30:57.059 --> 00:31:01.710
We’re too busy trying to search for clues
about whether Panem is a political left or

472
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:07.059
political right so that we can act as party-affiliated
watchdogs to accuse other political affiliations

473
00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:09.640
of resembling a fictional character…

474
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640
or Hitler.

475
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.220
Which, unfortunately, we have to leave Godwin’s
law behind in the bin because.

476
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.220
American Nazis.

477
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.910
Meanwhile, we ignore the fact that these warning
signs are RIGHT IN FRONT OF US, and waste

478
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.290
our time trying to JUSTIFY our political ideology
by claiming that the opposition resembles

479
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.700
comic book villains.

480
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.970
Because we are that married to the use of
fiction to justify real-world feelings.

481
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:38.200
Regardless of the fact that in our attempt
to prevent ‘the other guys’ from doing

482
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.620
totalitarianism, we’re ignoring the pattern
that this just seems to be what any unregulated

483
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.070
government will do.

484
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.740
Especially when we’re too busy with macro-political
party lines to pay attention to the minutiae

485
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.970
of governance.

486
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.280
The government is like a dead frog.

487
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.030
Unless we, the people, poke it to make it
do things, it will just lay there, bloating,

488
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.780
and doing everything it can to justify its
own existence.

489
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:06.279
Though unlike the frog, a runaway government
is alive enough to fight for its survival.

490
00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:11.500
The purpose of democracy is to shift political
decision making from the elite, to be in the

491
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.840
hands of the people.

492
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.679
Ideally, we shouldn’t ‘depend’ on the
government to take any action about anything

493
00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:21.650
because the power to act lies with the people.

494
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.340
Granted that’s… a hell of a rose-tinted
idea of democracy.

495
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.639
But it’s concerning to me that I see more
and more people in America expecting executive

496
00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:33.929
action, when American Democracy is also alleged
to be one of the greatest examples of democracy

497
00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:34.929
in the world.

498
00:32:34.929 --> 00:32:38.380
And as a person who does not live in America,
I’m seeing a lot of people expecting their

499
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.160
government to work the same way, where the
head of the federal government is expected

500
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.070
to be able to ‘do things’ on a whim.

501
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.930
In reality, the political ideologies of these
fictional dystopian governments is irrelevant.

502
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.570
Boiling it down to ‘this happens in extreme
CAPITALIST governments’ or ‘that happens

503
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.770
in extreme COMMUNIST governments’ is missing
the point.

504
00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.610
The point is that the people of this nation
have allowed their government to consolidate

505
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.950
power to the point where it is almost entirely
removed from the people.

506
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.870
For those who can keep their head down and
toe the line, this is fine.

507
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.740
But there’s never going to be a situation
where everyone in a culture can exist as the

508
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.870
archetype of the government’s model citizen.

509
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.100
Luckily, the state has a solution for dissidents.

510
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:24.659
Everyone who can’t toe the line also has
a role to serve to the State: as an example

511
00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:27.680
of what happens to those who do not conform.

512
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.450
It saddens me to say that in the queer community,
after winning a cultural war justifying that

513
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:41.210
queer love is not a choice, some of us are
trying to label others’ identities as choices.

514
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.340
I do want to be clear that I’m using an
Orwellian comparison a little flippantly.

515
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.970
These days you get any assortment of people
who, at the first sign of any kind of social

516
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.570
decency, will resort to a 1984 comparison.

517
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:59.610
It also doesn’t help that Orwell rooted
his story in a totalitarian Communist regime.

518
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.610
Kind of.

519
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.340
The key factor about 1984 is that the people
are kept ignorant of how their government

520
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.710
actually worked.

521
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.929
Details about distant or recent history are
also kept obscure — and these obfuscating

522
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.710
factors increased with each generation.

523
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.710
Huh…

524
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.940
Texas and Florida are doing away with a lot
of school history books.

525
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:24.409
1984 was scary because, so I am told, there
is nothing in that novel that was strictly

526
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.409
fictitious.

527
00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:30.480
But then again, the combination of all these
real-world political suppression tactics benefits

528
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.800
a very specific kind of sensibility.

529
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.290
If it’s not indicative of this kind of totalitarian
dystopia, then it should signal to you that

530
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:43.440
if (or when) this DOES happen, a line is drawn
between those who will beg to be welcomed

531
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.470
into it, and those who cannot or will not
conform.

532
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:52.869
The ease with which many gay men and women
come to discriminate against so many others

533
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:59.250
should be a red flag because it clearly outlines
a willingness to participate in this KIND

534
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.270
of totalitarian regime.

535
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:06.640
As with the Twinks for Trump kind of movements,
there’s a mindset that if we adapt the mentality

536
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.610
of the bigoted oppressors that the oppressors
will recognize us as ‘worthy.’

537
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.280
You, of the LGB Alliance, may throw out some
defences saying

538
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.560
‘I don’t want trans people to be eradicated’

539
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.560
‘something something —

540
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.670
‘difference of opinions’

541
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.670
— something —

542
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.670
‘i’m just uncomfortable’ —

543
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.670
Something.’

544
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.280
However, the language you are projecting to
the world is literally “they/them are not

545
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.520
with us.”

546
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.230
And by perpetuating that you deserve your
own rights and privileges because of your

547
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.880
separation from trans people and others, you
are ALSO saying:

548
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.040
“I’m cool if you do whatever you want
with them.”

549
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.170
You are acknowledging that hate and bigotry
exist within the system but doing nothing

550
00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.579
to challenge it.

551
00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:49.960
And rather than change the system, you are
not only siding with it, but being willing

552
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.270
to sacrifice your freedoms to do it.

553
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.569
Yes, freedom.

554
00:35:55.569 --> 00:36:00.640
You are pressuring a government to have the
power to decide who is or is not a person.

555
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.609
Almost… immediately after the government
decided that you were a person, so back up

556
00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:06.609
a little bit.

557
00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:14.700
How can a government which decides who is
or is not a person possibly have any kind

558
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:25.820
of role in freedom?

559
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:31.400
The stupid idea isn’t this roundabout argument
that trans people fighting for trans rights

560
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.040
will somehow put a crosshair on cis gay men
and women.

561
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.830
Because, quite frankly, that’s probably
true.

562
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:41.470
And we need to confront that, and acknowledge
that putting ourselves at risk to close ranks

563
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:47.770
and advocate for what the whole of us needs
— is more important than hiding in a fantasy

564
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.339
world where everything is coming up roses
for the gays.

565
00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:55.750
Because we do need to confront this uncomfortable
truth that standing together as a community

566
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.430
comes with a possible threat.

567
00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:03.880
But that threat isn’t coming from people
who love you, it's coming from people who

568
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.079
tolerate you.

569
00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:10.780
They wish you and your gay ass weren’t around,
weren’t on their favourite TV shows, but

570
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.380
they’ll TOLERATE it.

571
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:19.000
And this community, every letter in the goddamn
alphabet, has been through too much to simply

572
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.030
be tolerated.

573
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:26.800
Let’s face it — if some people being who
they truly are without hurting anyone is all

574
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.499
that it takes for the freedom-brokers of the
world to revoke your legal status as a person

575
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:36.440
— chances are that your rights aren’t
as secure as you think.

576
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:42.369
And that shouldn’t make you feel defeated
— that should inspire you to work to finish

577
00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:44.290
the job.

578
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.240
And certainly… examine the philosophical
conflict of interest in fighting for your

579
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.819
own rights by preventing others from getting
theirs.

580
00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:58.089
We either all deserve rights, or we open the
door to a debate on who is or isn’t a person.

581
00:37:58.089 --> 00:38:06.839
If more people seeking rights is going to
jeopardise your own rights — why does that

582
00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:12.819
direct your anger at the people seeking rights,
and not at the people who give the rights

583
00:38:12.819 --> 00:38:15.880
out like gold stars for good behaviour?

584
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.800
He who giveth can taketh away.

585
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.350
And this fantasy world of everything being
awesome for the gays is at odds with the awareness

586
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.310
that rights could and CAN vanish.

587
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:31.540
It’s *this* fear that’s fuelling the hatred:
hatred is learned behaviour.

588
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.720
And it’s the desperate need to cling to
this rose-tinted world of mimosas and post

589
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.089
VH1 drag-race — this world where the gays
have won everything they could ever want — that

590
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:44.060
is generating this fear of losing it all.

591
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.420
We’re so desperate to not return to our
darkest days that some of us are trying to

592
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.380
keep others in them.

593
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:55.210
We take the side of the hatemongers who, within
even my living memory, were responsible for

594
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.750
our bleakest moments.

595
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.619
It’s easy to channel fear into hate.

596
00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:05.030
If you fear losing what you have, you will
hate those who (you perceive) may take it

597
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.030
from you.

598
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:11.079
Though the characters in works like 1984 are
tragic, a solution to totalitarian control

599
00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:12.820
is offered.

600
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.080
Big brother’s control is predicated on the
ability to restrict love and sex, and redirect

601
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.670
it into feverish devotion for the party.

602
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.560
In light of everyone obsessing over everything
else in 1984, I am most concerned that this

603
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.770
detail in particular is going unspoken.

604
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:33.810
However, while Orwell’s focus was on sex
and romance, and while his protagonists themselves

605
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:38.930
are flawed and single-minded, I feel there
is a rather glaring extension to the kind

606
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.880
of love that is needed to push back against
control and regime.

607
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.450
Why just romantic love?

608
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.069
Why not the love for a community?

609
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:47.069
A culture?

610
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:48.069
A nation?

611
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:52.300
The love of a stranger who is doing what they
love — what they were never told to do,

612
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.510
but they do anyway.

613
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.819
A love for recognizing someone living their
best life, for knowing that even if you are

614
00:39:57.819 --> 00:40:02.210
in hard times, you can rest assured that your
best life is still out there.

615
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:06.770
Love in the literal sense of appreciating
another human being because you recognize

616
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:12.120
that the humanity in them is the very same
as the humanity in you.

617
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.130
Love in the abstract sense of appreciating
a world for which any explanation for our

618
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.579
existence is a spectacle.

619
00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:22.410
And that there is no way to appreciate the
people in this world — for all the ways

620
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:26.910
that they are the same through hate and fear.

621
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:35.950
Love is a shift in your energy and loyalty
to the subject of your attention.

622
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:43.319
The state cannot control what you love, because
*you* have no control over what you love either.

623
00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:49.720
So the hallmark of control is being told what
to fear — and what to hate.

624
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.290
Who is your enemy.

625
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.870
Not who is your friend.

626
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.410
But whose the real enemy?

627
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.849
The person threatening to take your rights
away?

628
00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:04.050
Or the person simply asking to be treated
with respect.

629
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:44.960
I know who my enemy is.

630
00:41:44.960 --> 00:43:01.090
Do you?
