00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
For anyone who has followed my channel for
any amount of time, and certainly anyone who

2
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.260
follows me on Twitter or watches my live streams,
it won’t come as any shock that Harry Potter

3
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.060
was a formative piece of media for me.

4
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.410
And I also might be one of the cisgender men
who is most enraged by Harry Potter’s author,

5
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.220
JK Rowling, and her… presumably…

6
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.340
recent fall into Trans Exclusionary Radical
Feminism.

7
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.770
She has spent the last several years honing
her cruceatus curse on the trans community

8
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.780
around the globe.

9
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.200
But especially trans women in the UK.

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.710
She doesn’t often speak of trans men but
don’t worry, when she does, her talking

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.370
points are just as backward as when she talks
about trans women.

12
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.589
The situation has grown ever more fraught
since her first ‘middle-aged moment’ tweets

13
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.700
in June of 2020.

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.049
Now this is the point in the video when someone
will jump down to the comments with the: “Tell

15
00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.060
me what she said that’s transphobic.

16
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.080
Tell me what she’s done.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.050
None of you people can seem to tell me.”

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.340
I’ve seen so many comments like this that
it's literally become a joke.

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.240
But luckily people actually HAVE cataloged
what she’s done.

20
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.420
And I could leave links in the description
to articles that line these out, but we all

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.920
know they won’t read them, so forgive me
for using Abby Gardner’s breakdown from

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890
glamour.com as my jumping off point here.

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
But first, I want to say that this video is
brought to you by my patrons.

24
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.030
YouTube has been in a mood lately and isn’t
even notifying subscribers who click the bell

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.860
when a new video comes out, so the views and
Adsense for this channel have sucked lately.

26
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.270
So its really thanks to our patrons that we
can keep this channel going.

27
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.740
Without them we would have had to stop a long
time.

28
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.560
So if you like the videos we make, and have
the means, even a dollar or two a month, I

29
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.590
would be so grateful if you signed up for
our Patreon, linked in the description.

30
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.790
Patrons gain access to videos early, plus
behind the scenes clips, a weekly podcast,

31
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
movie watch a long parties, not-so-youtube-safe
versions of videos, and a lot more.

32
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.370
So if you’re able to support the channel
this way, I couldn’t thank you enough.

33
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.270
And if you’re not able to, which is very
understandable in this economy, likes, comments

34
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.680
and shares go a long long way.

35
00:02:32.680 --> 00:03:15.620
Now back to Joanne.

36
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.170
On June 6 of the cursed year of 2020, Joanne
tweeted out an article from devex.com calling

37
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.439
for a more equal world post covid 19.

38
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.640
Specifically for people who menstruate.

39
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:42.200
She took issue with the term “People who
menstruate”, tweeting:

40
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.150
This is just one of the many instances of
Joanne erasing trans men and non-binary people

41
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.600
from her gilded little world.

42
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.890
Notwithstanding the massive backlash she received
after the original tweet, when she could have

43
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.580
thought about what she said and fixed this
whole issue before it took over so much of

44
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:48.850
our lives, she went on to elaborate on her
beliefs in a longer piece.

45
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.220
First of all, this is tangential to a kind
of academic gaslighting.

46
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.419
She’s trying to convince you that two things
are self-evident that aren’t necessarily

47
00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.419
related.

48
00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.510
In the fight for trans rights — nobody is
really trying to argue that sex doesn’t

49
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.660
exist in order to justify the existence of
GENDER.

50
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.700
She’s trying to gaslight gay men and women
into being on her side with the ‘there’s

51
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.060
no same sex attraction’ bit.

52
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.300
Guess what, Joanne, you can be gay and still
be attracted to trans or non-binary people.

53
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.810
I know, we must all be drinking crazy juice.

54
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.410
But as a very much confirmed gay man if someone
told me I couldn’t be attracted to Laith

55
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.570
Ashley because he’s trans, I’d tell them
to sod off.

56
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.570
Second of all!

57
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.789
“Empathetic to trans people… because they’re
vulnerable in the same way as women.”

58
00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.320
Trans women are women, Joanne.

59
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.490
They don’t share a few things in common
with women.

60
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.169
They don’t just happen to look like women.

61
00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.520
They are women.

62
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.880
She continued:

63
00:05:46.880 --> 00:06:14.070
Trans women’s lives have also been shaped
by being women.

64
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.389
Ask any trans woman how much she’s gone
through to be accepted as a woman by even

65
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.000
a fraction of the population.

66
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.990
If that process doesn’t shape the way a
person exists, I don’t know what does.

67
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.669
On June 10, 2020 Joanne published an essay
length blog on her website called “TERF

68
00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:37.669
Wars”.

69
00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:44.009
Now I’m not going to break down that tirade
because I enjoy having a modicum of sanity

70
00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:50.790
left, But in the piece she defended her defense
of Maya Forstater, who Joanne said “lost

71
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.280
her job for what were deemed ‘transphobic’
tweets.”

72
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.660
This is actually incorrect.

73
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.729
Forstater’s contract was up for renewal
at the time and it was simply not renewed.

74
00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:02.970
This happens all the time.

75
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.979
Whenever you sign an employment contract for
a set number of days, usually amounting to

76
00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:14.970
one or two years, your employer can choose
not to renew that contract for any reason

77
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.830
they see fit, or for no reason at all.

78
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.259
But instead of taking the work experience
and finding another job, Forstater went on

79
00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:29.750
a crusade that she has since turned into an
enterprise, in lieu of actually advancing

80
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.760
her original career.

81
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.600
Turns out it pays to be bigoted…

82
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.220
To this very day she goes around blaming every
bad thing in the world on trans people.

83
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.630
If you’ve got the stomach for it, go look
at her Twitter account.

84
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.009
It’s bonkers.

85
00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.410
So after TERF WARS came out is when many public
figures and celebrities, including the younger

86
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.169
cast members of Harry Potter, came out firmly
against Joanne’s seemingly sudden lurch

87
00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.099
into exclusionary politics.

88
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:58.980
Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were the
loudest voices among them.

89
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.470
And this is when the Joanne simps started
up the online chants of “You wouldn’t

90
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.040
have anything without her!”

91
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.500
Essentially saying they never would have become
famous actors were it not for her choosing

92
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500
them.

93
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.520
Not taking into account that thousands of
child actors were run through casting directors

94
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.240
before their faces ever appeared in front
of Joanne.

95
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.371
Nevermind that the Harry Potter movies may
never have become the success they did without

96
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:24.150
the charismatic young actors at the center
of them.

97
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:30.430
Them daring to disagree with her at all was
tantamount to kicking her in the mud, spitting

98
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.260
on her, and then running her over with a high
speed broomstick.

99
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.880
Also last year Tom Felton, who played Draco
Malfoy in the movies, published his autobiography,

100
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.230
in which he said Joanne “wasn’t part of
the filmmaking process as much as some people

101
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.600
might think.”

102
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.160
So let’s not give her too much credit for
the movies, most of which are nonsensical

103
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.350
if you haven't read the books anyway.

104
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:59.110
(It was probably after this that Joanne actually
head-cannoned an adult Draco Malfoy into going

105
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.580
around Diagon Alley Shops and vandalizing
them with messages of supporting trans rights.

106
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.959
She literally did that.

107
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:07.959
Look it up.

108
00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:08.959
She did that.

109
00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:11.130
She did.)

110
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.670
Another voice that got pulled into the cacophony
was Stephen King, who retweeted a tweet from

111
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.440
Rowling’s twitter stating that sometimes
men try to silence women with violence.

112
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.640
Which Is a pretty true and broadly known fact.

113
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.300
King has written several books about women
who are abused, either physically or psychologically,

114
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.540
by the men in their lives.

115
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.490
Rowling tweeted out a glowing message about
King thanking him for agreeing with her.

116
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:38.089
When a fan asked King what he thought about
trans rights, and he replied by saying, “Trans

117
00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:43.500
women are women,” Rowling deleted the tweet
in which she praised him.

118
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.320
King later told an interviewer that Joanne
actually blocked him after that.

119
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.810
Because she’s as petty as an eighth grader.

120
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.990
July 5, 2020.

121
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.980
Rowling goes on another tweet tirade.

122
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:09.160
Pulling a tactic from the Fox News playbook:

123
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:33.830
Now, I know a fair number of trans people,
both men and women, and they all have different

124
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.120
transition journeys.

125
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.180
But one thing they all seem to have in common
is that getting the hormones and gender affirming

126
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.230
care they need can be like climbing mount
Everest in heels with a blindfold on.

127
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.920
Certainly not the first thing the doctor offers
for, like, anything, let alone gender dysphoria.

128
00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:11.639
She continued by saying:

129
00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:15.300
Acting like there’s an epidemic of de-transitioning
going on is dumb.

130
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.670
People do de-transition, its true.

131
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.500
Sometimes it’s for medical reasons, sometimes
its social pressure, and sometimes they really

132
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.070
do come to the conclusion that this isn’t
who they are.

133
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.360
But the amount of people who detransition,
for any reason, is a fraction of a fraction

134
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.320
of a fraction of the women who choose to have
their breast implants removed, or the people

135
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.110
who decide to have weight loss surgeries reversed.

136
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.890
Context is important.

137
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:51.720
And then then called into question the use
of hormones 

138
00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:08.090
in general.

139
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:29.910
And then Her re-tweet of this gem.

140
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.640
First of all, antidepressants should never
be a last resort.

141
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.070
If someone is horribly depressed Its safer
to medicate them while going through therapy

142
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.070
then having them spend months in therapy just
to never be able to medicate them because

143
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.130
they take their own lives.

144
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:48.320
I had a good friend in high school who was
in that situation and, sadly, he’s not here

145
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.690
anymore.

146
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.449
So watch what you say about therapy and medication.

147
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:59.820
Second, the quote “Pure laziness for those
who would rather medicate than put in the

148
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:06.019
time and effort to heal people's minds' ' really
does come across as saying unless there’s

149
00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:11.970
no way to convince you that you’re not trans,
then we’ll let you have hormones.

150
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.020
Which sounds an AWFUL LOT like conversion
therapy to me.

151
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.570
Which, sadly, doesn’t shock me anymore since
the pseudonym Joanne uses to write her over-written

152
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.560
detective novels is the same name of the man
who created conversion therapy.

153
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.500
She says it’s a coincidence.

154
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.960
But was she really dumb enough to choose a
fake author name without googling it first?

155
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.910
Well, maybe, but I’ll actually give her
some credit here and say she IS smart enough

156
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.910
to do that.

157
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.350
She just chose the name on purpose.

158
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.860
Speaking of that psydonum.

159
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.110
On September 14, 2020, when early reviews
of her latest bloated, obviously editor-free

160
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.480
detective novel started making the rounds,
another round of controversy was triggered.

161
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.430
The plot of the novel centers on a detective
who is tasked with finding a cis male serial

162
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.480
killer who dresses as a woman in order to
stalk and kill cis women.

163
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.940
Now of course, trans women are not just men
in dresses.

164
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.579
But she seems to think they are, so it's quite
clear that she was using the doorstop sized

165
00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:17.970
tome to demonize trans women as being dangerous
to cis women.

166
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:23.430
It’s easy enough to extrapolate that is
her saying that trans women are dangerous

167
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:31.970
to cis women IN GENERAL, instead of just the
special and rare instances of serial killers.

168
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:39.089
And then In August of last year she started
promoting her newest transphobia-laced detective

169
00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:43.450
novel under the name of the man who created
conversion therapy, The Ink Black Heart.

170
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.570
In it, A YouTube-based cartoonist is doxxed,
threatened, and ultimately stabbed to death

171
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.580
in a cemetery.

172
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:56.680
The cartoonist's work is accused of being
racist, ableist, and drumroll please… transphobic.

173
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.790
In the opinion of one reviewer, the book “takes
aim” at “social justice warriors.”

174
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.839
But Rowling swore up and down that the book
was not based on the threats she had received

175
00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:08.190
on Twitter, such as being doxxed.

176
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.430
If you don’t know what doxxing is, it is
“the action or process of searching for

177
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.310
and publishing private or identifying information
about a particular individual on the internet,

178
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.139
typically with malicious intent.”

179
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:23.300
But It's hard to publish identifying information
about a woman who has been in the public eye

180
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:29.089
for the last twenty years and lives in a Scottish
castle, the address of which was listed LONG

181
00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:33.320
before this due to its status as a heritage
site.

182
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.140
So that’s the timeline of events that lead
to many people, myself included, believing

183
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.320
that Joanne Rowling, author of the globally
bestselling children’s fantasy book series

184
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.620
about a boy wizard who was raised in a closet
and grew up to become a cop… that states

185
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.139
that enslaved house elves actually like being
enslaved, and that everyone who wants to change

186
00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:58.670
the status quo is a villain… is actually
a bit of a regressive transphobe.

187
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.490
Now what about the damn video game?

188
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.870
Full disclosure, a marketing firm working
with Avalanche Studios, the company behind

189
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.200
the video game Hogwarts Legacy, sent me a
review copy of the game.

190
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.760
Which I did attempt to play.

191
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.880
But maybe it needed a day one patch or something
because the review copy’s controls were

192
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.560
so wonky, and the voice over so disjointed
from the mouth movement that I couldn’t

193
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:25.509
play the thing for maybe 90 minutes before
giving up and playing The Last of Us remake.

194
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:28.029
So this is not a review of the game.

195
00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:32.329
Which, considering they didn’t send the
game out to actual review sites who they thought

196
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:37.269
wouldn’t be kind, I’m kind of shocked
as hell that they sent it to me.

197
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:41.990
I can’t even get my favorite queer authors
to send me early reader copies of their books,

198
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.839
but likely the biggest game of the year gets
sent to me?

199
00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:49.690
After publishing two videos and countless
live streams in which I rail against Joanne

200
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:50.690
and her broken ideology?

201
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.660
I feel like there’s a queer person working
at that marketing firm who was trying to sabotage

202
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660
it.

203
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.660
If so, good for you!

204
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.660
I hope you’re watching.

205
00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.660
But anyway.

206
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.380
For months and months before this game came
out… years, really.

207
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.130
The thing was announced forever ago…

208
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.230
people have been trying to build a boycott
of the game.

209
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.380
The main reason being its connection with
Rowling.

210
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.799
At least That’s the one all the news sites
have been running with.

211
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:17.650
“The crazy LGBTQLMNOP’s are boycotting
the wizard game for children!”

212
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.990
And if you’re watching the right channel,
they might even include a little tag about

213
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.010
grooming, because why the hell not?

214
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.329
But the queer community isn’t the only one
raising the warning flag when it comes to

215
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:27.329
Joanne’s work.

216
00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.960
There are plenty of people taking off the
rose tinted glasses we’ve been wearing since

217
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.960
discovering the series and finding things
that are all sorts of troubling.

218
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.200
There aren't many characters of color in the
novels, and the ones that are there are frequently

219
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.140
pushed to the background and given names that
are outrageously stereotypical.

220
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.100
For instance, Cho Chang is a character whose
primary attributes are that she’s good at

221
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.630
school, and she’s Asian.

222
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.100
That’s basically it.

223
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.270
But it’s not just characters of color.

224
00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:00.880
Look at Seamus Finnigan, whose portrayed as
dumb and constantly blowing things up.

225
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.360
Because, you know, he’s Irish.

226
00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.910
And in case you were unaware some Irish people
would like all of Ireland to be a unified

227
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.870
nation and not under the thumb of England.

228
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:15.990
See, beginning in 1970, the Irish Republican
Army,, or IRA, fighting for independence,

229
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:21.120
carried out assassinations, and ambushes in
a campaign they called the “Long War.”

230
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.340
Oh and Bombings.

231
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.370
They carried out bombings as well.

232
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.570
You know, blowing stuff up.

233
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.820
And her peculiar ideas on gender are made
clearly evident by the fact that magic stairs

234
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.450
prohibit guys from getting to the girls' dorm
but do not prevent girls from entering into

235
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.790
the boys' dorm.

236
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.150
And It's common practice to equate physical
attractiveness with goodness, while the ugliness

237
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.059
of villainous characters is repeatedly emphasized.

238
00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:48.870
Whether it be the over blown ugliness of the
death eaters, or Harry’s abusive aunt and

239
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.970
uncle respectively looking like a horse and
being morbidly obese.

240
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.970
And then…

241
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.730
there’s the Goblin bankers.

242
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.720
The movies created a much sharper image of
the Goblins than the books did, one that many

243
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.510
people identified with stereotypical Jewish
characteristics.

244
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.530
Physically the goblins are shown as having
huge hooked noses, and they control all the

245
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.950
money in the wizarding world.

246
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:14.559
Rowling has not acknowledged or apologized
for the purportedly inadvertent link despite

247
00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:19.380
the fact that it has been brought up countless
times by many different people.

248
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:27.830
I’m… disinclined to say that this is errant
anti semitism on her part, and more…

249
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.830
negligence?

250
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:35.620
The thing is that these are almost a direct
depiction of goblins as they exist in European

251
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.010
folklore, either in appearance or behavior.

252
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.700
Poet Christina Rosetti wrote the poem: Goblin
Market, where goblins are depicted as skeezy

253
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.870
merchants, or perhaps are an allegory for
opium pushers.

254
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.480
In the books, their appearance is less important
than the attitude about them, naturally.

255
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.539
And as being tight for cash — at one point
in her life — I can understand that J.K.

256
00:19:56.539 --> 00:20:00.410
Rowling may not want to depict bankers in
a positive light.

257
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.380
The movies, however, had no excuse to depict
them the way they did.

258
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.850
And the goblins in the parks have even LESS
of an excuse.

259
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:12.710
Now the reason why I say Rowling is guilty
of negligence is because Goblins, as a mythological

260
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.920
creature themselves, have roots in antisemitism.

261
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.210
Some stories tie the origin of goblins to
Judaism.

262
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:26.770
For instance, Cornish myths suggest that Knockers
(the Cornish form of goblins) came from the

263
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.200
spirits of Jews who worked in the Cornish
mines during the Middle ages.

264
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.659
But Because the notion that goblins being
based on the souls of Jews did not make sense

265
00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:40.630
in modern society, many of these tales about
goblins did not survive the transition into

266
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.850
modern society.

267
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:46.720
Yet that's not the whole story of where the
goblin came from.

268
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.059
Rabbi Jo David said:

269
00:20:50.059 --> 00:21:09.409
As 

270
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:13.909
an additional piece of historical context,
throughout the Middle Ages Jews were given

271
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:20.470
the job of working as bankers, tax collectors,
and in general dealing with money because

272
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:26.580
this was considered to be a job below that
of Crusaders and landowners.

273
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.679
And not jobs that were Christ-like.

274
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:34.179
And of course the N*z*s used goblin-like images
to portray Jews in all of their propaganda.

275
00:21:34.179 --> 00:21:38.730
So goblins are very deeply anchored in their
own history, and for many reasons, including

276
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.909
antisemitism, they frequently become associated
with Judaism; nonetheless, the question comes

277
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:45.890
back to purpose.

278
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.659
Did the author who came up with the original
story, J.K.

279
00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:54.929
Rowling, intend for the goblins to have qualities
that are often associated with Jews?

280
00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:58.070
Again, she hasn’t acknowledged the issue
so we don't know.

281
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.480
This leads to the problem with Hogwarts Legacy,
in which one of the primary villains, the

282
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.720
goblin Ranrok, is leading a Goblin rebellion
against the Wizarding World and collaborates

283
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.169
with some dark wizards to reach his goal.

284
00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:14.390
In the marketing, he was featured most prominently
with a line about kidnapping the 15-year-old

285
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.800
player character.

286
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.230
And so Ranrok has been labeled as a very evident
example of antisemitism.

287
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:27.720
Because one of the biggest antisemitic tropes
used to villainize Jews is Blood Libel, or

288
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.760
the accusation that Jews kidnapped and murdered
non-Jews in the past in order to use their

289
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.100
blood in Jewish rituals.

290
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.450
This one common sentiment has been a main
driving factor throughout the middle ages

291
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.510
and modern times to target and incite violence
against the Jewish people.

292
00:22:45.510 --> 00:23:12.540
Of this, Rabbi Kalev said:

293
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:26.850
The 

294
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.140
game even has a Goblin Rebellion that takes
place in the year 1612, and it turns out that

295
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:37.670
there was a real-life massacre that occurred
against Jewish people during the 1612 Feltmilth

296
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:38.710
uprising.

297
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.419
This massacre was one of many pogroms, or
strategically conducted attacks, that were

298
00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:47.230
carried out in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods
over the course of history.

299
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.900
The date seems to be too specific not to be
a reference to hate crimes committed against

300
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.840
Jews in the real world.

301
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.840
Hogwarts Legacy has, of course, sold a gazillion
copies already, and will likely end up, by

302
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.760
direct royalties, or further licensing agreements,
making JK Rowling richer than she already

303
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760
is.

304
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.260
She even brags about getting royalty checks
on Twitter now.

305
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.700
Because, again, she’s as petty as an eighth
grader.

306
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.880
I say ‘8th grader’ figuratively.

307
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.090
I’m sure many ankle-biters have more emotional
maturity than this woman is displaying.

308
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:23.460
Seeing how most of her tweeting and award-winning,
grammatically unstructured essay-ing is equivalent

309
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.250
to ’I’m rubber and you’re glue.’

310
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.250
.

311
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.809
But even with the success of the game making
her richer… does that even matter?

312
00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:35.130
Should we even care?

313
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.929
Now what I mean by that is…

314
00:24:37.929 --> 00:24:40.279
Rowling already has more money than god.

315
00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:43.240
She certainly has the martyrdom complex to
go with it…

316
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.279
Because of the way investments work, she’d
have to make a full time job of spending money

317
00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.049
to spend it fast enough to actually make a
dent in her bank account.

318
00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:55.190
As long as she doesn’t go buying up any
social media platforms, her personal equity

319
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.039
will grow — even without any deliberate
efforts to help it along.

320
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:03.730
Barring the complete dissolution of society
and abandonment of all major currencies, she’s

321
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.059
(likely) going to be richer than everyone
watching this video combined… forever.

322
00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:12.520
For any exceptions to that statement, the
link to my Patreon can be found below.]

323
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.419
There is no changing that.

324
00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:19.220
Boycotting a game or a movie or eventual TV
show will never hurt her bank balance.

325
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.650
Not in any significant way.

326
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.770
And certainly not in a way that matters to
her.

327
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.620
Even though Fantastic Beasts BOMBED, she’s
almost entirely unbothered.

328
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:33.380
The failure of the movies has not seemed to
affect or soften her stance on social issues.

329
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.140
Even if she financed an entire harry potter
movie HERSELF, whether it succeeds or not,

330
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.260
won’t change her spending (or hoarding)
of power.

331
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.929
Money seems to matter LESS to her than this
platform.

332
00:25:46.929 --> 00:25:48.110
Media boycotts never work.

333
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.850
I’ve seen boycotts against Brokeback Mountain
because it was gay, Star Wars because it had

334
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.440
a black male lead and a female co-lead (This
is when we thought john boyega would actually

335
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440
be a Jedi).

336
00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.510
People boycotted Captain Marvel because…
powerful women, and Beauty and the Beast for

337
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.870
having two gays spin in a circle for a few
frames.

338
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.940
But all of those movies made a fortune.

339
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.919
People have boycotted video games for being
racist, sexist, homophobic, you name it.

340
00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:12.630
But the games still go on to make a ton of
money for the studios.

341
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:18.230
There is no guarantee that a problem created
by capitalism can be solved… with more capitalism.

342
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.790
And choosing to withhold your financial support
for various services or goods for whatever

343
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.980
reason is still…

344
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.250
capitalism.

345
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.250
Boycotts are risky.

346
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.250
Very risky.

347
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.760
A boycott would hurt an independant caffe.

348
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.970
It would not — and has not — and will
not — hurt Starbucks.

349
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.340
For all the people you may get invested into
your boycott, a corporation has the capital

350
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.440
to launch a larger propaganda campaign to
peel ENOUGH people away from the boycott to

351
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.760
dismiss the loss of a handful of customers.

352
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.330
But especially because corporations aim to
reach as wide an audience as possible, a handful

353
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.590
of boycotters won’t make a difference.

354
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.220
As it stopped neither the Force Awakens nor
Captain Marvel from being mega hits.

355
00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:02.190
In fact, especially in the latter case, it
can be argued that boycotts can risk the opposite

356
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.370
effect happening.

357
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:09.690
Why did Captain Marvel make so MUCH more money
than Wonder Woman, when there was nobody particularly

358
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.830
boycotting DC’s effort?

359
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.049
Boycotts call to attention that somebody wants
this thing to fail.

360
00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:21.120
Which then pushes a lot of people who were
on the fence about something, to support it

361
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.710
out of spite.

362
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.140
Not to mention the free publicity that comes
from news coverage.

363
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.360
And then, not only does the thing you wanted
to fail do terribly well, but the creators

364
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.560
get to feel confident in their invulnerability.

365
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.299
Just as Captain Marvel memes made a point
of drinking ‘male tears’, those of us

366
00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:41.700
who supported the movie’s success established
the language that is used against us.

367
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.930
They are now drinking ‘leftist tears.’

368
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.790
Yes, it really is THAT kind of playground
politics.

369
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.740
We really are just a bunch of 8th-graders,
after all.

370
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.049
They’re humiliated when we drink their tears,
so they try extra hard to humiliate us by

371
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:55.440
drinking our tears.

372
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.350
Which means we try even harder to humiliate
them, which means they try even harder to

373
00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.960
humiliate us back.

374
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.049
It just goes around in circles.

375
00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:05.610
It ends up being that the point isn’t to
actually…

376
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.260
do anything — it just becomes about OWNING
the other group.

377
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:15.870
Which is how you end up with a bunch of people
who drop a cool $500 on buying multiple copies

378
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:21.070
of Hogwarts Legacy JUST to “own the libs,”
and not because they actually care about Harry

379
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.410
Potter or know anything to do with the debate.

380
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.169
It just becomes this peevish complex to ‘win.’

381
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:29.830
And this is a prize worth nothing anyway.

382
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.419
These little ‘victories’ mean nothing
and signify nothing — because the Billion

383
00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:38.019
Dollars Captain Marvel made certainly didn’t
indicate any good omens about the conditions

384
00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:40.180
of women's rights in America, did it?

385
00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.740
These culture wars using capitalism as a proxy
don’t — actually — mean the things we

386
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.299
want them to mean.

387
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:52.350
Because support of Hogwarts Legacy itself
was a bit of a proxy.

388
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.120
Before people even knew about the problematic
plot which amounts to heroically shutting

389
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.340
down a revolution in Scotland — people were
taking sides on a picket line over Rowlings’

390
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.110
then-recent descent into TERFism.

391
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.210
But what would have happened if the boycott
had worked?

392
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:13.110
Would the world have turned around and said:
“well I guess trans people DO deserve rights?”

393
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:19.059
People would stick their heels even deeper
in the mud.

394
00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:24.679
JK Rowling broadens her scope of attack to
blame Trans People or the whole LGBT community

395
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:27.700
for targeting her video game for children.

396
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.190
And then the news runs with ‘think of the
poor developers’, regardless of how many

397
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.409
of them got laid off the minute the game hit
shelves.

398
00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:39.360
British Media especially would run story after
story.

399
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.700
Rowling would book interview after interview.

400
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700
Something…

401
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700
something… taking away freedom…

402
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.700
something, something.

403
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.700
She doesn’t want the money.

404
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.700
She doesn’t need it.

405
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.730
She wants trans people groveling for her and
her supporters.

406
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:55.030
She wants to see trans influencers announce
their ‘breaks’ from twitter because her

407
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.980
cult of simps have made their online lives
a living hell.

408
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.760
For all Joanne has complained about death
threats, she never seemed to feel inclined

409
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.529
to take a break from her social media, yet
she has this delight of sending out follower

410
00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:12.400
hits on trans advocates and random internet
personalities.

411
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.630
I’m no psychologist, but this does not seem
like the mental profile of someone who will

412
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.789
rationally adjust their thinking because the
public spoke to her via the free market.

413
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:28.720
The problem with the boycott is that it was
framed by many as a direct message to Rowling.

414
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.120
This resulted in a large number of people
who either rationalized their pre-emptive

415
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.630
support for the game cynically — by reasoning
that it wouldn’t actually affect Rowling

416
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.390
so it wouldn’t matter.

417
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.190
Or people who felt that they could ‘offset’
their support for the game by donating to

418
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.460
a “trans charity.”

419
00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.519
This isn’t the carbon footprint of morality.

420
00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:49.940
You don’t get to net zero out by donating
money to relief against the thing you are

421
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.640
giving money to that hurts the people you’re
donating money to protect.

422
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.220
The result of this boycott should have been
to indicate a gesture of Trans solidarity.

423
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:04.440
Not just SUPPORT, not throwing $60 at trans
life line to make up for the $60 you spent

424
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.970
at GameStop— solidarity.

425
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:11.010
Because, let’s face it, the world doesn’t
happen on Twitter and most people still don’t

426
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.610
even really know that JK Rowling is a bigot,
because their frame of reference is what the

427
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.070
BBC says about her.

428
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:21.049
So pledging NOT to buy the game would have
been to a gesture to trans people to show

429
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:24.159
who they can or cannot trust.

430
00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:28.580
There are hundreds of video games that come
out every month — most of which are better

431
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.580
than this one.

432
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.760
You could demonstrate that respecting trans
identities is more important than playing

433
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760
a video game.

434
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.690
Instead, the drive for instant gratification
to give your support a cheat day left many

435
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:47.110
trans people feeling voiceless and questioning
their allies.

436
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:52.820
If ever there was an ‘ask’ from trans
people — for you to do something about how

437
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.300
YOU live, rather than how you treat others…

438
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.300
this was it.

439
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.799
And in reality — THIS is what a successful
boycott would have accomplished.

440
00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:04.100
It wouldn’t have bankrupted Rowling, it
wouldn't have killed the Harry Potter brand,

441
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.309
but it would have shown trans folks that the
people in their lives care more about them

442
00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:10.409
than a video game.

443
00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:14.769
And by all means, Hogwarts Legacy demonstrated
that this was the ‘last straw’ for more

444
00:32:14.769 --> 00:32:20.130
than a few fairweather friends who decided
that being an ally was too much work.

445
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.919
And quite frankly, it’s better to know who
they are now.

446
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:28.650
And that is where we should have expectations
for what a boycott — or any boycott — should

447
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.650
accomplish.

448
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.940
A judge of character, and often a very public
one.

449
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.490
But expecting this to do anything meaningful
about de-platforming a bigot was unrealistic.

450
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.850
So what do we do about HER, then?

451
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.340
We can do what we can to stop bigoted platforms
from growing, but what do we do about this

452
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.720
one particular lady?

453
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.810
There is an option left, but it takes a lot
more work than just tweeting about a video

454
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:56.000
game, accidentally helping it to trend on
Twitter.

455
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.200
A lot more work.

456
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.679
She needs to be made irrelevant.

457
00:32:58.679 --> 00:33:02.100
Now, she’ll always have clout as the creator
of Harry Potter.

458
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.700
There is no taking that away from her.

459
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.409
But why does Harry Potter have to be something
that can keep her relevant in a socio-political

460
00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:09.409
light Forever?

461
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:12.750
Why can’t it just be another book series
on the shelf?

462
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.710
Or another bunch of movies people watch once
and a while?

463
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.539
Of course the best way to do this would be
to lift up another author, preferably an out

464
00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:25.659
and proud queer author or at least a vocal
ally, who is writing foundational literature

465
00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:28.180
for children and young adults.

466
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.809
Foundational literature is a collection of
books and stories that we read, or are told

467
00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:32.809
as we grow up.

468
00:33:32.809 --> 00:33:36.649
(I already made a video about this, but as
Rowling’s been slipping deeper into alt-right

469
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:39.049
rhetoric, I’ve adjusted my take.)

470
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:43.370
These are the stories that help you develop
your sense of self, of right and wrong — these

471
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:48.740
bits of media are part of the experiences
which shape your fundamentally guiding values.

472
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.260
This is why Children’s literature is so
important, and why people fuss over Rhol Dahl

473
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.750
and Rojard Kipping.

474
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:59.590
For instance, the guy who coined the term:
“white man’s burden” is probably not

475
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.760
someone you should let into your kid’s head.

476
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.179
These creators are literally there to help
you instill morals into children's heads and

477
00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:08.179
futures.

478
00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:12.770
Typically, this type of literature is open
minded, and welcoming to people who aren’t

479
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.849
just like you.

480
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:18.260
Harry Potter seemed to have that aspect, since
mudbloods were heavily discriminated against,

481
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.980
and even murdered, by the fascists of Rowling’s
world.

482
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:26.360
But even though they were a minority among
wizards, good pure blood wizards still accepted

483
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360
them.

484
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.159
And so we as children read that as it being
important to accept people no matter their

485
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.260
background.

486
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.649
As long as they’re good people.

487
00:34:34.649 --> 00:34:38.610
We missed the stuff about Seamus and Cho Chang
and The Goblins and such because we were kids.

488
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.869
But unlike a lot of foundational literature,
which is usually focused on child readers,

489
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:48.629
the Harry Potter books ostensibly grew up
with us.

490
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:55.669
The characters aged and developed, the themes
became darker, and so… many of us never

491
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:59.099
grew out of the books during publication.

492
00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:00.790
They followed us into adulthood.

493
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.890
I personally had the perfect timing because
the final book was released less than a month

494
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.880
after I graduated from high school.

495
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.300
So I was the perfect age to grow up with the
books.

496
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.040
Which is why I clung onto Hogwarts for deal
life as a safe place for me for so long.

497
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.810
So that’s the kind of foundational literature
that we need to promote and get in the hands

498
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.099
of as many young readers as humanly possible.

499
00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:23.760
But it can’t be super disparate.

500
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.280
Every kid can’t have their own series because
then the societal connection doesn’t develop.

501
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.970
They all need to go to the same book.

502
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.970
Just like with Harry Potter.

503
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.730
You know it's interesting how my generation
grew up with Harry Potter and then came of

504
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:40.540
age with The Hunger Games and now we’re
a bunch of open minded, pretty accepting weirdos

505
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.540
who want to eat the rich.

506
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.720
Anyway, can we do that?

507
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.220
Can we force a single series of books to become
a global sensation like that?

508
00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.750
Is there one already out there with one or
two books, or has it yet to be written?

509
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.030
And don’t tell me Animorphs or Percy Jackson.

510
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.780
They’ve finished their run six times over
by now so there’s no waiting two or three

511
00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.630
years to find out what happens next.

512
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.190
This needs to be new.

513
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.340
Something everyone can gather around and wait
for midnight book launches.

514
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.140
It needs to be like an HBO show only for kids.

515
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:13.600
It doesn’t have to SELL like Harry Potter,
and it can even be something like a TV show,

516
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.960
if any network would let a show go past three
or four seasons these days.

517
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.270
The important part is that the youthful characters
need to grow up with their audience.

518
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.690
Stranger Things kind of fit the bill, to be
honest, but I think it starts off too dark

519
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.800
to get pre-teens on board.

520
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.599
Or at least for their parents to let them
watch it.

521
00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:31.540
But that just shows that it's possible.

522
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.569
Replace Harry Potter’s social importance
with something else.

523
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:40.640
But the other way to make her more or less
irrelevant to the wider discussion is something

524
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.630
we have no control over.

525
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.420
But profit-driven movie executives do.

526
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.480
In 1998 Warner Bros purchased the film rights
to the Harry Potter books, and today they

527
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.660
even share ownership of the “JK Rowling’s
Wizarding World” as a whole brand.

528
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.260
If you’ve been following entertainment industry
news the last few years, you’ll know Warner

529
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.940
Bros has been past around like a party bottoms
in Hollywood.

530
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.190
First Time Warner owned them, then AT&T owned
them, Now Discovery owns them, and according

531
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.960
to people in the know, Discovery plans on
selling Warner Bros to Universal Pictures

532
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.430
in 2024.

533
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.220
Which is why Warner Bros has been such a mess
lately.

534
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.020
They haven't had solid leadership for over
a decade.

535
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:23.480
So in 2024 when Universal buys Warner Bros,
they’re also buying their stake in The Wizarding

536
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480
World.

537
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.730
They’ve seen what’s happened to ticket
sales for Wizarding World movies since Joanne

538
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:34.270
went full TERF, so it's easy to see that her
connection with the franchise is an Albatross

539
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.500
around its neck.

540
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.690
So they could offer to buy the franchise from
her wholesale.

541
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:45.480
Now the evaluated worth of the Harry Potter
brand is about 26 billion dollars.

542
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.260
That includes potential income from the brand
in the future though, assuming Rowling’s

543
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.690
presence won’t hurt the brand.

544
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:55.400
Remember, Avalanche went out of their way
to say that she had nothing to do with Hogwarts

545
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.109
Legacy, which has been how many people defended
their purchase of the game.

546
00:37:59.109 --> 00:38:03.290
The last release she was directly attached
to the The Secrets of Dumbledore movie, which

547
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:10.030
bombed so badly it convinced Warner Bros to
kill the franchise right there, even though

548
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.060
they’d signed a deal for seven movies.

549
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.240
That’s just how much money they lost on
that thing.

550
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.860
I think Universal plans on buying out the
brand.

551
00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.970
They will be buying Warner’s stake in it,
so there’s already a discount.

552
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:26.020
Universal also stands to lose a lot of money
if Rowling goes too far off the deep end for

553
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.720
mainstream audiences to come up with excuses
anymore.

554
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.349
So buying her out would be a smart move.

555
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:36.180
And they wouldn’t even be paying full price
because a lot of the worth of the franchise

556
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:42.240
is tied up in publishing deals, toy deals,
apparel, Universal’s own Wizarding World

557
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240
park.

558
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:49.510
And as long as they continue the ongoing contracts,
they wouldn’t need to buy them out, so they’d

559
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.360
get it for much much less than 26 billion.

560
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360
Jesus.

561
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.020
26 billion is like… a theoretical number
for me and someone has it on their bank balance.

562
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.240
Eat the rich, kids.

563
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.700
There are two ways of take social power from
her.

564
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.040
We’ll never take her money away.

565
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.700
She’ll never be *not rich,* but we can make
it that her opinions don’t really matter

566
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.300
anymore.

567
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:16.160
If she’s just some rich person living in
a castle of all things, who the hell cares

568
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.250
what she thinks?

569
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:22.930
TERFS will, of course, and they’ll still
flock to her like some cult leader, but if

570
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:28.270
she no longer owns Harry Potter, or Harry
Potter is no longer relevant because another

571
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:33.880
formative piece of literature has superseded
it, then mainstream people will kind of forget

572
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880
that she exists.

573
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.740
They have short memories, those people who
live lives and do things other than live on

574
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740
Twitter.

575
00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.720
Now we can’t influence Universal buying
the franchise.

576
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.450
But we CAN do option #1.

577
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:50.160
We CAN push another piece of media to the
prominence required to overtake Harry Potter.

578
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.400
It can be a movie series, or a tv series,
but its best if its a book series.

579
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.589
They tend to have more longevity.

580
00:39:56.589 --> 00:40:00.690
And People connect more with books because
they can imagine the world in their own head

581
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.220
instead of just seeing what a director, cinematographer,
and set designer want them to see.

582
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.450
We can reduce her influence on the world.

583
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.740
Where once she spoke out loudly in favor of
social justice, she now works with people

584
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:19.320
fighting hard to condemn some of the most
endangered people among us.

585
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.960
People who might be risking their lives just
by leaving their house, she and her friends

586
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960
target them.

587
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:29.920
She has become the exact kind of villainous
bully we spent our childhoods reading her

588
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.420
heroes triumph over.

589
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.640
She was to be remembered as the woman who
made a generation of kids want to read.

590
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.210
Who told movie goers and readers around the
world that accepting people for being different

591
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.650
amounts to being a good person.

592
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.349
She created a world in which everyone felt
safe.

593
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:55.069
No matter your race, or skin color, or religious
belief, or your gender, or who you loved.

594
00:40:55.069 --> 00:41:00.330
She had created a legacy of not just tolerance,
but acceptance.

595
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:04.510
But now she’s tarnished it in the minds
of millions.

596
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:10.619
And as long as she controls it, Hogwarts won’t
feel safe for those people anymore.

597
00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:13.150
And she did that.

598
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:24.170
With her ignorance, intolerance, and belligerent
rhetoric, she’s made Hogwarts unsafe.

599
00:41:24.170 --> 00:44:00.019
And now that’s the real Hogwarts legacy.
