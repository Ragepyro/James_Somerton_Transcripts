00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
you

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.260
so far the Marvel Cinematic Universe has
been broken up into phases phase one was

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.770
the creation of the Avengers phase 2 has
been the aftermath and some further

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
world building and will culminate with
the Avengers 2 age of Ultron and phase 3

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
will likely end with the Avengers 3
infinity yes I'm calling it now the

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.380
third Avengers movie will be subtitled
infinity or at least have the word

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.010
infinity in the title somewhere anyway
we're all pretty sure or at least I

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.840
think I am about how phase 2 will turn
out Captain America the Winter Soldier

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.830
will introduce the concept of Ultron if
not the character which will probably be

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.670
a shield initiative since Joss Whedon
has stated that Hank Pym will not be the

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
creator of the psychotic Android so it's
either going to be a shield program gone

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.220
horribly wrong or creation of Tony's
gone wrong but I'm not sure that Weeden

13
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.120
is going to basically make Avengers 2
that centered on Tony Stark so I'm

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
sticking with the shield theory for now
anyway guardians of the galaxy will then

15
00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.650
play more toward the introduction of
Thanos that big purple guy from the

16
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.700
mid-credits scene in The Avengers it
will also look we find one or two more

17
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.109
of the infinity gems which are being
called Infinity stones in the Cinematic

18
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.420
Universe these stones play a huge part
in the Thanos storyline then we have age

19
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.810
of Ultron which aside from having a
psychotic killer robot as the main

20
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
villain is a lot cooler than he sounds
trust me we'll also include the

21
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
characters of Wanda and Pietro Maximoff
also known as the Scarlet Witch and

22
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.340
Quicksilver there's been a lot of drama
that these two being used by Marvel

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.479
because they're technically mutants and
the children of x-men villain magneto so

24
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
they should be within the x-men
franchise which is owned by fox but

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.619
that's a whole other can of worms and
I'm not going to try and explain that

26
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.240
here these two characters have the
potential to be very interesting

27
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.569
additions and I have a feeling that the
Scarlet Witch is going to play a massive

28
00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.810
part in the future of the Marvel
Cinematic Universe but more on that

29
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.640
later if Ultron ends up being a shield
initiative there will likely be some

30
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.749
disruption between shield and the
Avengers like a total split between the

31
00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.530
two groups the amount of destruction
that Ultron can cause will also leave

32
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.340
the Avengers in pretty rough state with
at least one of their founding members

33
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.110
being killed it is Joss Whedon after all
so they probably wouldn't be in the best

34
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.530
of shape once the house comes knocking
in Avengers 3 just two

35
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.700
months after the Avengers 2 comes out we
enter phase 3 with the introduction of

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.110
ant-man a character far more interesting
than his name may lead you to believe

37
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.830
but there hasn't been a whole lot of
other news about who else will pop up in

38
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.450
phase 3 well my first prediction is the
Doctor Strange will find his way onto

39
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.660
the silver screen likely with the
Scarlet Witch playing a supporting role

40
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.010
in the movie it will introduce magic to
the Marvel Cinematic Universe and allow

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.800
for some character development with the
Scarlet Witch away from her

42
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.450
overprotective brother phase three will
also likely see another Thor or Captain

43
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.440
America movie my guess would be Thor
since he sort of deals in the cosmic

44
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.769
side of things which is where Thanos
would be coming from phase 3 would also

45
00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.940
have a heavy focus on those Infinity
stones my guess is that the color is

46
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.019
traditionally used to represent the
infinity gems in the comics likely won't

47
00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.450
be used here but all six stones will
likely be included those six represent

48
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.160
soul time space mind reality and power
if you have all six you can pretty much

49
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.959
do anything you want which is why Thanos
wants them see he's literally in love

50
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.070
with the marvel universe version of the
Grim Reaper and basically wants to kill

51
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.350
the entire universe so the she'll love
him back he's got some issues but don't

52
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.040
we all so by the time Avengers 3 rolls
around we would have five of the six

53
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.540
stones accounted for except for the
reality stone Thanos comes to earth and

54
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.900
all hell breaks loose as he tries to
find that last stone and the Avengers

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.160
try to stop him obviously but where is
the stone that would be on earth but

56
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.700
where is it well I think it's
intrinsically linked with the Scarlet

57
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.019
Witch the reality stone gives you the
power to alter reality even if it

58
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.950
conflicts with the laws of science and
that basically explains the scarlet

59
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.750
witch's powers so thin ohs would end up
causing some serious physical and mental

60
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.970
damage to her in the process of getting
the stone is the stone inside her is she

61
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.989
simply a conduit for it who knows but I
see this type of thing happening of

62
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.190
course Thanos would be beaten with
probably even more Avengers being killed

63
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.690
off in the process my guess is that the
only original Avengers left alive at the

64
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.520
end of the third film will be Captain
America and Iron Man now phase 4 is some

65
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.820
tricky territory because we really have
no idea where Marvel could

66
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.780
Oh throughout phase four we would see
the Scarlet Witch trying to deal with

67
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.650
the trauma she went through during the
Thanos attack and mostly being ignored

68
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.240
by her fellow Avengers why they're very
busy fighting a public backlash the

69
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.140
public believing nathanael never have
come to earth had the Avengers not drawn

70
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.320
his attention Tony thinks that the
Avengers and shield should become

71
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.010
partners once again making them publicly
accountable and essentially turning the

72
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.030
Avengers into a government agency while
Captain America wholeheartedly disagrees

73
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.900
and believes that the Avengers need
their autonomy he's seen how corrupt the

74
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.410
government can be and he wants nothing
to do with it this major plot thread

75
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.440
would run throughout the phase four
movies a little bit at a time and this

76
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.710
would also be when the third Captain
America movie would take place which

77
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.130
would really highlight the schism
between the captain and Tony it would

78
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.210
also come to a head when the Avengers
team is literally split in half and at

79
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.380
war with each other Scarlet Witch
suffers a complete mental breakdown from

80
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.730
the combo of her already existing stress
and the new stress piled on by this war

81
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.710
between her friends the breakdown causes
her to inflict harm on both sides of the

82
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.000
Avenger civil war killing some and
eventually causing the team to unite

83
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.440
against her they would then voluntarily
disband under the reasoning that the

84
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.330
Avengers may have possibly caused more
harm than good now this is just my phase

85
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.350
4 theory it would draw heavily from
three existing Marvel storylines those

86
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.730
being civil war Avengers disassembled
with a hint of House of M mixed in there

87
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.270
although that could never really be
fully fleshed out because the Marvel

88
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.260
characters are split up between so many
different film studios but the spirit of

89
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.970
that story would be present in the end
the Scarlet Witch wouldn't die but would

90
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.010
fade away no one would know where she is
no one would be able to find her but she

91
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.050
would be alive somewhere so what about
phase 5 well faced by the so far off in

92
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.920
the future that I'd be flying blind to
make any kind of predictions for it but

93
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.220
if they follow through with the ideas
that I've outlined in this video I think

94
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.610
it would be great to introduce the young
avengers and culminate it with the

95
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.630
Children's Crusade storyline but who
knows this is probably all just wishful

96
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.930
thinking on my part so what do you guys
think of these predictions do you have

97
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.870
any marble storylines that you would
love to see come to life in the Marvel

98
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.500
Cinematic Universe and if you have any
suggestions for future videos let me

99
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.340
know in the comments below
