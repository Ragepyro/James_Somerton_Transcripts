00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.290
“Ms. Rowling of Edinburgh Scotland was proud
to say that she was a TERF, thank you very

2
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.670
much”.

3
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.060
*Sigh*

4
00:00:32.060 --> 00:01:03.990
PART ONE: The Philosopher’s Denial

5
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:18.619
So here we are.

6
00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.990
Honestly didn’t think I’d end up making
this video.

7
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.909
In fact I said in a few livestreams that I
wouldn’t.

8
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.990
But it’s just been nagging and nagging at
me.

9
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.450
I’d made my video about queer themes in
Harry Potter back in 2018, the halcyon days

10
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.140
of when you could give Joanne Rowling the
benefit of the doubt.

11
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.729
And boy did I ever give her the benefit of
the doubt.

12
00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
And why wouldn’t I?

13
00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.329
She was a powerful female author who used
her voice to raise money for charity and vocally

14
00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.850
support marginalized communities.

15
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.119
Crimes of Grinldewald hadn’t even come out
yet, so I was flying high on the potential

16
00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.819
for gay representation in the magical world.

17
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.979
Then the movie came out.

18
00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.889
Then she started retweeting things.

19
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.039
Then she wrote the essay.

20
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.039
Then she wrote the book.

21
00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.229
And on and on.

22
00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.180
I don’t think I need to go into all the
gory details of Rowling’s descent into TERFism.

23
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.849
Contrapoints made a fantastic video doing
that, so just go watch that if you want an

24
00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.400
actual trans person’s opinion.

25
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.430
I’m just a cis guy holding a grudge.

26
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.670
The TLDR version is that Rowling has spent
the last several years positioning herself

27
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.210
as TERF, (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist)
numero uno on the internet.

28
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.220
She’s been very good at doing that thing
we all associate with racists.

29
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.520
You know.

30
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.980
“I’m very good friends with trans people,
but…”

31
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.560
“I’m not transphobic, but…”

32
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.510
Now before some of ya’ll jump down my throat,
no I’m not calling her racist.

33
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.750
The way she codes certain characters of colour
in her books is… questionable, but she hasn’t

34
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.800
done anything out and out racist, as far as
I know.

35
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.330
Though her appropriation of native American
beliefs for Fantastic Beasts was… contentious.

36
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.600
No, she’s instead, been laser focused on
trans people.

37
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.980
It’s much safer to be transphobic than racist
these days anyway.

38
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.450
People might give you dirty looks, or even
stop talking to you if you’re too racist

39
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.450
too publicly.

40
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.330
At least in semi-civilized circles.

41
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.570
Same for homophobia, really.

42
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.170
Imagine if Rowling went full homophobe.

43
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.620
She’d have no choice but to write under
a psyudenum next time!

44
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.100
But not so when it comes to trans people.

45
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.350
Even a lot of people who support trans rights
aren’t willing to risk their social cache

46
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.870
on defending them, especially to someone like
Rowling.

47
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.200
Some celebrities, such as the younger cast
of the Harry Potter movies did come out and

48
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.730
declare “trans women are women”, which
is good.

49
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.970
Though the older actors all seem to be in
lockstep with Rowling’s more… conservative

50
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.740
point of view.

51
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.500
Some of the actors of the Fantastic Beasts
movies even came out against her transphobia.

52
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500
But.

53
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.510
It’s not like they left the movies.

54
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.190
And before you say they couldn’t because
of contractual obligations… contracts between

55
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.540
actors and studios have Morality clauses.

56
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.870
That’s why Johnny Depp isn’t in Fantastic
Beasts anymore.

57
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.120
Studios can nullify contracts if an actor
does something morally reprehensible (Murder,

58
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.870
sexual assault, spousal abuse, etc), and actors
can nullify the contract if they believe producers

59
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.680
of a film are committing acts that go against
their own morals.

60
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.560
And since JK Rowling IS a producer on the
Fantastic Beasts movies, this leaves the actors

61
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.590
wide open to drop the franchise like the steaming
pile of mediocrity it is.

62
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.690
But they haven’t so to hell with them.

63
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.100
If box office numbers are any indication,
the franchise isn’t long for this world

64
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.100
anyway.

65
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.360
And don’t start with the “Crimes of Grindlewald
made 654 million dollars world wide, its a

66
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360
success”.

67
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360
No.

68
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.780
That movie had a 200 million dollar production
budget, plus over a hundred million in advertising

69
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.780
spend.

70
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.270
That’s three hundred million dollars spent.

71
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.790
The studio only gets , roughly, 50% of the
box office gross because theaters keep the

72
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:09.640
other 50% (Chinese theaters keep around 70%),
so Warner Bros made a profit of roughly 26

73
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.230
million dollars off that movie, if you’re
being generous.

74
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.130
A precipitous drop from the highs of the Harry
Potter franchise.

75
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.370
And since the next movie is going to be releasing
into a world where people may or may not be

76
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.540
comfortable going back to theatres, I can
only imagine it will be making even less.

77
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.180
How did this become a seminar on the minutea
of the film industry?

78
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.260
Back to Rowling.

79
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.180
I can’t wrap my head around how all of this
happened.

80
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.190
Honestly.

81
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.960
How this woman who wrote books that’s defined
my adolescence, and the adolescences of queer

82
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.510
people around the world, became so toxic?

83
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.840
How did she, so quickly, go from being the
author held up by millions as an example of

84
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.700
wokeness… to this?

85
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.270
It’s a long story.

86
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.770
See I discovered the books in 2001, just before
the first movie came out, and only about a

87
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.060
year after I myself came out.

88
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.370
Other than getting a rock off the back of
the head and some minor brain damage, nobody

89
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.820
really had a problem with my being gay.

90
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.540
But my god I was lonely.

91
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.650
Not only was I gay in a small town but I was
fat and gay in a small town.

92
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.900
I knew that even if I did manage to find other
gay people they probably wouldn’t want anything

93
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.070
to do with me.

94
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.140
So I escaped that shitty world for the magical
one she created.

95
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.200
Out of order, mind you.

96
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.940
I started with Prisoner of Azkaban, then Chamber
of Secrets, then Philosopher’s Stone, then

97
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.389
Goblet of Fire.

98
00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.860
After that I read the books as they were released.

99
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.440
I was one of the kids who made his parents
drive him to a book store at midnight so he

100
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.880
could buy the newest entry in the adventures
of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.

101
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.570
I’m the one who started studying mythology
because of the off-hand references that Rowling

102
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.300
sprinkled throughout the books.

103
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.890
I was at every preview screening of the movies,
which was pretty hard to pull off living 40

104
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.390
minutes away from the nearest movie theatre.

105
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.550
But I was there.

106
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.320
Sometimes I was there all alone because my
parents were busy and my friends weren’t

107
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.850
into Harry Potter.

108
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.350
Growing up in a small town, I had next to
no exposure to anyone who wasn’t white,

109
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.350
straight, and catholic.

110
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.850
I never even met a black person until I was
sixteen.

111
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.650
So I could have come dangerously close to
becoming a close-minded bigot.

112
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.090
I certainly wouldn’t have been the only
one in the area.

113
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.520
But that didn’t happen.

114
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.980
Instead I was open to new ideas, new people
of different races and backgrounds.

115
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.150
People who saw the world differently than
me.

116
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.820
Who had different lived experiences than me.

117
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.669
Because I got to escape to Hogwarts.

118
00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.500
Where being different didn’t mean you were
bad.

119
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.650
Where being weird meant you were special,
not deviant.

120
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.220
Where students of different races and nationalities
came together to bring down a villain hellbent

121
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.550
on destroying pluralism.

122
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.150
Who wanted the world to be exactly as he saw
it, and would kill anyone who stepped out

123
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.259
of line.

124
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:03.330
So because of seven books and eight movies,
I had my mind forced open to the fact that

125
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.880
people who are different from me are not less
than me.

126
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.699
Something I appreciated when I got to film
school and was surrounded by the types of

127
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.540
people I’d only ever seen on tv and in movie
up until then.

128
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.680
And I thanked Rowling for that.

129
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.680
She helped this lonely gay kid feel not so
alone, that there was a group of people out

130
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.300
there, somewhere, who would accept me.

131
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.160
Who would welcome me in and make me feel like
a part of something bigger than just my small

132
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.030
town.

133
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.399
And I thanked her for that by spending as
much money on Harry Potter merchandise as

134
00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.399
I could.

135
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.630
I loved it all.

136
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.810
Different house scarves.

137
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.810
Lego.

138
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.779
Collectors edition sets of the books and movies.

139
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:41.779
Over-priced wands.

140
00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.520
I was even saving up to pay an exorbitant
amount of money for tickets to see the Cursed

141
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.020
Child play before I read it and realized it
was horrible.

142
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.720
But it wasn’t written by Rowling, so that
explained everything!

143
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.550
As far as I was concerned everything she touched
was gold.

144
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.870
And then… things started to rust.

145
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.920
PART TWO: The Chamber of Anger

146
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.020
First came The Crimes of Grindlewald.

147
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.810
I don’t think I’ve ever given a movie
so much leeway.

148
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.920
Leading up to the release I, and many other
people, were incredibly excited to finally

149
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.911
get on screen confirmation of the relationship
between Dumbledore and Grindlewald, something

150
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:28.240
Rowling had confirmed after the release of
the final Harry Potter book.

151
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.820
And then the director said we wouldn’t be
getting it in this movie and then the movie

152
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.940
came out and… well, we didn’t get it.

153
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.680
But that was ok, I said.

154
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.790
We’d get it eventually.

155
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.970
And I fought with so many people on the internet
saying that “no no no, of course they weren’t

156
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.180
going to have Dumbledore and Grindlewald making
out in this movie.

157
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.790
They’d save that until the finale!

158
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.960
Movie 5.

159
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.380
Because that way you’d be less likely to
lose the family audience throughout the series.”

160
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.190
Nevermind that the script for Crimes of Grindlewald
was a disaster that absolutely reeked of first

161
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.190
draft sickness.

162
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.960
But I defended the movie and Rowling online
to no end.

163
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.420
I spent hours figuring out how they could
confirm the relationship between Grindlewald

164
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.480
and Dumbledore in some physical way that could
retain the PG-13 rating, and be easily removable

165
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.620
for markets like China and Russia.

166
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.120
I was invested in convincing other people
that they were wrong to criticize her.

167
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.110
That she was playing the game as best she
could.

168
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.120
After it was a box office disappointment,
I made the argument that it should go to a

169
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.060
streaming service, like Netflix or the eventually
announced HBO MAX.

170
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:42.980
Since HBO MAX doesn’t exist in, well, anywhere
outside the US, let alone in China and Russia,

171
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.399
you wouldn’t have to worry about the movie
being banned in countries with homophobic

172
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.600
governments.

173
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.910
And you wouldn’t have to worry about parents
groups losing their shit about gay wizards

174
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.600
because the HBO MAX subscription model had
already locked them in for a year or more.

175
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.660
And by the time it came up for renewal, they’d
have forgotten about it and stayed subscribed

176
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.790
for a DC show or a Game of Thrones show or
something.

177
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:11.240
But as I was busy defending her, and trying
to figure out ways Warner Media could make

178
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.420
money, she’d been busy doing other things.

179
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.990
Unfortunately, it wasn’t taking screenwriting
classes.

180
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.089
JK Rowling had been busy on Twitter.

181
00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:25.279
Starting out simply by retweeting some transphobic
tweets that her PR representatives deemed

182
00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:27.100
a “clumsy and middle-aged moment”.

183
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.430
I bought the spin of course, because how on
earth could the woman who helped ensure I

184
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.910
didn’t grow up to be a bigot be, well, a
bigot?

185
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.050
Obviously it was a mistake.

186
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.250
She hadn’t seen these people’s other,
way more transphobic tweets.

187
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.430
This happened right around the time that Lego
started releasing Harry Potter sets, including

188
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.550
a piece by piece recreation of Hogwarts.

189
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.020
So, of course, I bought each set immediately
upon release.

190
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.990
All the while defending her to gay friends
but, keeping quiet about her to my trans friends.

191
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:10.750
Underneath my adoration for her I was starting
to feel… embarrassed.

192
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.770
But it was easy enough to just keep buying
the merchandise, because the lego was being

193
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.390
released during a time when Rowling had mostly
disappeared from social media.

194
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.589
Taking a self imposed break after the backlash
that followed the initial retweets of transphobes.

195
00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:28.720
Only popping up once and a while with cryptic
posts about upcoming projects, or confirming

196
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.420
fan theories about Harry Potter that she never
bothered to write into the books.

197
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.850
And then came the tweets.

198
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.529
They started relatively benign enough, with
Rowling being frustrated over the term “People

199
00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.769
who menstruate”.

200
00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:48.740
A term that’s trying to be inclusive of
certain trans men but just sounds… off.

201
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:55.180
In the right light it does sound a tad bit
dehumanizing, so I could see why people would

202
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.110
be put off by it.

203
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.900
Then she started retweeting loud and proud
TERFS like Maya Forstater and the shit completely

204
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.610
hit the fan.

205
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.840
When some of her followers criticized the
tweet as being off-color or even possibly

206
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.930
transphobic Rowling responded by saying:

207
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.460
“Dress however you please.

208
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.270
Call yourself whatever you like.

209
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.790
Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have
you.

210
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.510
Live your best life in peace and security.

211
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:27.050
But force women out of their jobs for stating
that sex is real?”

212
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:28.050
Later saying:

213
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.890
“If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex
attraction.

214
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:37.610
If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of
women globally is erased.

215
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.610
I know and love trans people, but erasing
the concept of sex removes the ability of

216
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.000
many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

217
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.040
It isn’t hate to speak the truth.”

218
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.920
And out came the “If sex isn’t real”
argument.

219
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.010
This is something that TERFs love to do.

220
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.300
Equate sex and gender.

221
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.410
Either because their ignorant of the difference,
too dumb to tell, or just assholes.

222
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.810
Essentially, sex is biological in nature.

223
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.130
It’s determined on a chromosomal level.

224
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.630
Masculine and feminine sexual characteristics
are, for the most part determined by this.

225
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:19.320
I say for the most part because intersex people
also exist, despite what TERFs will admit,

226
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.310
and really ought to be included in the conversation.

227
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:29.100
Not everyone in the whole wide world fits
into the neat little binary of XX or XY chromosomes.

228
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.640
So sex is biological.

229
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.760
Immutable.

230
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.810
Whereas gender is a social construct.

231
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.029
Man and woman.

232
00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:39.680
Something that a lot of people think is innate
in nature.

233
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.990
Even though for thousands of years there have
been third genders recognized all over the

234
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.990
world.

235
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.160
Non-binary genders.

236
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.350
In many places people who didn’t fit neatly
into the male or female category were considered

237
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.940
closer to god because of it.

238
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.370
But TERFs have a hard enough time wrapping
their head around the idea of someone born

239
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.780
into a feminine body transitioning, binarily,
into a masculine one.

240
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.820
Or vice versa.

241
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.370
Can you imagine their heads exploding at the
concept of not having to be male or female?

242
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.370
Wingardium Levi-o-shit!

243
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.611
On top of that, she used the argument that
“If sex isn’t real, there’s no same

244
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:14.670
sex attraction”.

245
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.100
The loudest dog whistle in the world to try
and pit cisgender gays and lesbians against

246
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.920
trans people.

247
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.180
Almost threatening us that “If you let transgender
be a thing, that completely delegitimizes

248
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.770
everything you’ve fought for”.

249
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.770
It doesn’t.

250
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:34.050
She was just trying to win over some allies.

251
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:38.029
And then she doubled down, and tripled down,
and quadrupled down until finally publishing

252
00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:41.820
a thousand page detective novel with a serial
killer who dresses up like a woman in order

253
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.110
to ubduct and murder them.

254
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:50.389
I mean I know she’s well known for pulling
themes and creatures from mythology for Harry

255
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:55.899
Potter, but did she have to pull out a lazy
thriller trope that’s even older than she

256
00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:57.040
is?

257
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.350
That was played out before the first Harry
Potter book was published.

258
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.270
Silence of the Lambs did this and is one of
the best movies ever made.

259
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.230
You’re not going to do better.

260
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.750
And you know you’re not going to do it better.

261
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.190
So why try?

262
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.920
Could it be that you’re delusional enough
to think that you can write a thriller that’s

263
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.980
better than Silence of the Lambs?

264
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.339
Or, maybe, are you doing it because you have
an agenda?

265
00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.930
It’s the second one, btw.

266
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.930
In case I’m being too subtle.

267
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.389
PART THREE: The Prisoner of Gender

268
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:32.290
But how did this happen?

269
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.260
How did the woman who told an entire generation
of kids that being their true selves is good,

270
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.170
and the right thing… end up doing a 180
and completely disavowing a whole group of

271
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.970
people just trying to live their lives?

272
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:53.700
I mean it came as a hell of a shock to me
but it wasn’t all that shocking to people

273
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.760
who know what’s going on in current mainstream
British feminism.

274
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.360
An anti-trans strain of feminism has always
simmered under the surface, but it’s really

275
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.020
come to light over the last few years in England,
especially after the proposed changes to the

276
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.220
nation’s Gender Recognition Act.

277
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.600
The Gender Recognition Act, a law put on the
books in 2004, sets up the legal process for

278
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.240
trans people to change their legal gender
on their birth certificates.

279
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.799
Because at the time that decision was not
made by you, or your doctor, but by an anonymous

280
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.640
group of beurocrats.

281
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.840
In 2017, the government announced a possible
reform that would let trans people make a

282
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.210
legal declaration that they pledged to live
the rest of their lives as their transitioned

283
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.220
gender.

284
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.270
But there was a hell of a lot of backlash
from TERFs, people who generally hate trans

285
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:45.770
people, and the very transphobic English press
who had a habit of running stories with dead

286
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.770
names.

287
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.970
These reporters falsely claimed that allowing
trans people to “self-ID” meant that a

288
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.890
person could declare themselves a man on Monday
and a woman on Friday, allowing rapists to

289
00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.320
gain access to women’s only spaces like
bathrooms and changing rooms.

290
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.990
Now, I’ve never been sexually assaulted,
but I do know a disturbing amount of women

291
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.990
who have.

292
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:13.330
I’ve been the one taking them to the hospital,
the cops, or the counciling sessions.

293
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:19.980
And something I’ve discovered through all
of this is… rapists don’t go through that

294
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.809
much effort.

295
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.299
They just do it.

296
00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:26.050
It’s a power thing.

297
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.120
Men who believe they’re more powerful than
women are not going to dress up as a woman

298
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.820
in order to assault her.

299
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.730
They’re too lazy for that, don’t give
them that much credit.

300
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.130
But I digress.

301
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:43.720
The campaign of lies in the press soon moved
on to spread more lies, now about trans children.

302
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.780
That kids were being forced to transition
by ultra-woke parents and experimental doctors.

303
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.919
As a result, a large proportion of mainstream
British feminists started loudly proclaiming

304
00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:58.010
that it’s not possible to change biological
sex.

305
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.580
Always ALWAYS focusing on biology and not
sociology.

306
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.940
No one, to my knowledge, has claimed that
a trans person can change their chromosomal

307
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.940
sex.

308
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.880
Only in a perfect world.

309
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.450
BUT, one can change their gender, because
that is simply how you are perceived by society.

310
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.770
Lavern Cox may have an X and a Y chromosome,
but if you’re lucky enough to see her walking

311
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.430
down the street, you’re not thinking anything
but woman.

312
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:29.049
Meanwhile, in most mainstream North American
feminist circles, speaking out against trans

313
00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:33.310
women and men is not considered feminism at
all.

314
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.840
It’s considered being a dick head.

315
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.440
But trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF)
ideology has been helped along in the UK by

316
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.280
false media campaigns lead by the likes of
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian billionaire

317
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.299
who birthed Fox News.

318
00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:52.309
Any opposition to gender-critical or TERF
thought in the UK brings accusations of “silencing

319
00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:56.350
women”, leading to Australian TERF Sheila
Jeffreys going before the UK Parliament in

320
00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.890
March of 2018 to declare that trans women
“parasites,”.

321
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.160
Charming.

322
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:10.630
vox.com reported that According to , who studies
the modern gender-critical movement, gender-critical

323
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:16.440
feminism in the UK grew out of a toxic mix
of historical imperialism, and any concept

324
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.580
that looks at gender as anything but biologically
determined.

325
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.280
Those who rose to prominence in the movement
did so through “Call out culture”, attacking

326
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.610
trans men and women online.

327
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:33.720
Declaring trans women to be male perverts,
and trans men to be lost lesbian sisters.

328
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.240
Nevermind that trans men can also be gay or
bisexual.

329
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.710
Another fact TERFS don’t like acknowledging.

330
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.200
“Anti-trans feminists think they have science
on their side,” Greensmith said.

331
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:53.240
“It is bananas how ascientific their rhetoric
is, and yet literally they say, ‘Biology

332
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.580
isn’t bigotry.’

333
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.630
In fact, biology has been used as bigotry
as long as biology has been a thing.”

334
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.700
Biology has been used to hold people down
for thousands of years.

335
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.460
Holding down women, people of color - You
name a non-white-male group and biology has

336
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.169
been used to bring the boot down on them at
some point.

337
00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:14.270
And the biology narrative has only grown in
the UK.

338
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.640
TERFism has become so prevalent there that
many liberal pundits even blamed the conservative

339
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.290
Tory victory in the last parliamentary election
on trans people, saying that trans issues

340
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.960
are just a hyper-woke product of a political
left that has simply gone too far.

341
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.210
BREXIT was even blamed on trans people.

342
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.200
Donald Trump’s election win in 2016 was
blamed on trans people!

343
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.480
By British people!

344
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.289
So English feminists, of which JK Rowling
considers herself a proud member, were already

345
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:45.539
at a tipping point when Maya Forstater sued
the Centre for Global Development, a non-profit

346
00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:50.340
think tank that decided not to renew her expiring
contract when they discovered that she’d

347
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.280
been spreading TERFY shit all over the internet.

348
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.440
After a hearing with a UK employment tribunal,
Judge James Tayler (good name) ruled that

349
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.870
Forstater’s gender-critical views did not
represent a legally protected philosophical

350
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.870
belief.

351
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:04.870
He said:

352
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:10.140
“I consider that the Claimant’s view,
in its absolutist nature, is incompatible

353
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.790
with human dignity and [the] fundamental rights
of others.”

354
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.940
That’s when the “Dress however you please”
tweet came out, and it’s just been downhill

355
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.250
ever since.

356
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.500
Including publishing an overly long essay
basically explaining why she thinks trans

357
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.060
people aren’t valid.

358
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:34.230
Mostly has to do with bathrooms, because of
course it does.

359
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.679
One person replied to her tweets, writing:
“As a physician, I want people to know that

360
00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:45.790
sex exists on a bimodal biological spectrum
just like gender exists on a bimodal sociological

361
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.039
spectrum.

362
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:52.760
While most identify as either female or male,
there are intersex and trans individuals whose

363
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.770
identities are just as valid and real.”

364
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.080
Rowling proceeded to block them.

365
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.200
And ever since then she has been more than
happy to spout off about her ignorant beliefs

366
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.010
whenever given the chance.

367
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.940
Like in her 3600 word blog, “TERF Wars”.

368
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.660
Oh she’s so funny.

369
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.230
“TERF Wars” aha ha ha ha

370
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:18.030
PART FOUR: The Goblet of Bargaining

371
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.920
In the blog, Rowling writes about her struggles
with sexism and misogyny, adding that reading

372
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.559
accounts of gender dysphoria in trans men
had made her wonder “if I’d been born

373
00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:31.640
30 years later, I too might have tried to
transition”.

374
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.620
Also writing: “Many, myself included, believe
we are watching a new kind of conversion therapy

375
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.500
for young gay people, who are being set on
a lifelong path of medicalization.”

376
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.809
Some readers took this as her actually comparing
gender confirming therapies to gay conversion

377
00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:52.190
therapy, which has been labeled torture by
many psychological professionals.

378
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.720
You didn’t have to stretch very far to see
the comparison.

379
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.580
Her response to this was:

380
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.380
“I’ve ignored fake tweets attributed to
me and RTed widely.

381
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.420
I’ve ignored porn tweeted at children on
a thread about their art.

382
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.510
I’ve ignored death and rape threats.

383
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.100
I’m not going to ignore this.”

384
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.200
Well at least she’s got her priorities straight.

385
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.700
Then she signed an open letter condemning
cancel culture.

386
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.679
The billionaire author who lives in a castle
and was about to have another book hit #1

387
00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:26.200
on the New York Times Best Seller list…
complaining about being cancelled.

388
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.270
Warner Bros official statement regarding her
repeated infractions was:

389
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:36.750
Couldn’t use the word transgender once,
huh?

390
00:24:36.750 --> 00:25:19.720
I mean they might have well said, “we believe
in people” for how much sense and genuine

391
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.740
emotion this statement had.

392
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:28.680
But, Warner Bros hasn’t been known for making
a lot of sense lately.

393
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.770
There has been some backlash, mostly from
queer inclusive groups.

394
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.350
But the most interesting response has actually
been from the fans.

395
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:41.830
To a very large extent, fans of Harry Potter
have been beside themselves… ourselves,,,

396
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.360
with her actions.

397
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.070
While some just wish she’d stop, and go
back to the Rowling we thought we knew and

398
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.240
loved… many are not afraid of letting her
know how they feel on social media.

399
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.440
And it’s gotten under her skin too.

400
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.659
She threatened to sue some people for calling
her a bigot on Twitter, and apparently hasn’t

401
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:03.590
spoken to Emma Watson since the actress posted
this photo of herself on Instagram with a

402
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.179
shirt declaring “Trans rights are human
rights”.

403
00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:13.450
The thing is though, Rowling is pretty insulated
from most negativity toward her.

404
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.030
She’s surrounded herself with fellow TERFs
who agree with her.

405
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.129
She’s fabulously wealthy.

406
00:26:19.129 --> 00:26:25.299
If she didn’t make one more single solitary
penny for the rest of her life, her family

407
00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:27.429
could live in luxury for centuries.

408
00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:29.710
I mean she lives in a literal castle.

409
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.720
So she couldn’t care less if people are
angry with her about her opinion on trans

410
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720
people.

411
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720
She’s got money.

412
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.990
She’s got influence.

413
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.059
Her books are still #1 bestsellers, even when
her name isn’t on them.

414
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:45.860
Funnily enough, book wise, she’s been careful
with her name.

415
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.510
The book about the cross dressing serial killer
was published under her non-de-plum, Robert

416
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:56.080
Galbraith, creating a little layer of insulation
for her, at least among the uninformed.

417
00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.710
Her name, these days, only gets branded onto
things that have to do with Wizards, but even

418
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.179
that isn’t set in stone.

419
00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:09.230
When the first Fantastic Beasts movie came
out the branding behind it was “JK Rowling’s

420
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.140
Wizarding World”.

421
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:16.000
But by the time the sequel hit theatres it
was just “Wizarding World”.

422
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.390
And that’s how it’s stayed ever since.

423
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.990
Back in 2018 she’d already started in with
the so called “Middle aged moments” by

424
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.710
retweeting people calling trans women “men
in dresses”.

425
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:29.490
So I wouldn’t be surprised if Warner Bros,
who own a massive stake in the Harry Potter

426
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.070
brand, had a hand in removing her name from
the series branding.

427
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.529
Not because they’re so trans friendly, but
because they didn’t want to risk it becoming

428
00:27:37.529 --> 00:27:39.110
a public relations issue.

429
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.090
And for the most part, it worked.

430
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.200
People, even those in the queer community,
still love Harry Potter.

431
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.340
Despite Rowling.

432
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.400
People have been able to separate the author
from the creation so that they can continue

433
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.220
to enjoy the world she created without supporting
her personally.

434
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.270
This was my take on things as late as last
summer.

435
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.080
To some extent I guess it still is.

436
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.350
If I had completely disowned her creations
I probably wouldn’t have a thousand dollars

437
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.799
worth of Hogwarts lego.

438
00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:12.090
But the TERF wars article kind of broke me.

439
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:17.350
I couldn’t pretend that supporting her creations
wasn’t supporting her anymore.

440
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.880
I started coming at this a bit differently
than a lot of people, especially my fellow

441
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.010
cis people.

442
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.299
I’ve found that trans folks are far more
willing to drop her and everything she’s

443
00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:28.909
created, which makes a lot of sense.

444
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:33.830
She’s been using her vast influence to hurt
the trans community for years now.

445
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:39.090
But I also have some trans friends who have
actually gotten tattoos of the deathly hallows

446
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.220
or harry’s glasses just to spite her.

447
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.990
Because they love the wizarding world.

448
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.289
It helped them feel accepted at a time when
they couldn’t even accept themselves and

449
00:28:49.289 --> 00:28:52.220
they’ll be damned if they’re going to
let her take that away from them.

450
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.720
It’s a really weird situation all around.

451
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.270
The way I’ve come to looking at it is…

452
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.890
I can’t spend another dime on branded Harry
Potter merchandise.

453
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.200
Even though there’s some lego sets I desperately
want.

454
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.299
But plenty of people, even trans people, disagree
with me on that.

455
00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:17.260
You see, things like lego and action figures
and scarves and puzzles and video games…

456
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:23.030
companies signed licenses for those things
long before she went full TERF, at least publicly.

457
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:27.179
They could use the morality clause in their
contracts to sever ties with her, but they’ve

458
00:29:27.179 --> 00:29:31.470
spent so much money on the products already
that the projected loss of revenue would have

459
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.260
their stockholders abandoning ship.

460
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.179
One could argue that buying the merchandise
though just reinforces companies willingness

461
00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:41.440
to work with transphobes.

462
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:47.799
That they can work with TERFs and bigots because,
when it comes to the trans community, it won’t

463
00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:49.279
mean any lost sales.

464
00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:54.200
But from another point of view, NOT buying
Harry Potter stuff because she’s apparently

465
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.190
a rabid bigot is really only hurting the companies
producing the products.

466
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.860
Because she already got paid when the contract
was signed.

467
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.020
She doesn’t get royalties from sales, she
gets an upfront licensing fee.

468
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.799
Take for instance the upcoming Hogwarts Legacy
video game from Avalanche Studios.

469
00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:16.830
They’re a great little studio that have
made a lot of fun games over the years.

470
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.059
Their bread and butter was actually doing
video games for Disney, like the super fun

471
00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:27.190
Disney Infinity series, but they almost had
to close when Disney shuttered Disney Interactive.

472
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:32.150
The companies and its employees were pretty
much left out to dry until they lucked out

473
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:37.270
and got the chance to work on Hogwarts Legacy
in 2017, saving the company from bankruptcy.

474
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.559
A year before JK Rowling made the first “men
in dresses” retweet.

475
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:47.940
And Avalanche, to their credit, has made it
VERY clear that Rowling has absolutely NO

476
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.789
involvement with the game’s development.

477
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:54.410
So, if you’re interested in the game, and
you want to play it when it eventually gets

478
00:30:54.410 --> 00:31:00.220
released, is it fair to boycott it because
of the rotten things Rowling has said?

479
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.029
I don’t have the answer to that, but it’s
a question worth asking.

480
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:08.320
Because there is a very valid argument that
says the by buying Harry Potter merchandise,

481
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.059
you’re not necessarily making her richer,
since she’s already been paid for it, but

482
00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:15.520
that you’re continuing to make her relevant.

483
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.899
And her being relevant to the cultural conversation
gives her power and influence.

484
00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:25.320
A lot more power and influence than her just
being rich.

485
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.789
A lot of people make the argument that buying
Wizarding World merch is putting more money

486
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:31.100
in her pocket.

487
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.399
A fair argument but…

488
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:36.909
She’s already so rich that taking a few
sales away from her will have a net zero effect

489
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:37.909
on her life.

490
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:43.510
But if you love Harry Potter, if it means
something to you, removing it from your life

491
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.659
entirely might actually have an effect on
you.

492
00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:51.870
Because for many of us, Harry Potter represents
something more than just a book we read as

493
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.040
kids or teens.

494
00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:00.310
It became a part of our identity because it
exists in a very rarified place of cultural

495
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.370
importance.

496
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.370
Formative literature.

497
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.130
PART FIVE: The Order of Foundations

498
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.440
Formative Bigotry

499
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.890
You may have noticed that this is a bit of
a sore spot for me, and that given that I’m

500
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:20.070
a self-identified Harry Potter fan or a…
recovering Harry Potter fan.

501
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.070
Or a…

502
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.149
Harry Potter fan in remission?

503
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.149
[Shrugs]

504
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:27.540
Anyway, this isn’t me blasting Rowling because
I’m trying to hide the fact that I love

505
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.799
the franchise in order to make it seem like
I’m publicly distancing myself from her

506
00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:33.180
and it.

507
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:39.850
The point is that I’m getting so flustered
over this not because I’m putting on airs,

508
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.000
but because I've kind of taken it personally.

509
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
how all of this has gone.

510
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Or rather, I feel kind of personally attacked.

511
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
By Rowling.

512
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Like she went out of her way to whip me into
a defensive frenzy to absolve her of any perceived

513
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
wrongdoing.

514
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Specifically me.

515
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
But then I have to ask myself.

516
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Why is it that I, at the time, and others
who — to this day — continue to defend

517
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Rowling against all criticism?

518
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.360
I mean I jumped ship when she said the quiet
part loudly enough, even then I might have

519
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.700
held out for longer than I should have.

520
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.000
But why do people still defend her when she’s
shown her true colours?

521
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.179
And not even the turfy-kinda veneration of
her gender critical beliefs, or people who

522
00:33:07.179 --> 00:33:11.279
dismiss the issue altogether, but why do so
many people still continue to argue that she

523
00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:14.279
isn’t, in fact, transphobic?

524
00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:18.679
Why go through the mental gymnastics of explaining
how her poorly-edited, gender-critical tirades

525
00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:24.789
are in fact not only reasonable, but in fact
trans-inclusive?

526
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:27.169
She gives them a reason to, though.

527
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:31.370
To this day JK Rowling continues to insist
that she loves and respects trans people.

528
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:38.960
But i think she feels that trans gender identity
is this kind of variant of an assigned birth

529
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960
gender?

530
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.110
Kinda like a trans-woman exists as a variant
of man, and vice versa.

531
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.540
And she’s made it clear she’s willing
to love and support that.

532
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.190
As long as trans women continue to identify
as men, she’s on board for that.

533
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.190
I can see her as one of those white women
who insist that drag is cultural appropriation

534
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.190
of women.

535
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.309
The thing is, love and support is Rowling’s
brand.

536
00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:58.940
That’s kind of the identifiable niche she
carved out for herself, not only by making

537
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.020
Hogwards visually diverse — if a little
stereotypical to the point of ignorance — but

538
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.360
the brazen theme of the books is diversity.

539
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.090
And she kept that rolling through her correspondence
with both the press and her audience.

540
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:19.971
I couldn't help but wonder... why is it that
her fandom clung to this brand for as long

541
00:34:19.971 --> 00:34:21.299
as they did?

542
00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:26.950
And… is there anything she could do to stick
the last nail in the coffin of her own career.

543
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:28.569
The thing with Rowling and Harry Potter is
that these are children’s books.

544
00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:29.569
While at the same time it was accessible,
it also didn’t talk down to it’s audience

545
00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:30.569
and laid out character intentions and feelings
that were easy to understand for children

546
00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:31.569
but complex enough to keep older readers engaged.

547
00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:32.569
And this isn’t to absolve Rowling of wrongdoing
because she wrote a good book.

548
00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:33.569
Yegch.

549
00:34:33.569 --> 00:34:34.569
That bothers me a lot.

550
00:34:34.569 --> 00:34:35.569
When people who don’t like Rowling stack
on and act like the Harry Potter books are

551
00:34:35.569 --> 00:34:36.569
trash either because she’s trash or because
the books are popular.

552
00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:37.569
But Harry Potter is also… well… kind of
a special case as far as book series go.

553
00:34:37.569 --> 00:34:38.569
At the time, nothing like it had ever happened
before.

554
00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:42.690
It STARTED as a children’s book… and then
grew up with the audience.

555
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:49.489
First, finding a niche in that young adult
period, and then by book seven kind of even

556
00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.619
reached toward the New Adult genre.

557
00:34:51.619 --> 00:34:55.649
not only did these books generate a paradigm
shift in the publishing industry, but they

558
00:34:55.649 --> 00:35:01.650
did so while managing to keep a group of children
interested in a series well into their teens

559
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.440
or even twenties.

560
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.279
When it comes to serialized children’s literature,
young readers who follow the series usually

561
00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:09.279
drop it as they grow out of the content.

562
00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:10.279
It isn’t until the series comes to a completion
that you get an audience who can read the

563
00:35:10.279 --> 00:35:11.279
entire backlog at once while they’re still
young.

564
00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:12.279
So… if harry potter had stayed as child-focused
as it started, then a lot of us probably would

565
00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:13.279
have cut and run before book five.

566
00:35:13.279 --> 00:35:14.279
Especially before book five.

567
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:15.279
But Harry Potter grew up with us.

568
00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.559
And we got to see the complexity of the books
unfold as our own lives were becoming more

569
00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:19.890
complex and independent.

570
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:25.459
So not only was Harry Potter beloved to our
childhood, but also our mid-and later teenage

571
00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:29.519
years — depending on how old you were when
you started reading it.

572
00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:33.190
And for those who had the opportunity to read
the whole series at once, you could see a

573
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.160
very… realistic progression of a developing
teenage identity.

574
00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:41.980
So in either case, the books stick with you,
and so you stick with the book from beginning

575
00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980
to end.

576
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.749
And in the process of being involved with
a series for seven instalments, that’s a

577
00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:50.390
lot of time and thought devoted to processing
this media.

578
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.299
Critically, at a period in your life where
you do not have a super developed capacity

579
00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:55.299
for critical thinking.

580
00:35:55.299 --> 00:36:00.079
At the same time that you are able to recognize
the morals of the story, you cannot recognize

581
00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:04.440
the way that this narration is conditioning
you to act a certain way.

582
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.680
And these morals are so very clearly directed
at cooperation, acceptance of the other, and

583
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.380
the strength and importance of the individual
existing within a community.

584
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.759
We see those values and we like those values.

585
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:23.890
So, until some of us are conditioned into
Randian, personal-gain, kind of objectivist

586
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:28.229
thinking, we do lean towards inclusion as
an innate state of default.

587
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:33.559
We don’t understand the social constructs
of why person from Racist group A can’t

588
00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:35.859
interact with person from diverse group B.

589
00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:41.910
This kind of segregation, as many have remarked,
is learned behaviour.

590
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:47.200
So the inclusive values in Harry Potter feel
natural to us as children.

591
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.730
And because most children don’t understand
the history of the IRA, and the colonial occupation

592
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.799
of Ireland, they aren’t going to be able
to critically discern WHY it’s a little

593
00:36:56.799 --> 00:37:04.640
problematic that the ONLY Irish student at
Hogwarts is constantly making things explode.

594
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.450
Same thing with the goblins.

595
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:12.759
We LEARN about the Holocaust and antisemitism
and stereotypes around Jewish people.

596
00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:16.670
So we do not have the innate ability to think
critically about the depiction of Goblins

597
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:21.539
being disturbingly close to how the Nazis
portrayed Jewish people in propaganda.

598
00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.209
Instead, we let this media shape us.

599
00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:30.359
Because a) we like it and b) it speaks to
values that we internally hold as truths.

600
00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:36.190
But we also do not have the ability to critically
think in a way where we can accept media and

601
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.920
separate the values we like from the values
we dislike.

602
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.720
It’s either all good, or all bad.

603
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.670
And quite frankly, a lot of adults are not
that well versed in critical thought either.

604
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.269
So as we accept Harry Potter as a component
of our formative development of values and

605
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:56.380
worldview, it, essentially, becomes a component
of our identities.

606
00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.640
And Harry Potter especially, because it was
produced and presented to the public on the

607
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.690
cusp of an era.

608
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.849
The year after the deathly hallows was released
the stock market crashed.

609
00:38:09.849 --> 00:38:15.380
Many of us immediately started getting called
lazy, expecting handouts, entitled, wanting

610
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.119
a trophy for showing up.

611
00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:22.640
Before then We were told that if we just did
what we loved, everything would work out.

612
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.890
We were told that fulfilment was the most
important part of getting a career.

613
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.280
And that money wasn’t as important as happiness.

614
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.660
…And then we were told to take that job
at starbucks, getting berated and verbally

615
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:41.209
abused by customers, and we were told to be
grateful we had anything at all.

616
00:38:41.209 --> 00:38:45.979
Our complaints about student debt fell on
deaf ears from generations who, when they

617
00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:51.150
were younger, started out with ‘nothing’
and made something of themselves.

618
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.769
In an age where they could get a family-supporting
job with a high school diploma.

619
00:38:54.769 --> 00:38:58.420
In an age where you could work part time and
put yourself through school, when minimum

620
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.119
wage was high enough and tuition was low enough
to do that.

621
00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:07.440
I for one, would have loved to start with
‘nothing’ rather than a heap of debt from

622
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.240
a degree I couldn’t really use to get that
fulfilment I was promised.

623
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.059
Everything didn’t just ‘work out’ because
we followed our dreams.

624
00:39:15.059 --> 00:39:19.039
In fact… we were told to… put our dreams
on hold.

625
00:39:19.039 --> 00:39:20.809
Or that we should just make it a hobby.

626
00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:21.809
Or just… wait until retirement.

627
00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:22.809
Or just realize that everyone doesn’t get
to be an astronaut and we should just settle

628
00:39:22.809 --> 00:39:24.799
for being a barista.

629
00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:28.619
Not speaking from personal experience, my
parents were incredibly encouraging.

630
00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:33.250
But many of us who had degrees and jobs at
starbucks had parents who thought that because

631
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.450
we didn’t have a job in our field it just
meant that we weren’t looking for them.

632
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.630
So many of our role models turned their backs
on us, and refused to listen to the reality

633
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.269
of our situation.

634
00:39:43.269 --> 00:39:48.059
Because it didn’t match up with what it
was like ‘when they were our age.’

635
00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:51.930
And according to them, the world, apparently,
was incapable of change.

636
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:57.239
By the time our role models realized that…
no… there isn’t just this trove of jobs

637
00:39:57.239 --> 00:40:02.280
out there, waiting for resumes dropped off
to the manager with a wink and a handshake.

638
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.339
By that time… we’d stopped caring what
they thought.

639
00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:12.650
We pushed away from our role models who built
up our expectations and did nothing to admit

640
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.329
that maybe… this wasn’t our fault.

641
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:20.170
…Except JK Rowling.

642
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:26.130
Who, famously, came from poverty and obscurity,
living in public housing, on social assistance,

643
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.619
getting fired from jobs because she was working
on her manuscript.

644
00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:34.890
Facing rejection, mental illness, abusive
people, her own role models, who did not believe

645
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:40.339
in her and in spite of all of it, she force
fed their words back to them and founded a

646
00:40:40.339 --> 00:40:44.829
creative empire on a dream and a little creativity.

647
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:49.710
She proved to us that our dreams were possible,
while telling us that the problems we complained

648
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.949
about were valid, and we had every right to
be angry.

649
00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:59.339
And we had every right to keep dreaming.

650
00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:03.460
Harry Potter was formative to our values,
and JK Rowling, now in the public eye, told

651
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:08.239
us that we didn’t have to abandon those
values to ‘fit in’ with what our once-mentors

652
00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.289
told us we had to be.

653
00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:12.910
What we had to sacrifice in order to succeed.

654
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:20.270
Without realizing that success, by their standards,
didn’t exist anymore, except for a few exceptions.

655
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:26.809
So, not only the books, but she herself was
formative in how we held on to our identity

656
00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:30.880
through a crisis nobody believed was happening.

657
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.130
And so no, people don’t want to admit she
did anything wrong.

658
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:42.140
To admit that she herself could turn into
an icon of the kind of wrong-minded, bigoted,

659
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:47.199
exclusionary, out-of-touch, ignorant, hateful,
tone-deaf, and unwilling to learn and grow

660
00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:51.039
and develop and accept new things, new ways
of thinking.

661
00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:56.630
To admit that she had become everything that
would have told her she would never succeed,

662
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.230
that we would never succeed…

663
00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.930
I got to admit, I’m not sure how that works.

664
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.380
Which is why we held on to Rowling for so
long.

665
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.930
Which is why I held on to that initial variant
of Rowling, the one that cut through hatred

666
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:18.460
and resistance so that people could flourish.

667
00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.460
Because that was the Rowling that we accepted.

668
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.229
So the new version… that must just be a
mistake.

669
00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:27.059
There must be a reason for that.

670
00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:28.980
Because these two versions are incompatible.

671
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.509
 It’s… almost impossible to get someone
to remove something that they consider to

672
00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:35.859
be part of their identity.

673
00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:39.539
Not like it’s their fault, human beings
are built to think that way.

674
00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:44.599
Our consciousness is designed to identify
itself by things that feel familiar.

675
00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:46.630
The opposite is what?

676
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.700
Cognitive dissonance?

677
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.359
We HAVE to hold on to what we identify with.

678
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:58.710
And if that thing is some rags to riches British
author... we have less agency in shaping ourselves

679
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.030
than we think.

680
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:06.119
And that’s especially true at younger ages
because we don’t realize that this fun book

681
00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:10.789
we’re reading is actually shaping our entire
identity.

682
00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:15.920
Which like… really should scare the shit
out of authors of Young Adult and Children’s

683
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.920
literature.

684
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.579
I mean you are developing a one-way line of
communication direct with a small person’s

685
00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:22.579
subconscious.

686
00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:26.680
And… they WILL absorb all the subliminal
messaging in there.

687
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.249
Whether it’s intended to be there or not.

688
00:43:29.249 --> 00:43:32.709
And that can stay with them for their entire
life.

689
00:43:32.709 --> 00:43:36.549
In the instance of Harry Potter, the value
on the surface is so strongly associated with

690
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:39.650
inclusion, we give it the benefit of the doubt.

691
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.039
Because… we are biased creatures.

692
00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:49.039
And in many cases We aren’t aware of what
those biases are.

693
00:43:49.039 --> 00:43:54.509
For instance, it’s not likely that Tolkein
deliberately intended to code th forces of

694
00:43:54.509 --> 00:43:56.999
Mordor as representatives of dark-skinned
individuals.

695
00:43:56.999 --> 00:44:01.489
He was trying to establish a dichotomy between
darkness and light, and didn’t understand,

696
00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:07.069
and did not live in an era where it was projected
that skin colour ought to be treated sensitively.

697
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:13.519
And because Tolkein never did something that
was like… errantly hateful, most people

698
00:44:13.519 --> 00:44:18.569
can separate the surface value meaning from
the problematic instances.

699
00:44:18.569 --> 00:44:21.479
And I thought, for a while, that I could do
that with Harry Potter.

700
00:44:21.479 --> 00:44:26.890
You know, just kinda… remove Rowling’s
gender politics and enjoy what was in the

701
00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:27.890
rest of the books.

702
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.119
But now it just hangs off my back.

703
00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:36.979
Weighing down the love I have for her creation.

704
00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:40.510
And killing the admiration I had for her.

705
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:44.710
PART SIX: The Half-Depressed Prince

706
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:50.729
Every September 1, people around the world
celebrate the day that students go to Hogwarts,

707
00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:57.232
with many proclaiming on social media “It’s
time to go home”.

708
00:44:57.232 --> 00:45:01.039
It’s almost reached religious levels of
devotion, with some fans making the pilgrimage

709
00:45:01.039 --> 00:45:06.849
to Kings Cross Station, congregating at the
little sign in between platforms nine and

710
00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:11.809
ten, and counting down to when the train leaves
at 11:00am sharp.

711
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:16.329
Others opt to travel to Universal Studios,
where they can wander around Diagon Alley,

712
00:45:16.329 --> 00:45:20.930
being fitted for their robes, receiving their
very own wand, and then casting their gaze

713
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.089
toward the reproduction of Hogwarts that looms
high above the land.

714
00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:26.650
I never really got to partake in any of that,
mind you.

715
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:31.240
I didn’t have the money to travel to London
for September 1, or to go to Universal Studios

716
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.289
and visit Diagon Alley.

717
00:45:33.289 --> 00:45:34.819
Not in time, anyway.

718
00:45:34.819 --> 00:45:37.900
Not before Rowling… did the things.

719
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:43.529
There’s even a head canon reason why fans
of a certain generation, mine, never got their

720
00:45:43.529 --> 00:45:46.130
letters to go to Hogwarts.

721
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:49.890
Because of Voldemort’s power grab in the
seventh book, all documentation tracking muggles

722
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.229
with magical powers was destroyed.

723
00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:57.760
And therefor, after 1997, no eleven year old
without wizard parents got their letters.

724
00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.990
It’s a silly and fun way to let the magical
idea of Hogwarts live on.

725
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:07.249
That we actually are witches and wizards,
we just didn’t get our letters because a

726
00:46:07.249 --> 00:46:11.410
mad fascist didn’t want us included.

727
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:15.839
And In 2012, Harry Potter fans around the
world cheered Britain’s then Prime Minister

728
00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:21.910
David Cameron’s declaration that May 2 would
forevermore be known as International Harry

729
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.119
Potter Day.

730
00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:25.589
Why May 2?

731
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:28.410
The Battle of Hogwarts was fought on this
date in 1998.

732
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:32.259
The final conflict of the Second Wizarding
War.

733
00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:37.599
The Order of the Phoenix proved victorious,
ending the most devastating battle of that

734
00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:44.199
war and resulting in numerous casualties,
including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Lavender

735
00:46:44.199 --> 00:46:48.499
Brown, Colin Creavey, Severus Snape, and Fred
Weasley.

736
00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:52.619
But most notably the defeat of Lord Voldemort,
or Tom Riddle.

737
00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:56.059
Every year brings different ways to commemorate
and celebrate this day.

738
00:46:56.059 --> 00:47:03.140
There are anniversaries to recognize, characters
to memorialize, places to see.

739
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:08.170
In Cameron’s official statement announcing
the new holiday he said “In order to fully

740
00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:14.440
commemorate and immortalize her work, we have
decided to officially declare May 2nd as an

741
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:21.489
official international holiday, in honor of
the date that protagonist Harry Potter conquered

742
00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:25.459
the main antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort.

743
00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:30.170
We hope that children and adults alike will
be reminded of Harry Potter’s strong and

744
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:35.039
courageous character on this day, as well
as of the true credit that Ms. Rowling has

745
00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:37.140
made to society.”

746
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.489
In case you can’t tell, this is not the
typical.

747
00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:44.519
This isn’t usually what people do after
a book series has ended.

748
00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:47.029
It’s become something beyond its creator.

749
00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:51.719
JK Rowling gets the credits for all of this,
in an official sense, being the creator.

750
00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:56.430
But she didn’t organize the pilgrimages
to Kings Cross.

751
00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:01.279
She hasn’t been the one keeping the series
alive with countless theory videos and head

752
00:48:01.279 --> 00:48:04.180
canon explanations across the internet.

753
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.249
She just confirms them sometimes.

754
00:48:06.249 --> 00:48:10.789
And when she comes up with her own, its about
Wizards crapping on the ground and magicking

755
00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:12.039
it away with their wand.

756
00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:15.540
The fans are the people who have kept this
brand alive since the books finished their

757
00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:23.960
run in 2007, the year I graduated from high
school, and the final film was released in

758
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960
2011.

759
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.189
Long before Rowling officially launched Pottermore
in 2015, (everything before then was considered

760
00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:34.339
a beta), fans had been doing the hard work
of keeping their favourite characters alive.

761
00:48:34.339 --> 00:48:36.829
Fans took ownership of the the characters.

762
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:40.729
Fan fiction communities for Harry Potter had
always been popular, but they really took

763
00:48:40.729 --> 00:48:43.449
off once the series had finished.

764
00:48:43.449 --> 00:48:45.789
People were telling their own stories in the
world.

765
00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.339
Creating their own characters.

766
00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:50.559
Adding to the mythology.

767
00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:56.819
And a whole lot of the people behind those
new stories were queer and trans.

768
00:48:56.819 --> 00:49:00.859
People who understood that Rowling couldn’t
include people like us in the initial books

769
00:49:00.859 --> 00:49:05.779
because of the then existing UK law that said
books with LGBT characters weren’t allowed

770
00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:08.180
in children’s libraries.

771
00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:13.519
So we assumed that was the only reason we
weren’t there, and many of us created out

772
00:49:13.519 --> 00:49:16.009
own stories to fill in the gaps.

773
00:49:16.009 --> 00:49:21.660
Creating new characters to exist right alongside
Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

774
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.660
And why wouldn’t we?

775
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:29.109
In 2014 JK Rowling stated, very clearly, that
gay, lesbian, bi, AND transgender students

776
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:32.109
could, of course, attend Hogwarts.

777
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:37.309
She even said that they may use magic to help
deal with gender confirmation.

778
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:42.420
She didn’t use those exact words of course,
instead clinically stating that one could

779
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.220
change their genitals, but the meaning was
still there.

780
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.279
So It’s no wonder her being a TERF came
like a punch to the gut to so many.

781
00:49:49.279 --> 00:49:53.910
And why so many people, myself very much included,
preferred to ignore her slights on Twitter

782
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.170
until it became impossible to do so.

783
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:06.849
Until she went out of her way to remove that
last shadow of a doubt that so many of us

784
00:50:06.849 --> 00:50:07.849
clung to.

785
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:10.390
And it sucks.

786
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.660
I hate it.

787
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.989
I hate that I defended her.

788
00:50:13.989 --> 00:50:16.900
I hate that I ignored her growing transphobia.

789
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.199
But most of all, I hate that I had to.

790
00:50:21.199 --> 00:50:27.109
I hate that she put me and so many fans, gay,
straight, bi, cis, trans, non-binary…

791
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:31.819
That she put us in the position of HAVING
to ignore her ignorant and potentially dangerous

792
00:50:31.819 --> 00:50:32.819
comments.

793
00:50:32.819 --> 00:50:37.959
Because she had helped us form our identities
as accepting, loving, people.

794
00:50:37.959 --> 00:50:42.569
The ones who would help the first years at
Hogwarts feel comfortable in their new home.

795
00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:46.410
No matter where they came from, what they
looked like, or what dormitory they slept

796
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.410
in.

797
00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:52.259
Over the course of just a few short years
Joanne Rowling went from being the most tolerant,

798
00:50:52.259 --> 00:50:56.900
accepting, loving professor at Hogwarts…
to She Who Must Not Be Named.

799
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:02.700
And while doing so she created her own hoard
of TERFY death eaters to go along with her,

800
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.400
leaving the rest of us heartbroken at the
betrayal, and trying to figure out what to

801
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.240
do next.

802
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.540
Do we cut Harry Potter out of our lives.

803
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.920
Or just it’s creator?

804
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.410
Do we have to let go of something that made
us feel so happy and safe?

805
00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.319
Or can we just let go of her?

806
00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:21.749
Can there be Harry Potter without JK Rowling?

807
00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:22.749
PART SEVEN: The Deathly Acceptance

808
00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:26.230
(At desk with Harry Potter perch everywhere)

809
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:33.210
I’ve been asking myself that question at
least once a week for the last year and a

810
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:34.210
half.

811
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:39.809
Can I still enjoy Harry Potter, even though
JK Rowling is who, it turns out, she is.

812
00:51:39.809 --> 00:51:41.650
Can I still read the books?

813
00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:42.799
Watch the movies?

814
00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:43.799
Play a video game?

815
00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:44.799
Buy lego.

816
00:51:44.799 --> 00:51:45.809
Can I play with my wands?

817
00:51:45.809 --> 00:51:50.989
I have Slytherin and Ravenclaw scarves and
this past winter, on the very rare occasion

818
00:51:50.989 --> 00:51:54.730
I got to leave the house, I felt like I couldn’t
wear them.

819
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.630
What about my Hogwarts backpack?

820
00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:01.229
Can I still use that without feeling like
I’m promoting TERF ideology?

821
00:52:01.229 --> 00:52:06.979
I know that for people for whom Harry Potter
was just another book or movie, this probably

822
00:52:06.979 --> 00:52:08.839
sounds crazy.

823
00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:14.739
I feel like it would be akin to Marvel fans
finding out that Stan Lee was secretly fighting

824
00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:19.920
against civil rights in America, or that George
Lucas secretly financed the January 6th attack

825
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.210
on the capital.

826
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:26.249
It’s just so antithetical to the image we
have of these people.

827
00:52:26.249 --> 00:52:32.509
But luckily, in reality, Stan Lee was a pretty
progressive guy who loved adding diversity

828
00:52:32.509 --> 00:52:34.809
to the Marvel Comics universe.

829
00:52:34.809 --> 00:52:39.119
And George Lucas abhors fascism, in case the
bad guys in Star Wars being space nazis was

830
00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:40.119
too subtle for you.

831
00:52:40.119 --> 00:52:45.109
But how does someone deal with discovering
that a person who helped them develop their

832
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:51.499
identity is… bad?

833
00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:55.599
People who read Orson Scott Card books as
a kid had to do it when they founds out he

834
00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:57.529
was actually a raging homophobe.

835
00:52:57.529 --> 00:53:04.559
HP Lovecraft was a virulent racist and anti-semite…
but his world has been adopted since his death,

836
00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:13.239
with countless Jewish writer and writers of
color making his mythos safe for everyone.

837
00:53:13.239 --> 00:53:15.630
So it’s not a new phenomena.

838
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.150
But certainly nothing like it has happened
at this scale.

839
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.130
No modern author has had the reach of JK Rowling.

840
00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.109
The cultural permeability.

841
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:30.219
Harry Potter has sold over 500 million copies.

842
00:53:30.219 --> 00:53:33.619
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
is the bestselling single novel of all time.

843
00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:37.209
With the other six books in the series all
landing within the top 20 bestselling books

844
00:53:37.209 --> 00:53:38.209
of all time.

845
00:53:38.209 --> 00:53:39.209
Rowling is the only author to have more than
one book in that top twenty, and she’s got

846
00:53:39.209 --> 00:53:40.209
seven.

847
00:53:40.209 --> 00:53:43.989
That has lead to a level of global cultural
osmosis never before seen in literature.

848
00:53:43.989 --> 00:53:47.650
For some kids it was just another book they
read, or movie they saw.

849
00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.670
But for many it changed how they looked at
the world.

850
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:56.039
It gave them a safe place to go when the real
world was falling apart around them.

851
00:53:56.039 --> 00:54:01.039
There are reports of young Syrian refugees
and South American migrants clutching onto

852
00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:06.380
copies of Harry Potter books as they flee
from the horrors of war or destitution.

853
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.759
Because although bombs fall around them, and
gunshots ring throughout the night…

854
00:54:09.759 --> 00:54:13.459
Hogwarts makes them feel safe.

855
00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:18.730
And so I don’t think we can demand people
give that up.

856
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.569
As I’ve said already, I know more than a
few trans people who have increased their

857
00:54:22.569 --> 00:54:24.749
love of Harry Potter to spite Rowling.

858
00:54:24.749 --> 00:54:29.339
To show her and the people who support her
that they cannot take this away from them.

859
00:54:29.339 --> 00:54:33.900
That Harry, and Hagrid, and Hermione, and
Ron, and the other Weaselys, mean something

860
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.970
to them.

861
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:40.980
That Neville and Luna and Cho and Dean were
their friends when, maybe, they had none.

862
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:46.150
That Molly Weasly was a loving and accepting
mother figure.

863
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:52.329
That Professor McDonagall was a teacher they
wish they’d had to talk to.

864
00:54:52.329 --> 00:54:56.259
If you want to cut this out of your life because
of the things Rowling has said, I do not blame

865
00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.670
you at all.

866
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.410
With countries all over the world passing
anti-trans laws, adding her voice to the mix

867
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.989
has only fanned the flames of transphobia.

868
00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:09.060
But if you want to keep these characters and
this world in your life to spite her, I support

869
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.619
that too.

870
00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:15.489
Because the minute those books hit the bookshelves
they became just as much the fan’s property

871
00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:16.809
as her own.

872
00:55:16.809 --> 00:55:21.930
She might legally own them, but a brand is
nothing without the fans.

873
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.920
There’s an entire generation of people who
grew up escaping to Hogwarts.

874
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.699
Who feel comfortable and safe within those
walls… within the pages of the books…

875
00:55:30.699 --> 00:55:33.029
or the scenes of the movies.

876
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:35.660
I’m one of them.

877
00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.489
And honestly, I’m not letting her have the
power to take that away from me.

878
00:55:40.489 --> 00:55:43.410
Will I spend anymore money on the brand?

879
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.410
Probably not.

880
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:48.279
But I’m not letting it go entirely.

881
00:55:48.279 --> 00:55:53.819
I accept that she is not who I thought she
was.

882
00:55:53.819 --> 00:56:01.069
But the beautiful thing about books is that,
for the most part, they’re unchanging.

883
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:06.950
Harry still comes from an abusive home, and
finds his security in a chosen family.

884
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:09.999
Hermione still fights for the rights of the
oppressed, even though they’re different

885
00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:12.670
from her.

886
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:18.449
Molly Weasely is still the mother figure that
will hug you and care for you, no matter what.

887
00:56:18.449 --> 00:56:22.789
Sirius is still the godfather that will make
you laugh, and put his life on the line for

888
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:25.229
you.

889
00:56:25.229 --> 00:56:27.349
Dobby is still the devoted friend.

890
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:30.059
McGonagall still the caring teacher.

891
00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:33.719
Hagrid still the father figure that will guide
you through the dark.

892
00:56:33.719 --> 00:56:38.949
They’re all still there within the pages
and on the screen.

893
00:56:38.949 --> 00:56:43.690
Inside a worn paperback or old DVD you got
as a kid or a teenager.

894
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:50.219
And on September 1, you can still return to
Hogwarts without putting a single Knut, sickle,

895
00:56:50.219 --> 00:56:54.019
or galleon in Rowling’s pocket.

896
00:56:54.019 --> 00:56:56.460
Rowling did her job.

897
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.789
She wrote the books.

898
00:56:57.789 --> 00:57:01.069
But They’re yours now.

899
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:02.609
Always.
