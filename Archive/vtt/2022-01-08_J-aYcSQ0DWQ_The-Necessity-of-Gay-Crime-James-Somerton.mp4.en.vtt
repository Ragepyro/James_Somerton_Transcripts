00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.720
I grew up poor, though I didn’t know it. 
My parents worked very hard to shield me  

2
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.360
from the fact that certain bills would be paid 
on alternating months, since there was never  

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.040
enough money to pay everything, that we lived in 
low-income housing, and that even then a portion  

4
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.760
of our rent each month was covered by my father 
mowing the lawns and shovelling the drive ways  

5
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.280
of other houses in the housing group. I never 
knew that my mother would borrow money from  

6
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.400
relatives to make sure that I had Christmas, 
and then pay it back over the next few months.

7
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720
I never knew these things when I was a kid. I 
didn’t find out until I was a teenager and my  

8
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.720
parents separated. When suddenly very 
little money became a whole lot less.  

9
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.040
When my mother and I had to move 
into a house so poorly insulated  

10
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
that the first floor was never, ever warm. 
It got so frigid that you had to run up the  

11
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.760
stairs when you made food in the winter or else 
it’d be cold by the time you got to your room.

12
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.960
But almost everyone I knew was in the same 
situation. I was lucky enough to be an only child,  

13
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.920
so I had it a lot easier than my friends, who 
had to share what little they got with multiple  

14
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.840
siblings. And so in order to get by, crime was 
just a fact of life. But nobody looked at it  

15
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.840
as really breaking the law, because 
people weren’t stealing from each other.

16
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.520
They were stealing from Walmart or other big 
stores. Things would just fall off the back of  

17
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.360
a truck. For most of the people I grew up with you 
were getting a game console for Christmas or your  

18
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.560
birthday, it meant that Best Buy’s inventory 
was missing a few Xbox’s or PlayStations.

19
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.080
Almost every adult I knew worked under the table, 
their employer paying them without claiming them  

20
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.280
as an employee, and that way neither of them had 
to pay taxes. The whole area I grew up in was  

21
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.440
peppered with bartenders, fishermen, mechanics, 
repairmen, maids, cleaners, you name it. All of  

22
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.920
them working under the table. Because the island I 
grew up on had its economy completely collapse in  

23
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.560
the 1980s when the coal mines and steel mills, 
which had been the economic lifeblood of the  

24
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.480
place for over a hundred years, were sold off to 
a German energy conglomerate and then closed down.

25
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600
Everyone lost their jobs, their benefits,  

26
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.840
and their hope. And since so many people had 
been injured on the job throughout the years,  

27
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.280
taking pain killers to keep working, they were 
suddenly without the ability to pay for the meds  

28
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.760
too. So they had to start buying pain meds from 
family who had pensioned out, and therefore had  

29
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.000
drug plans, in order to do the backbreaking jobs 
that they could manage to find. Which, sadly,  

30
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.240
led to my hometown getting the nickname of 
CottonTown, because OxyContin was its main import.

31
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.120
This video isn’t my autobiography though, or 
about the town I grew up. There’s been enough  

32
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.840
news coverage about that little island going to 
hell in a hand basket for a hundred video essays.  

33
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.560
But I just wanted to set the scene 
so you understand where I’m coming  

34
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.360
when I talk about the necessity of crime in 
certain situations. How not all criminals  

35
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.120
are bad people, and how a lot of people are 
shunted into the category of criminal because  

36
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.120
of where society has placed them, and how 
successful society will allow them to become.

37
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:31.840
All of this so that I can talk about Banana Fish.

38
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.320
If you’re not into relatively obscure violent, 
crime anime based on 30 year old manga,  

39
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.200
you probably have no idea what Banana Fish 
is. I sure as hell didn’t. I thought it was  

40
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.640
either a disgusting sushi dish, or a really smelly 
banana. And then I sat down to watch it, which was  

41
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.960
a blessedly easy process thanks to Amazon Prime 
Video, and binged the 24 episodes in two days.

42
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.600
And see, I get headaches if I look at screens 
for too long, so watching subtitled media  

43
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.640
is kind of hard for me. And since Banana Fish 
doesn’t have an English dub, I had to grin and  

44
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.560
bear a pounding headache to get through it. 
But I had to. I had to find out what happens.

45
00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.200
Banana Fish is a 2018 anime, based on the 
1985 manga by Akimi Yoshida, that deals with  

46
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.720
organised crime in New York City, all the way from 
street gangs, where our main character Ash exists,  

47
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.280
to mafia-like organisations, all the way up 
to political power players like US senators.

48
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.280
But really, REALLY, it's about the relationship 
between the tough American street kid, Ash,  

49
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.320
and an innocent young Japanese photographer, 
Eiji. Ash isn’t your typical gang banger though.  

50
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.080
He spends more time in the New York Public library 
than in drug dens, is well read, has a dark past  

51
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.120
he prefers to keep secret from most people, and 
has a hard time seeing a life that doesn’t involve  

52
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.600
violence and pain. He’s shrouded in a cloud of 
pessimism, while Eiji is eternally optimistic.

53
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.360
The series cold opens during the Iraq war, an 
American soldier named Griffin fires on his own  

54
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.360
squad in an apparent mental breakdown. He is 
subdued when Max, a friend and fellow soldier,  

55
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.560
shoots him in the legs. As Griffin 
collapses, he mutters… "banana fish".

56
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.480
Twelve years later, Griffin, 
now essentially catatonic,  

57
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.280
is cared for by his younger brother Ash, the 
leader of a street gang in New York. One night,  

58
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.360
Ash encounters a dying man who gives him a vial of 
an unknown substance and an address in California;  

59
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.800
the man says the words "banana fish" before dying.

60
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.840
Ash begins to investigate the meaning of "banana 
fish", though he is impeded by Dino Golzine,  

61
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.200
a Corsican mob boss who has groomed Ash as 
a child to be his sex slave and heir to his  

62
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.600
criminal empire. He’s not very happy that 
Ash has managed to gain some independence,  

63
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320
and wants his trophy boy back.

64
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.520
In the course of Ash’s investigation, Ash 
meets Eiji Okumura, a photographer’s assistant,  

65
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.160
who travelled from Japan 
to report on street gangs.  

66
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.840
He’s immediately intrigued by the older boys 
innocence and his… pole vaulting prowess.

67
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640
I’m sure there’s a double entendre there.

68
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.480
When Ash ends up in prison after 
being, more or less, framed for murder,  

69
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.040
he’s visited by Eiji and slips him a note by,  

70
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.960
well, sticking his tongue down his throat. 
Which Eiji really doesn’t seem to mind one bit.

71
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.840
The note gives Eiji directions on how to help Ash 
via getting word to an associate in ChinaTown.  

72
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.880
Things go awry though. One thing leads 
to another and Ash’s brother, Griffin  

73
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.440
is killed in the crossfire between two gangs.

74
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.280
Ash soon makes bail, finds out about his 
brother's death, and swears revenge on the  

75
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.280
people who killed him. Eiji, being a wee bit 
pig-headed, demands to come too, along with  

76
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.160
a few other people who more or less want to help 
Ash revenge his way across New York’s underworld.  

77
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.800
But first they need to take a trip to California, 
to the address Ash was given by the dying man.

78
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.240
On their way there they make a little stop over 
in the small hamlet Ash spent most of his early  

79
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.160
childhood in. This is where we see the hardened 
criminal open up to Eiji, using the process of  

80
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.960
teaching him how to handle a pistol to get close 
to him. After Gozine’s men find them though,  

81
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.080
a shootout ensues, but our main team make it out 
alive and get back on the road to California.

82
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.480
Once there they find a mansion occupied 
by a man revealed to be Lee Yut-Lung,  

83
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.440
the youngest son of China's largest crime family. 
They later encounter the home's true occupant,  

84
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.880
a doctor who informs them that 
Banana Fish is an untraceable  

85
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.760
drug that brainwashes its users — turning 
them into near thoughtless murder machines.

86
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.680
Golzine intends to sell the drug to the 
United States government, which seeks  

87
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.120
to use it to overthrow communist and leftist 
regimes in South America. This sounds absurd,  

88
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.720
but look up some of the stuff Regan did in South 
America in the 1980s. It’s not that far-fetched.

89
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.880
The group is almost immediately captured by 
Golzine's men and taken back to New York.  

90
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.120
Once there, Shorter Wong, Ash’s best friend, is 
injected with the Banana Fish serum to show off  

91
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.800
what it can do. He’s instructed to kill Eiji. 
Shorter attacks Eiji in a frenzy, though in a  

92
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.800
moment of lucidity, he is able to beg Ash to 
kill him. Ash is given a gun with one bullet…  

93
00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:02.240
Kill Shorter, or kill himself. He shoots and kills 
his best friend to prevent him from killing Eiji.

94
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.360
This sends Ash into a violent spiral, and he 
ends up cutting a bloody swath through Golzine’s  

95
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.640
mansion in order to save Eiji once again, after 
he’d been locked away by the mob boss’s men.  

96
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.600
Ash rescues him and the mansion is set ablaze.

97
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.120
Once in hiding, Ash and Eiji are 
able to have another calm moment.  

98
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.000
Their first since before leaving for 
California. Where we learn that Ash has…  

99
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.920
a very bad temper and no patience when 
it comes to his goons, especially when  

100
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.640
it involves his sleep. He can violently react 
to being woken up… but not when Eiji does it.

101
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.400
As the story moves forward, 
becoming more and more complex,  

102
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.720
involving intergang rivalries, financial 
espionage, and ghosts from Ash’s past…  

103
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.760
Ash and Eiji become more and more the focus 
of the story, with even the opening titles  

104
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.640
changing to make it even clearer that 
these two are more than just friends.

105
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.080
But in the end, as the series comes 
to a close, we’re given a chance  

106
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.760
to hope that this story may just have a happy 
ending. Though Eiji is safely heading back  

107
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.120
to Japan while Ash remains in New York, his 
enemies seemingly vanquished, Eiji does leave  

108
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.480
the door open for Ash to join him by giving 
him a prepaid ticket to join him in Japan.

109
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.080
An ongoing thread throughout the series 
is how much more dangerous America  

110
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.840
is than The Land of the Rising Sun, and that Ash 
is too kind a person to not have a peaceful life.

111
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.200
It seems like Ash is going to take Eiji up on 
his offer, but while reading the letter Edji left  

112
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.880
behind for him, he’s stabbed by, seemingly, the 
last person in New York who might want him dead.  

113
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.760
Ash kills the assailant, but may be mortally 
wounded himself. He manages to bring himself  

114
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.920
back to the New York Public library. The place 
he’s always had the most peace. While Eiji waits  

115
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:55.200
for him at the airport, hope wafting away, 
Ash lays his head down on a table and dies.

116
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.480
RECORD SCRATCH

117
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.360
No he doesn’t die, goddammit. 
And this isn’t me saying,  

118
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.280
no he doesn’t die because he and Eiji are too 
cute together, and he doesn’t deserve to die.

119
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.200
I have proof!

120
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.280
As the show was airing the banana fish website 
kept an up to date tracker of which major  

121
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.840
characters were dead, and which were alive. More 
and more characters having their image and names  

122
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.600
greyed out as the show went along. When the 
series finale first aired, Ash’s photo and name  

123
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:28.880
became greyed out but very soon after, went back 
to color. Which means… he’s not dead. Like I said.

124
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.640
He DOES die in the manga, but plenty changed 
from the Manga to the Anime, And since we see  

125
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.320
Ash take a hell of a lot more punishment 
than a knife wound throughout the series,  

126
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.720
I’m not willing to believe that he’s dead. 
And there’s too many plot threads left open  

127
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.480
for a sequel. So you’re not going to 
change my mind on this. Our blond Mary  

128
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.760
Sue with the dead eye aim, master hacker 
capabilities, and sky high IQ is alive.

129
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.240
Anyway.

130
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.320
The relationship between Ash and Eiji in Banana 
fish is a lot like that of Victor and Yuri  

131
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.040
in Yuri on Ice. It’s subtle, but not queer 
coding. And I think it works best that way.  

132
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.480
Many older men in the show 
who are portrayed as “gay”  

133
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.840
could easily be read as straight by anyone who 
understands the psychology of sexual predators.

134
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.400
They don’t fall in love with men, they abuse 
them. Especially men below the legal age.

135
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.360
For them, it’s a power fantasy, just 
like with sexual predators in real life.  

136
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.360
Ash himself was forced into the life of a 
sex slave through his early teen years at  

137
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.120
the hands of Golzine, but escapes 
that life of abuse and organized,  

138
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.280
white color crime by turning to a life 
of petty, and not so petty, crime.

139
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.560
The sexual pradators in and around Golzine’s orbit 
are just that, predators. Not necessarily gay men.  

140
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.080
But Ash and Eiji… we never see them have sex. 
There’s a kiss, almost as soon as they meet,  

141
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.920
but that’s shown as passing on information 
that Ash needs to smuggle out of prison.

142
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.640
Ash using Eiji as a means to an end, just like 
he’s been used throughout his life. But over  

143
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.160
time he doesn’t just come to like and respect 
Eiji, but he falls in love with him. Sharing  

144
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:19.840
with him parts of himself that he thoroughly 
kept hidden from everyone else in his life.

145
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.000
Eiji, on the other hand, begins the story as an 
innocent, almost damsel in distress type. Who,  

146
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.920
over the course of the series, becomes 
willing to break more and more laws,  

147
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.840
but only to save Ash’s life. In a series 
filled with criminals of all ranks and sorts,  

148
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.840
Eiji is only willing to become one to 
save the life of the person he loves.

149
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:51.120
Showing the audience that desperate times can make 
a criminal out of anyone. Even the most innocent,  

150
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.240
sweet hearted boy in the world. Ash even gets 
angry with him when he does break the law, even  

151
00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.840
to rescue Ash, because he wants Eiji to keep being 
the good guy, and not get drawn into this world.

152
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.960
Crime, for Ash, is a way of life. It’s how he 
survived as long as he has. And while a queer  

153
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.360
protagnost being a violent criminal may have 
some suburban gays clutching their pearls,  

154
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.920
Watching the show, I didn’t bat an eye.

155
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:29.840
Because a relationship between queer people 
and criminal behaviour isn’t at all new.

156
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.360
Though it may be a rallying cry and a 
meme now, ‘Be Gay Do Crime’ was once a  

157
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.160
matter of propaganda against queer communities. 
Established powers throughout the better part  

158
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.680
of the last two hundred years at least, meant to 
warn people about the degeneracy of queer people  

159
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:52.720
and illicit lifestyles. Drugs, crime, sex, 
death, and worse — unchristianly thoughts.

160
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.360
The public image of gay people, then referred 
to as ‘sexual inversion’ or ‘sexual deviants’  

161
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.280
was generally expected to be 
poor and dirty, or predatory.

162
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.120
Granted, though, this was at the 
same time of European history  

163
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.040
when England had to launch a 
multimedia effort that included  

164
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.440
posters, pamphlets, anglican church missives, 
fiction, and even spreading via word of  

165
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.880
mouth — NOT to send your boys to Italy. 
Rich families noticed that after their sons  

166
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.520
toured Europe, something about them would 
change after they spent a few months in Italy.

167
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.360
The combination of a prevalent casual approach 
towards sex, a culture focused around pursuing  

168
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.560
artistic romance, and simply being one of the 
most scenic landmasses on the damn planet,  

169
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:43.040
usually culminated in cold, English boys’ 
sexual hang-ups being eroded by the hordes  

170
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.080
of beautiful Italians with a ‘when in Rome’ 
attitude when it came to 69ing with other guys.

171
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.440
And that’s to say nothing of queer 
hotspots in Europe throughout history.  

172
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.840
The Netherlands, Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen,  

173
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.920
Munich, Vienna – even pre-world-war Turkey. That 
isn’t to say that you could live a queer life  

174
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.040
without consequences in these places, though Italy 
stood out to conservative Europe as there was a  

175
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.320
degree of tolerance even within 
rural sections of the country.

176
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.840
It’s hard to be proud of a national 
history that was established by a bunch  

177
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.800
of bisexual senators and emperors 
and cling to casual homophobia.

178
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.600
The real threat  

179
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.600
were the scandalous solicitors in Hyde Park! 
Or… something, something, hide your children.

180
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.400
In a way… even in modern media, we… somewhat… 
continue to propagate that line of thinking.

181
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.640
Though the clean, suburban-friendly gay dad 
may be the consencus media portrayal of gay  

182
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.800
men now — to the point where depicting gay men in 
an area of criminality is now something that will  

183
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.720
get you blacklisted by the HRC - we are wrought 
with depictions of trans and bisexual people who  

184
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.120
are either poor, dependant on criminal income, 
or the overused trope of the bisexual villain.  

185
00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.560
Whose ubiquitous sex drive OBVIOUSLY means they’re 
hypersexual and promiscuous. And therefore evil.

186
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.400
As gay men and women begin to push their newfound 
influence into the business of media production,  

187
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.200
the gay criminal has shifted to the 
bisexual criminal, or the trans criminal.  

188
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.320
And media which still depicts gay people as 
criminals has become exceedingly uncommon.

189
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.400
And yet, within the queer community 
remains a solidarity with crime,  

190
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.160
and with resistance to the law. Why is that?

191
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.160
Well… unfortunately, this is one of those 
instances in which state-produced propaganda was…  

192
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.960
not really wrong.

193
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.800
Propaganda about queer links to crime was only 
really dishonest for omitting queer elites. But  

194
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.840
it was not dishonest about the fact that London’s 
West End was once a very colourful neighbourhood.  

195
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.440
Hyde park after dark, famously became a venue for 
sexual exhibitionism and sex work solicitation.  

196
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.240
Drugs, stolen goods, and unsavoury types all drove 
property values in the district down. This allowed  

197
00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.800
the torrents of disowned queer people to have a 
place to live in a city that saw them as scum.

198
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.080
And as the queer class was considered undesirable,  

199
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.240
upstanding businesses usually 
refused to take them on payroll.  

200
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.000
Many who wished to be open or at least who were 
unable to be closeted, needed to take work where  

201
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.200
they could get it. And sometimes, that wasn’t 
always by taking jobs your mama would approve of.  

202
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.960
For younger ones, that meant prostitution. Leading 
to the rise of the famous London Rent-Boy culture.

203
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.680
By omitting the fact that fancy boys travelling 
to and from Italy would return with homosexual  

204
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.640
liberation, media and political messaging 
perpetuated the idea that homosexuality  

205
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.240
automatically brought delinquency. And 
then used that as justification, in part,  

206
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.640
for the systemic persecution of gay men 
and the attempted persecution of gay women.

207
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.040
Beyond England, presenting the link between 
homosexuality and crime as a simple fact  

208
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.480
is part of virtually every national 
effort to persecute gay people.  

209
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.440
(And trans people as they became more visible.)

210
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.320
So what? Am I agreeing with the link 
that queer people and crime is inherrant?

211
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:08.480
No… I’m saying that a link between crime and any 
kind of ‘second class citizen’ is inevitable.

212
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.800
I’ve touched on this before and it’s worth 
mentioning again. Oscar Wilde, renowned author,  

213
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.400
editor, playwright, poet, businessman, and 
darling of the English theatre at his hayday,  

214
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.600
was also infamously one of those high-profile 
buggery cases that the English government wishes  

215
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.600
people would really just forget about. His very 
public prosecution, once used to fighten little  

216
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.440
gay children, is now a source of national 
embarrassment for the British parliament.

217
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.000
(As if they don’t have enough to 
be embarrassed about, already.)

218
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.960
Oscar Wilde, leading up to the trial, was 
heavily engaged in the English queer underground,  

219
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.240
and factored in a number of his 
observations into his writing.  

220
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.680
Across several of his works, he explored the 
idea of an ‘illicit identity.’ If there is an  

221
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.480
identity which the state considers ‘illegal’ 
— what does that do to someone’s psychology?

222
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.720
If, for instance, the penalty for having red hair  

223
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.960
is the same criminal punishment as smoking 
opium (and the English do like to pretend  

224
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.880
red-heads ought to be illegal) — if you have 
red hair… why not smoke a heap of opium?

225
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.360
If the consequences for simply existing are the 
same as criminal behaviour, then it’s not like  

226
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.680
actively deciding to be a criminal is gonna 
make it all that much worse for you, is it?

227
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.080
Why not do all those fast-living, 
young-dying, acts of delinquency that  

228
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.680
your parents warned you are things ‘propper’ 
folk would never do? Vandalise property,  

229
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.800
pick some pockets, lift some goods off the 
back of that waggon, break into that house,  

230
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.560
smoke all these drugs, go with a band of 
dwarves to steal some gold from a dragon.

231
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.680
If living a criminal life and holding 
the wrong person’s hand are going to get  

232
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.960
you the same sentencing — or worse — why not 
live an exciting life before you get caught?

233
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.080
And then because some in the minority group can 
be found guilty of a certain crime, it must mean  

234
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.960
that that’s something any of them could be capable 
of. This is something used against more than just  

235
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:05.120
queer people — also immigrant populations 
and… people who generally aren’t white.

236
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.080
Politicians, even liberals, are prone to using 
language that influences voters to believe that  

237
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.120
criminality is inherent in minority 
communities. That if, say, the nation  

238
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.800
lets in refugees from South America they 
will, quote: “bring their crimes with them.”

239
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.840
Because the crimes were always with these people 
– these crimes are an element of their culture  

240
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.640
that they are bringing into America 
where they will spread it among the good,  

241
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.360
heterosexual, cisgender, god-fearing white folk.

242
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.800
And because politics is all about ignoring nuance 
for the sake of cashing in on cheap thrills,  

243
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.240
there are some factors of the human element that 
are deliberately being exempt from the discussion.

244
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.920
First: human beings, on a fundamental, 
physiological, instinctual level are driven  

245
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.880
to survive. More than that, we are driven to 
assure the survival of those in our selected  

246
00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:01.040
family. Chosen or not. We will do almost 
anything it takes to facilitate this survival.

247
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.640
It’s… literally our biology. There is no 
point in debating this. There’s no point  

248
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.440
in arguing with this. Survival, either of the 
self or the group, is our number one objective.  

249
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.320
And trying to deny this, or say that there 
should be ‘limits’ to what we do to survive,  

250
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.600
while might be justified as ‘logical’, is simply 
not taking into account the human reality.  

251
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.320
In order to survive, humans will break social 
conventions (some of which being laws).

252
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.120
Second: …we exist in a network 
of social structures that we call  

253
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.600
‘society.’ Many of these social structures 
(and you can debate this all you want but it  

254
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.000
won’t make it less true) serve to hold 
some people up at the expense of others.  

255
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.160
We’re naturally competitive. Many of us find 
a reward in being better than others somehow,  

256
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.840
and some of us prefer more quantifiable ways: 
those who have more and those who have less.

257
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.960
There cannot be the strong without the weak,  

258
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.320
and some people have a dysfunctional 
obsession with strength.

259
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.600
And factor in a dark ages hard 
social reset followed by imperialism,  

260
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.200
eurocentrism, colonialism, post-colonialism,  

261
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.720
orientalism, a network of slavery over three 
continents, and two world wars… and you’ve  

262
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.280
got a socially permissable means to visually 
profile people and sort them into social classes.

263
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.200
These principles are so deeply internalised in our 
social, economic, political, and legal framework  

264
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.360
that we can’t even be completely aware 
of where the separation is between all of  

265
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.480
that and what is truly human.

266
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.840
As a result, there are some groups of people 
who are locked into such an old-standing system  

267
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.960
of prejudices that they literally cannot 
escape poverty. Being in these situations  

268
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:49.760
of poverty lead to a heightened sense of the 
need to survive. Which leads to a much looser  

269
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.080
attitude around — not necessarily moral codes — 
but removing the community’s moral code from the  

270
00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.800
stringent guidelines of laws that are designed to 
protect the fundamental hierarchy of privilege.

271
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.920
You can’t really say that areas with 
high crime rates have ‘loose morals’  

272
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.880
when there are often strict no-snitching 
social rules in that same neighbourhood,  

273
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.000
and families helping each other out when times 
are tough. This is a very clear indication,  

274
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.160
to me, that human beings inherently want 
morality. We want cooperation, we want society.

275
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.840
However, some groups of people simply 
have been oppressed to the point  

276
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.440
where the morals needed for their 
own survival are not compatible with  

277
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.880
the morals a given society would 
like to foster among the populace.

278
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.240
Which should be seen as a 
problem with society at large,  

279
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.520
and not a problem that exists within 
scattered impoverished communities.  

280
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.920
Society has a way of disincentivizing conventional 
morality among those who cannot afford it.

281
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.840
And then in turn, society 
has a way of over-policing  

282
00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.960
those same neighbourhoods. And then in turn, 
society has a way of branding these people as  

283
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.000
social outsiders whenever they try to make 
people aware of their economic condition.

284
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.680
So a huge portion of our social structures 
are built around a human need for survival,  

285
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.280
and then making survival inherently more 
difficult for certain groups of people.  

286
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.040
When you realise this, it 
becomes very easy to predict  

287
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.320
which groups of people are more likely to act 
outside of social convention in order to survive.

288
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.400
And even if, in a consequentialist frame of mind,  

289
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.000
they aren’t really to blame 
for their economic situation,  

290
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.480
establishment power will use this to create 
fear-based propaganda in order to spur privileged  

291
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.080
voters to support the existing hegemonistic 
hierarchy. And then use this same line of thinking  

292
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.480
to encourage voters to endorse voter-suppression 
tactics against these marginalised communities.

293
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.840
The less these communities can 
contribute to the political process,  

294
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.440
the less control they have over legal processes, 
the greater jurisdiction law enforcement has in  

295
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.480
oppressing these groups, the greater the existing 
hierarchy can perpetuate it’s agenda. And,  

296
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:12.160
in turn, the less incentivized law enforcement 
is to protect and serve the marginalised groups.

297
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.600
It also doesn’t help that law enforcement — 
to this day — continues to under-investigate  

298
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.240
crimes against queer people 
and communities of color,  

299
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.360
especially including, but not limited to, 
sexual assault, murder, and disappearances.

300
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.960
The ‘red dress’ movement wasn’t just 
to raise awareness about missing and  

301
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.240
murdered first nations women — it 
was calling to attention the fact  

302
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.440
that these crimes are almost never 
investigated in the first place.

303
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.120
Queer communities in particular have a… unique 
relationship with this. Though Banana Fish  

304
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.400
did depict the oppression of multiple minority 
communities, it did little to depict the social  

305
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.440
oppression of the queer community as a whole 
and their relationship with the law. In fact,  

306
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.280
the explicitly referenced queer characters, if 
anything, function as class oppressors which…

307
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.720
This is based on a manga from the 
80s, by all means read into that.

308
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.640
But queer communities function a little 
differently from communities of color.  

309
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.160
In part, because queer communities 
are not homogenous in themselves.  

310
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.200
Within a queer underground of a given city there 
is a melting pot of many different cultures and  

311
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.400
cultural experiences. But for the most part 
Queer communities stand out because while we  

312
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.640
may have been born queer, very few 
of us were born into Queer culture.  

313
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.920
In fact, there are many different ways one could 
be queer, and even more ways to express that.

314
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.320
And if we’re talking about Queer Communities 
and their relationship with the law…  

315
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.240
what is a queer community?

316
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.040
As queerness, in whatever form it takes, has 
been taboo in most of the Colonial world for  

317
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.040
the better part of the last thousand years, 
there tends to be a lot of homeless queer  

318
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.680
kids. Go figure. I don’t understand how 
the straights are still shooketh by this.

319
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.920
Why do you think people 
are homeless to begin with?

320
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.480
Queerness is never really a threat to anything 
but your family’s upstanding reputation or,  

321
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.880
insofar as the Catholic church preferred 
keeping the undesirable classes  

322
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.920
as uneducated and god-fearing as possible, 
a threat to your family’s ticket to heaven.

323
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.240
And suddenly you have a religious institution 
built around forgiveness and compassion  

324
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.760
where it is more ethically favourable 
to disown and abandon your children  

325
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.200
than to put up with a quirk 
like who they like kissing.

326
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.560
Within this context, the ‘Queer’ Community, or the 
Gay Community as it was called through the 1900s,  

327
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.240
was a collection of people who had 
either been abandoned by their family,  

328
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.520
pushed out by the communities they grew up in, or 
who had been from accepting families and simply  

329
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.200
rallied together to be among like-minded people. 
That last group was an unfortunately small one,  

330
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.760
and though we’re getting 
better, queer homelessness  

331
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.960
is still the largest subsection of youth 
homelessness in North America and Europe.

332
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.440
This isn’t to say that there wasn’t an 
undertone of sexism and racism in queer circles,  

333
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.160
and which there still is. So… as much as I 
don’t want to frame this with rose-tinted  

334
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.320
glasses… in theory the Queer community 
was a place for a bunch of misfit people  

335
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.480
who didn’t belong anywhere else, because almost 
everywhere else rejected queerness in all forms.

336
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.200
However, persecution against queer people 
was especially harsh because there was a  

337
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.400
widespread public belief that queer people 
actively chose to be the way they were.  

338
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.160
And many within the queer community 
came from communities that were already  

339
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.680
impoverished and persecuted. So when outlining 
a queer relationship with the law, we have to  

340
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:40.320
understand that these were people who stared 
down the barrel of survival nearly every day.

341
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.000
Some of us… even vogued for the 
gunmen and commanded respect.

342
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.400
Dorian Corey began her career 
as a dancer in the 1960s.  

343
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.800
She had risen to become the house mother 
of the House of Corey by the late 1970s,  

344
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.440
walking the catwalk in underground drag balls 
and appearing in shows all throughout Harlem.  

345
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.160
Aside from her famed performances, Corey 
was known for her elaborate ball gowns,  

346
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.520
which included a 30-by-40-foot feather cape that 
took multiple assistants to carry behind her.

347
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.320
It was that reputation as a seamstress that 
led Corey’s friend and caretaker Lois Taylor  

348
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:21.520
to enter her apartment on West 140th Street in 
October 1993. Corey had died two months before of  

349
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.880
AIDS-related complications and had directed Taylor 
to take the costumes she wanted and sell the rest.  

350
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.240
Once inside, Taylor discovered a drycleaning bag 
containing the partially mummified body of a man  

351
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.360
eventually identified as Robert Worley, 
who had been missing since 1968.

352
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.000
Worley's body was wrapped in plastic wrap 
and Naugahyde and doused in baking soda.  

353
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.680
The case remains a mystery to this day, 
despite the fact that many people believe  

354
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.880
Corey killed Worley in self-defence. Both 
Corey, a drag queen, and Worley, an addict,  

355
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.240
both of which built a distrust 
of authority, especially police.  

356
00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.880
With their deaths, the chance to know their 
complete stories vanished, leaving true-crime  

357
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.360
websites and podcasts of varying quality 
to reassemble the pieces of their lives.

358
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.400
Fans of Pose will recognize this story as 
the inspiration for Elektra Evangelista,  

359
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.680
played by Dominique Jackson, in a two-season 
plot arc. Elektra is working as a BDSM mistress  

360
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.640
when one of her clients dies in 
her room from a drug overdose.  

361
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.400
Elektra, like Dorian, understands that the police 
will not assist a Black transgender sex worker.  

362
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.760
However, unlike in Dorian's story, audiences 
know that Elektra has friends to call.

363
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.480
They use skills learned in making ball gowns to 
assist her in sewing the man into a garment bag  

364
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.240
and packing him in a trunk. When 
Elektra is arrested in season three,  

365
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.240
she uses her one phone call to inform 
her house family that the trunk  

366
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.240
in which the body is hidden must be 
moved before the cops search her house.  

367
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.200
Elektra's one-time daughter and now a house 
mother herself, Blanca (played by MJ Rodriguez),  

368
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.000
offers Elektra unconditional love and support. 
In this storyline, viewers get to see the pain  

369
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.320
in Elektra’s past, as well as the camaraderie and 
joy on which she is able to draw in the present.

370
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.840
Crime is rampant in Pose. Whether its hiding a 
dead body, using drugs, sex work, petty theft,  

371
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.240
or lifting a regal display of opulent fashion from 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in order to win a  

372
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.440
ball’s top prize. The series does not shy away 
from the fact that it’s cast of characters are,  

373
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.960
in the laws eyes at least, criminals. But it also 
makes the point that, in many of these cases,  

374
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.440
what other choice to they have?

375
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.040
Multiple characters on the show, both 
male and female, are sex workers in  

376
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.120
one way or another. Whether out and out 
prostitution or, in one interesting case,  

377
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.120
performing strip shows behind glass 
for men willing to pay for the fantasy.  

378
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.040
Certainly a safer way of going about things than 
waiting on the corner and hoping to pick a John  

379
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.520
who isn’t psychotic, and a 1980’s precursor 
to the cam stars of the new millennium.  

380
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.240
In most cases the show portrays these crimes 
as victimless (lets note that Elektra’s dead  

381
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.200
john overdosed all on his own), except when 
the women being hired become the victims.

382
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.720
The show is clear that, when everyone is 
being safe and everyone is concenting,  

383
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.680
the crime of sex work is a victimless one. 
The biggest stress of the job really stems  

384
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:09.040
from the fact that if things do go south, the 
girls have no recourse. They can’t go to the  

385
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.760
police because they’ll likely be locked 
up long before any man who hurt them is.

386
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.960
Is it their first choice of career? Not likely.

387
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.280
One character, Angel, played by Indya Moore,  

388
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.280
starts out the series as a sex worker but 
eventually transitions into modeling. But  

389
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.600
they’re the only sex worker on the show to 
find herself climing into the upper echelons.  

390
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.480
Showing just how rare it is to fight your way 
out of a life of crime into legitimate success.

391
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.600
Indya Moore themself was once a 
sex worker. They told ES magazine:

392
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.520
“It has really destigmatised sex work, not only 
for people watching the show but for me, too – I  

393
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.840
had internalised so much shame. I felt really 
ashamed of having been a sex worker and, coming  

394
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.960
into this industry, it was something that I feared 
I would be outed for and that it would harm me.”

395
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.680
They started in the field because, as a trans 
non-binary youth who’d grown up in the foster  

396
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.080
system, with no money and no real social safety 
net in America, let alone health coverage,  

397
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.080
they needed to find a way to pay for the hormones 
required to be comfortable in their own body.  

398
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.960
And since decent paying jobs aren't 
exactly plentiful when you’re a queer,  

399
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.960
person of Haitian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican 
descent, they did what they had to do.

400
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.080
That’s how pretty much every character on 
Pose who breaks the law ends up doing so.  

401
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:32.240
Nobody is doing it… Mostly nobody is doing it 
for shits and giggles, and nobody is doing it  

402
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:38.160
specifically to hurt other people. They’re doing 
it out of necessity. They’re doing it to survive.

403
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.040
Pose also highlights other people who break 
the law in similarly desperate circumstances.  

404
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.120
The people fighting back against the Regan’s 
Administration’s ignoring of the AIDS crisis.  

405
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.080
The men and women of ACT UP who 
got arrested and charged over  

406
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.800
and over again while protesting 
the unfairness of the situation.  

407
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.400
That thousands of people across the country 
were being left to die by their own government.

408
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:05.280
Desperation is a seed that, once planted, 
can bloom into crime, and eventually,  

409
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.720
if the system isn’t careful, grow into violence. 
But the system would rather arrest these people,  

410
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.800
slapping the label of criminal on them 
forever instead of trying to help them.

411
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.560
“Go through the proper channels” they’re told.

412
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.200
“Oh you want a treatment for AIDS? Well,  

413
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.920
funding Contras in Nicaragua is far more 
important than funding AIDS research.”

414
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.040
“You want an education that doesn’t leave 
you a hundred thousand dollars in debt?  

415
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.240
Sorry, we have tax breaks we need to pass.”

416
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.080
“You want to not die because you 
can’t afford cancer treatment?  

417
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.480
Sorry, but we’d much prefer to 
fund fighter jets even though  

418
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.400
no countries we’ve gone to war with in the 
last 30 years have a f*cking fighter jet!”

419
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:48.000
And so, when you ask politely, and get slapped 
in the face, what recourse do you have? Breaking  

420
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.640
the law, of course. This is universal, but 
particularly prescient for queer people,  

421
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.720
especially trans people, when the entire 
system is set up to keep you from existing.  

422
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.840
Gender confirmation treatment and surgeries don’t 
come cheap. And even if you’re in a country that  

423
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.160
subsidises them, then they don't come fast. Decade 
long wait lists for gender confirmation surgery  

424
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:15.040
consultations, NOT the surgery. A decade just to 
talk to a doctor about it. Or if you’re in the US,  

425
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.600
you can make it happen a lot faster, but it 
can cost upwards of a hundred thousand dollars.

426
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.840
And it’s very easy to say, well that’s 
a problem for the queers. I’m fine.

427
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.240
Oh, are you?

428
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.800
The Supreme Court is set to rule on abortion 
in 2022, and things aren’t looking good for a  

429
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.520
woman’s right to choose. If abortions are made 
illegal, even in the case of sexual assault,  

430
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.800
you, a victim, may become a criminal as you 
try to take control of your own body again.

431
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.720
Or how about if the housing market goes bust and 
by no fault of your own, thanks to the convoluted  

432
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.600
ways mortgages can change hands in America, 
you’re told by the bank that you underpaid your  

433
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.080
mortgage last month by a few cents, a payment 
increase they neglected to inform you of.

434
00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.440
And so you need to get the hell out of that 
house. But you refuse. Now you’re a criminal.  

435
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.640
Now the cops are going to come to your door and 
force you out of your home. They’re not going  

436
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.360
to arrest the finance experts who screwed you, 
but they might just arrest you if you resist.

437
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.040
But, yet, a lot of people don’t see this. 
They still see the trans sex worker, or the  

438
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.000
desperate gay man pushed to desperate measures, 
or the abused teenager running away from home  

439
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.880
and doing what they need to do to survive… 
they don’t see them like they see themselves.

440
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.800
And so a lot of people, an 
awful lot of people are a-okay  

441
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.240
with there being laws against sex 
work or selling drugs, even weed,  

442
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.520
or working under the table at a bar. An awful 
lot of people think, yeah, put them in jail.  

443
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:49.840
Or fine them, that’s more humane. But then when 
they can’t pay the fine, where do they go? Prison.

444
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.880
What happens? They’re trapped in the system.

445
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.320
When they get out they have a big red CRIMINAL 
stamped on their forehead when they try to get  

446
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.080
a typical job and then… they’re forced back into 
the same situation that got them put in prison  

447
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:11.120
in the first place. Unless they have community to 
help them, to hold them up, to protect them. But  

448
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.840
the gay community isn’t exactly a great place 
to turn to for help these days. Not anymore.

449
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.640
So many queer people with the means to 
help other queer people really don’t care.  

450
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.840
Look at Kristin Sinema, the bisexual 
democratic senator from Arizona who has  

451
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.840
basically made a caree lately of saying 
“screw the poor”. She may be queer,  

452
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.080
but she doesnt fight for the queer community. 
It’s a very… “I got mine” attitude.

453
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.720
Running in tandem with establishment gay men 
and women pressuring eccentricities out of queer  

454
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.160
people, there is an ongoing push to recognize 
the razor’s edge that Queer rights hang on.

455
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.280
A large component of what is referred to as 
Queer Anarchy strives to understand the ways  

456
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.640
in which Queer communities, as they were more or 
less ignored by the political and legal power,  

457
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.960
developed their own systems of 
self-governance. These communal structures  

458
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.120
were what led to the mass-mobilization 
of queer and queer-supporting groups  

459
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.040
in urban centres leading to a relatively 
quick turnaround in terms of rights being won.

460
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.120
Now, you may hear the word ‘anarchy’ and be 
frightened in a Satanic Panic kind of way.  

461
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.360
And… this is in no small part due to the way that 
privileged white people either use Anarchy as an  

462
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:29.520
aesthetic, or assume that Anarchy is a matter of 
founding a libertarian Mad Max, governmentless,  

463
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.280
wild west. However, Anarchy has many 
different branches and sub-schools of thought.

464
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.040
Generally speaking… Anarchists reject 
prevailing political ideologies and  

465
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:46.640
processes as being inherent or true. This 
may mean they want governmental reform,  

466
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.520
or that they want to replace 
existing governments with new ones.  

467
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.680
It may also mean that they want to be able to live 
separately from federal or municipal oversight.

468
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.720
It’s where cryptocurrency comes from.

469
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.560
Like I said, this is a complicated movement, 
and the media really does latch on to those  

470
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.600
white kids from middle-income suburbs who 
decide that rules are for fools in school… yo…

471
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.200
Subsequently, the same group 
that drops out of college and  

472
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.680
then become zombie apocalypse survivalists.

473
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.040
Queer Anarchism, actually, has a long history 
predating many American queer communities as  

474
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.960
we know them. Anarchist movements within these 
circles analyse the ways in which the law itself  

475
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.080
is designed for selective oppression. 
How can a government which systematically  

476
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.520
rejects certain citizens for a reason that is 
entirely benign, call itself a civil society?

477
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.760
Evidently, they argue,  

478
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.160
there must be an underlying institution which 
benefits from certain people being oppressed,  

479
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:46.320
exploiting a government system which is designed 
to protect the interests of upper classes and…

480
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.320
Yeah the answer… is… usually capitalism.

481
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.200
If people are poor. People are desperate.

482
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.440
And if people are desperate, 
then they are pliable.

483
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.120
And if people are pliable, and preferably 
under-educated, then they completely believe  

484
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.680
that you can’t raise the minimum wage 
or else Elon Musk, speaking of crypto,  

485
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.200
who worked hard for every one of his billions 
of dollars, will personally… go homeless.

486
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.640
There it is folks. The multi-billionaires 
are the real persecuted class of society.

487
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.880
Now, once again, I’m generalizing, but there is 
a recognition that Queer acceptance comes with  

488
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.720
a cost — or essencially assimilate into 
hetero-hegimonistic social structures,  

489
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.000
or to express one’s queerness in a way that 
the hetero-hegimony is comfortable with. We are  

490
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.960
badgered out of our queerness because cis-hetero 
power structures hold our rights hostage.

491
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.400
And then when we exist in 
poverty and homelessness,  

492
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.120
they remind us that we only 
have ourselves to blame.

493
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.880
Somehow, in this situation, we 
are the ones who are illegal.

494
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.840
In the process of critically examining 
our society’s laws and legal protections,  

495
00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:03.040
Queer Anarchy conforms to the idea of ‘be 
gay, do crime’ as a rallying call. This being,  

496
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.000
that our worth and value is not 
linked to our ability to adhere  

497
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.360
to a legal system that is in no way meant 
to benefit us. And that this same system,  

498
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.720
being ‘the law’ in a philosophical context, 
exists to use force if necessary to convince us  

499
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.120
that we should conform to social conventions 
in order to benefit those who exploit us.

500
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.640
Doing crime in this case is not 
necessarily murdering someone,  

501
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.080
but rejecting a socially held convention 
because a law says it. Instead, critically  

502
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.320
think about who benefits from this 
law? Who is this law meant to protect?  

503
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.200
Who is this law meant to target? And most 
importantly, even if a law does exist,  

504
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.840
such as laws against sexual assault, does the 
legal process consistantly acknowledge it?

505
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.400
Is the process likely to side 
with the victim? Or the accused?

506
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.200
And then critically deconstruct why that is.

507
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:58.240
Once again… the answer is usually capitalism. 
Not necessarily purist capitalism — as per an  

508
00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.960
adapting marketplace of ideas that rewards 
merit — but crony capitalism… Which may just  

509
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.640
be a natural inevitability of capitalism. In 
an economic system which prioritises wealth,  

510
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.720
the law simply becomes a method to protect 
those who have the means to afford it.

511
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.760
Pride around Queerness in this context is that 
your inherent existence stands in opposition to  

512
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.840
these institutions of persecution. 
If identity itself is the crime,  

513
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.240
then we need to re-examine the definition 
of what a crime is. And to do that,  

514
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.080
we need to strip away the illusion 
that laws exist to protect everyone.

515
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.880
Within American continental policing, 
there is a bias among officers to favour  

516
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.200
wealthy districts — because as they 
are paid by the state tax dollars,  

517
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.640
they see these people as being more responsible 
for their salaries. Whereas poorer districts  

518
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.760
are not seen as if they are worth the time. 
Because property taxes are so much lower there.

519
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.520
So we have several groups of 
people who struggle to survive,  

520
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.160
who have no significant voice in legal processes, 
and who are not protected by law enforcement.  

521
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:15.040
What right do we as a society have to blame people 
for developing a set of guiding moral principles  

522
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.760
that do not align with prevailing laws, insofar as 
laws are designed to protect financial interest.

523
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.200
As I mentioned about police being aware of where 
their salaries come from, and thus feel a greater  

524
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.560
sense of obligation to higher-income districts, 
can we really say that public law enforcement is  

525
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.640
any different than a bunch of dark-age Lords 
hiring mercenaries to protect their castles?  

526
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.720
Understanding that people do 
want to exist cooperatively,  

527
00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.720
what function does law enforcement 
have in a realistic way?

528
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:49.520
Many of the legal processes we have are inherited 
from ancient societies. The very laws we consider  

529
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.720
are ones to protect people are laws that 
were developed within feudalism. The wealthy  

530
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.840
protected themselves, and serfs, peasants, 
servants, and slaves were just collateral.

531
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.000
Dating back to ancient Persia, 
Egypt, Greece, India, and China,  

532
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.600
there was a much greater openness to admit that 
society was built on a structure of hierarchy.  

533
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.240
Oftentimes the rules that divided who was above 
who on a social ladder were clearly outlined and  

534
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.920
written in stone. And there was pride in this. 
Pride in being social betters among the elites,  

535
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.600
and a sense of conforming oneself to 
one’s purpose among the lower classes.

536
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.360
Though even with the divine right 
of kings and a religious population,  

537
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:35.760
the threat of rebellion was a very real, very 
constant threat. The wealthy of society danced  

538
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.040
a razors edge of amassing their wealth, 
while making public displays of generosity.  

539
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:46.800
Monuments, gardens, public libraries, schools, 
and even negotiated time off work, festivals,  

540
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.960
feasts — orgies! — all to give a little back 
to the public they were leaching wealth out of.

541
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.600
Those higher on the ladder had the finances 
to afford security to protect their assets.  

542
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.240
Their land, their possessions, their business 
interests. And just as much, they were protecting  

543
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:07.280
themselves from rivals, they also wanted to 
protect themselves from ‘social inferiors.’  

544
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:13.120
The wealthy had the ear of politicians who 
could then pass into legislation a system  

545
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.200
of laws that would institutionally 
protect the wealthy from the poor.

546
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.440
For instance, laws prohibiting theft really 
accomplish nothing to protect the poor.

547
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.560
For most of human history, the concept of ‘owning’  

548
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.520
‘property’ was something entirely foreign 
to MOST people. Everything a serf had was  

549
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:34.080
provided to them by a Lord. And owning land was 
something that only those with money could do.  

550
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.480
Anti-theft laws really only protect those who 
had something worth stealing in the first place.

551
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.960
And in many other ways, laws which 
essentially target poor people for  

552
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.760
being in desperate situations. A crime for 
which the punishment is a fine essentially  

553
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.560
means it’s legal as long as you 
have the money to sign a cheque.  

554
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.280
Because $500 is going to hit a $15,000/year 
household in a way so profoundly disruptive,  

555
00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:05.200
but is almost entirely unnoticeable to someone 
whose net-worth is measured in stocks and bonds.

556
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.080
A legal system that is invested in 
pursuing the more peaceful means  

557
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.960
of coexistence among it’s people would 
aim to ensure a distribution of privilege.  

558
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.160
Rather than focusing on protecting those 
who have enough of a horde to protect.

559
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.920
There’s that dragon again.

560
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.680
That there are no laws against 
withholding wealth from the poor  

561
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.880
is abundantly telling. In fact, something 
like wage theft is perfectly legal.

562
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:37.760
All of this feeds into why under-privilaged 
communities would opt-out of typical legal  

563
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:43.920
structures in favour of their own communal systems 
of accountability. And in this kind of dynamic:  

564
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.480
survival, existence — let alone comfort — 
are functionally criminal actions. Because  

565
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.800
in order to survive, one must exist outside 
the law that is forcing them either to conform,  

566
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.280
or be silent in their suffering.

567
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:05.200
But make no mistake — our prevailing elite do not 
want the under-privilaged to simply not exist or  

568
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:12.480
go away. Without an underclass, the upper-class of 
society would have, primarily, no basis of wealth  

569
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:18.960
comparison, and secondarily, no means to exploit a 
scarcity of class mobility to extort cheap labour.

570
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.080
The mantra of hard work equating to financial 
success automatically feeds into this power  

571
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:30.080
dynamic. Without this mindset, there would be 
no way to continue to cast the illusion that  

572
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:35.600
within America, and much of the modern world, 
there exists a freedom of class mobility.

573
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.160
When, in fact, fluid class 
mobility is the absolute last thing  

574
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.040
an oligarchic power structure wants

575
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.800
Nobody’s saying that we should go out and 
be criminals. To live lawlessly, selfishly.  

576
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:55.280
As remarked by Oscar Wilde in the Portrait 
of Dorian Grey, vice is a slide. When you  

577
00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.560
start with just a little, it’s easy to 
escalate into some complete debauchery.  

578
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.400
When we begin to discard social convention, 
there’s no clear guideline as to when to stop.

579
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.280
Like Walter White in Breaking Bad, cooking 
meth in order to pay for cancer treatment…  

580
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:18.800
To keep his family safe and out of danger. Until 
he, himself, became the danger. There’s a point  

581
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.360
where you can say that you survived. But… your 
survival came at the cost of breaking the law.

582
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.400
Why not go all out and keep it rolling? 
The punishment’s not gonna get worse.

583
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:35.920
One crime begets another crime to justify it. 
Where do we draw the line? When does the need for  

584
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:41.520
survival become the need for comfort? When does 
the need for comfort become the need for excess?

585
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:47.040
And unlike those who have money 
before they start committing crimes,  

586
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.040
we at the bottom don’t have the ability to 
buy a couple of Senators in order to make  

587
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:56.400
amendments to the law, making what was once 
a crime legal… for the right kind of people.

588
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.280
Even the legalisation of marijuana is really 
only legalising production for a certain few,  

589
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.040
and keeping production illegal for the people 
who have been cultivating it for decades.

590
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:16.480
More and more laws are added to our culture, 
prohibiting the actions of the poor.  

591
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.160
And at the same time we remove laws which 
prohibit the actions of those rich enough  

592
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.320
to pay for the right accountants, 
exploit the right loopholes,  

593
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.360
diversify their investments, shift their money 
between so many international bank accounts that  

594
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.640
it’s difficult for external investigators to tally 
up how much money they have. How much they owe.

595
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.280
Which leads to situations where companies 
like Apple are able to file their taxes in  

596
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.520
ways that make it seem like they lost money. 
Which then makes this company which, at times,  

597
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.200
has had more liquid assets than the American 
Federal Government, qualified for tax refunds.

598
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.880
You, with your 30K salary… you can’t do that.  

599
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.760
You don’t have the money needed to pay 
the cost to hide it, to exploit it.

600
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.320
And while there are degrees of wealth that 
are, for whatever reason, impossible to tax…  

601
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.200
at the same time, there’s no amount too 
low that the government won’t want a cut.  

602
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:23.360
Sales tax exists to tax those who make too 
little to have to pay income or property taxes.

603
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:28.080
We live in a world where the Gateses, 
the Besoses, the Musks, the Bloomburgs  

604
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:33.600
all brag about how much money they have in 
interviews, and yet these same people turn  

605
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.720
around and cry to the government about how they 
don’t have enough money to be worth taxing.

606
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.440
And nobody in the Government – at least very 
few people — seem to see any problem with that.

607
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:55.040
Both Pose and Bananna Fish bombard viewers with 
this messaging. Breaking Bad too. To have power  

608
00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.880
is the ability to exercise authority over 
others. And authority is the ability to decide  

609
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.920
what the law is and, by extension, influence 
others’ understanding of right and wrong.

610
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.480
And those in positions of authority use it.

611
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.120
Why do you think people want 
these positions in politics,  

612
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:21.600
want these massive hordes of wealth, want these 
authoritative roles in law enforcement — do you  

613
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.120
think they seek out this kind of power just to 
say they have it? Or are they going to use it?

614
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:34.480
Those with authority make their criminal actions 
legal. And when they’re legal, they’re not wrong.  

615
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:41.120
And if it’s not wrong, it’s right. And if 
it’s right, you’re going to do it some more.

616
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:48.560
Banana Fish shows two kinds of criminals – those 
on the streets, and those in Mansions. Those in  

617
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.400
mansons can decide what the law is, they can 
decide what a criminal is. And they decide  

618
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.080
that those on the street hustling a couple 
thousand dollars to pay their way through the  

619
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:06.080
next few months are scum. They’re worse than scum, 
they’re a threat to the very fabric of society.

620
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.600
Meanwhile these same people syphon money out 
of the economy to add to their heap of gold.  

621
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.760
They amass amounts of wealth they never intend 
to spend. Money that will sit in a bank account,  

622
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.880
accruing interest, that will forever be removed 
from the economy. It will never pay an employee,  

623
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.840
it will never buy a product, will never 
pay for a service. It’s gone. Forever.

624
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:34.960
And so other people will get poorer. The 
upper-middle class will become the middle class.  

625
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:40.320
And the middle class will become poor. 
And the poor will become destitute. When  

626
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.600
it comes to trickle-down economics there 
is only one thing that moves downward.

627
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.240
Desperation.

628
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.040
And the more people are desperate, the more 
the rich can continue to manipulate laws,  

629
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.160
can scapegoat poor people 
problems on other poor people,  

630
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.200
defund public services. The more they can 
buy, the more they control, the more angles  

631
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.280
they have to attack you and convince you 
that it’s your fault that you’re poor.

632
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.520
Because, they say, the rich worked hard for 
their money. For their wealth. For their  

633
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.760
horde. The dragon sits atop the heap of gold 
coins it did not mint, that it did not mine,  

634
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:27.040
jewels it did not cut and crowns it did not 
smelt. The dragon just had the power to take it,  

635
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.360
and the power to convince everyone 
else that it was invulnerable.

636
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:37.680
The great lie of mythology is that we were 
convinced that we had to fight the dragon  

637
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.680
one at a time. That, while the dragon flexes 
its power, there’s a code of honour — a law,  

638
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.720
if you will — that said we have to face it 
in a duel or else our victory wouldn’t count.  

639
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.280
We needed one brave knight to do the 
fighting for us all. Instead of we,  

640
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.720
all of us, crashing into the dragon’s 
den and wrecking the son of a bitch.

641
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.280
But at some point the laws of 
chivalry became the laws of the land.  

642
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:07.040
Passed down by the men who ruled the world. The 
kings and governors and presidents and, now,  

643
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
the guys who took advantage of a pandemic to 
become even richer than they already were.  

644
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.640
The ones who argued that patents 
on vaccines should remain intact.  

645
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.000
The ones that fooled people into believing that 
pretend, online monopoly money was the future.

646
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.440
That’s why I loved Banana Fish. Though the 
plot is messy and overly complicated, and Ash  

647
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.840
is a bit of a Mary Sue, and his relationship 
with Eiji isn’t quite as obvious as I’d like.  

648
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.000
I loved the show because of what 
it said about the world we live in.

649
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:43.520
The evil, powerful men in the highest echelons 
of organised crime and government are,  

650
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:52.160
in the end, taken down because the low classes, 
the downtrodden, the abused, the traumatised,  

651
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.800
the minorities… they worked together to bring down 
the power players that were keeping them down.  

652
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:02.480
The street kids tore down an empire of 
abuse and took some power for themselves.

653
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:10.480
The series showed that it's possible to overcome 
the dragon if you work together. And so maybe,  

654
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.800
if Ash really did die, it’s fitting. It’s fitting 
that the perfect knight in shining armour,  

655
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.400
who led the charge to take down the 
dragon, didn’t survive to see the  

656
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:26.800
days to come. Because the world he’d grown 
up in, that empire of abuse, had fallen.

657
00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.280
There was no place left for him in 
the new world that stood around him,  

658
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.920
and so he passed on from it. Maybe onto a new 
life. Maybe he got up from that table in the New  

659
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:44.240
York Public Library, got stitched up, and flew 
to Japan, where he could live a different life.  

660
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.960
One where he didn’t have to be a 
knight fighting dragons anymore.

661
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:56.080
There are real people like Ash in this world, 
fighting to change things, to take down the  

662
00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:02.960
dragons controlling us all. Abusing us. 
Traumatising us. And it usually is the  

663
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.680
ones who are most abused and traumatised, the 
most desperate, that will fight the hardest.

664
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.760
People dying of AIDS, fighting a system set 
up to ignore them. People born into the wrong  

665
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.240
body fighting to be acknowledged for who they 
really are. The sick fighting for healthcare.  

666
00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.520
The poor fighting for opportunities. And when the 
system decides these battles are too inconvenient,  

667
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:31.120
simply fighting them becomes illegal. 
And then those knights become criminals.

668
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.720
So maybe becoming a criminal 
is necessary sometimes.  

669
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:43.840
And if the law does not reflect what 
we need, maybe it’s even essential.

670
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:53.840
So be gay. Do crime. And have 
a good time while you do it.
