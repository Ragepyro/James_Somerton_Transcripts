00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.760
it's january 22nd 2001
and 12 year old me is laying in bed

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.199
unable to sleep
flicking through the channels on my tv

6
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.880
ceaselessly
when i come across this

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.160
as you can imagine it immediately caught
my eye

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.399
especially considering what happens
right after this which i can't show you

9
00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360
on youtube
and what caught my eye

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.600
turned into an avid attachment to a
certain group of queer characters living

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.879
in pittsburgh pennsylvania
first and most noticeable there's brian

12
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.800
the vain sexually promiscuous
advertising executive who hides a

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.520
generous spirit behind a self-obsessed
and even cruel personality

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.760
justin a bright-eyed high schooler who's
fallen in love with brian but didn't

15
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
quite realize that though brian was his
first

16
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.320
justin was nothing more than a hookup to
him

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.439
at least at first michael brian's best
friend still suffering from a teenage

18
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.520
crush that never went away stuck in a
dead-end job where he has to pretend to

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.159
be straight around his homophobic
co-workers

20
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.479
emmett michael's flamboyant roommate who
comes across as your typical vapid

21
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.040
flaming queen but becomes probably the
best character on the show

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.759
ted a loveless accountant who thinks
he's completely undesirable and envies

23
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.479
brian's ability to get any man that he
wants

24
00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.600
lindsay brian's college girlfriend who's
now a lesbian or maybe bisexual

25
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.200
in the very first episode she gave birth
to a baby for which brian was the

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.560
surrogate and thereafter she basically
acts as brian's conscience on more than

27
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
one occasion melanie lindsay's hard-ass
jewish lawyer life partner who hates

28
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.399
brian with a burning passion
and last but certainly not least

29
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.719
debbie michael's loving mother who
covers herself with p flag pins and acts

30
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.479
as a sort of den mother to the guys who
eat at the diner she works at

31
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
where she busts her butt doing double
shifts to make the money she needs to

32
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.920
take care of her brother vic who's dying
of aids

33
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.160
the first three episodes were all aired
at once as a premiere episode in canada

34
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.080
whereas the show had already been out
for about a month in the u.s so i wasn't

35
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.640
sure if i was watching a new tv show i'd
never heard of or a movie

36
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.560
i was hoping for a tv show
so on that night in january of 2001

37
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.800
i spent three hours getting to know at
least a little bit about each one of

38
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.480
these characters
luckily the three episodes ended on a

39
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.680
cliffhanger so i knew i'd be back the
next week volume down low glued to my tv

40
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.800
screen
having never seen any kind of gay media

41
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.800
before except will and grace i was
astounded at the bluntness of the show's

42
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.760
portrayal of sex drugs homophobia being
in the closet dealing with disease and

43
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.640
friendship
specifically adult friendship between

44
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.280
queer people the show aired for five
seasons with its final episode airing in

45
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.760
august of 2005
and for those five years i grew up with

46
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.319
the show
i laughed i cried i raged and i cheered

47
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.280
i even got my mom to watch it and so it
shocks me now in 2022

48
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.879
that most of the queer people i talk to
have either never seen or never even

49
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.360
heard of this show that was a ratings
juggernaut for showtime

50
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.239
and which the new york times declared
was

51
00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.040
genuinely revolutionary
so let's have a look back two decades

52
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.440
and see why we queer folk
don't tend to talk

53
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.519
about queer as folk
[Music]

54
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.840
queer's folk was based on a british tv
show of the same name created by russell

55
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.599
t davies when the original uk series of
queers folk premiered in 1999 it caused

56
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.760
outrage over scenes depicting gay sex
extensive drug use artificial

57
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.040
insemination and more sex scenes than
you can count

58
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.120
set in manchester's lively gay scene the
series chronicled the lives of three gay

59
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.320
men living in and around canal street
the show was sexually graphic and

60
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.680
unapologetically gay the series pushed
the envelope of what could be shown on

61
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.280
television
the show's slogan even read

62
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.199
no victims no murders no role models
the show was criticized from all fronts

63
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.600
religious leaders demanded it be removed
from television conservatives boycotted

64
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.160
the network and gay viewers claimed it
did nothing but perpetuate the harmful

65
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.199
stereotype of the promiscuous gay man
all that said the ratings were through

66
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.160
the roof
watching people be naughty has always

67
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.720
been a popular genre of tv from 80s
soaps like dallas and dynasty to dramas

68
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.400
like shameless and reality tv shows like
the real housewives

69
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.759
it was like watching a tabloid magazine
come to life in the comfort of your

70
00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.000
living room
and nothing succeeds like success

71
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so it was no surprise when north
american producers daniel lippman roy

72
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.039
cohen and tony jonas wanted to adapt the
series for the u.s market

73
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.160
they had a hell of a time trying to
convince a u.s network to pick it up

74
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.639
though even hbo which had just seen a
massive success with sexually explicit

75
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.440
shows like oz and sex in the city turned
them down they were convinced a show all

76
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.199
about queer characters wouldn't sell in
america showcase a canadian network was

77
00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.560
actually the first to come on board and
agree to co-produce the series before

78
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.320
they finally struck a deal with showtime
in the united states for an initial

79
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.840
22-episode season
this meant the show would be a

80
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.360
canadian-american co-production with
most of the shooting happening in

81
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.000
ontario with toronto standing in for
pittsburgh the producers wanted to make

82
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.039
a show for queer people so they did
their best in hiring out-gay actors

83
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.479
but since coming out at the time was
pretty much a guaranteed career death

84
00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.280
for an actor the show did end up being
made up of a majority straight cast

85
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.600
when the show premiered it immediately
grabbed the attention of the gay press

86
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.680
but that was it
only a few short years prior ellen had

87
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.039
been drummed out of hollywood for coming
out on her own sitcom

88
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.720
and even though will and grace portrayed
as sanitized a gay experience as

89
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.400
possible the nbc show's ratings were yet
to take off the mainstream press simply

90
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.759
wasn't interested in covering this gay
show with a word that was at the time

91
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.400
still considered a slur in the title
audiences felt differently though

92
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.840
the ratings for the premiere were strong
and they just kept getting better every

93
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.600
week when the show made its premiere in
canada a month later it became the

94
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.560
highest rated premiere in canadian
history

95
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.440
for a show not on the cbc the press
started paying attention

96
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.800
and just like in england some people
were not happy

97
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.680
a boycott of cbs was called for cbs
being the parent network to showtime

98
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.960
and death threats were made against the
stars and producers

99
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.639
and that was just the reaction coming
from the gay audience yes history was

100
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.639
repeating itself as the gay community
felt disgusted by the show's portrayal

101
00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.880
of gay men as sexually liberated they
hated the casual drug use and felt

102
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.120
offended by the main storyline in which
17 year old justin has sex with and

103
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.240
subsequently falls in love with 29 year
old brian and they loathed that much of

104
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.199
the show took place surrounded by the
thumpathumpa beats of the gay nightclub

105
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.919
babylon conservative groups also called
for boycotts sent death threats and

106
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.199
demanded the show's cancellation
also on moral grounds because

107
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.960
you know what they say about war making
for strange bedfellows but not because

108
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.840
the show's queer characters were not
perfect but because they existed at all

109
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.319
i thought i'd die fighting sight by
sanchez a bigot mary you were arguing on

110
00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:52.000
the same side as a bigot naturally
showtime and especially their parent

111
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.919
company viacom were worried
there was a threat that they might drop

112
00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.759
the show to which canadian production
company temple street productions

113
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.599
offered to buy them out and make the
show a wholly canadian produced project

114
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:07.840
but when the ratings just kept going up
and up and up

115
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.960
showtime's fears were assuaged the show
was garnering far better ratings than

116
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.280
well quite frankly better than anyone
had ever expected especially since a

117
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.319
vocal part of the queer community had
sworn off watching the show the

118
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:24.639
demographic that was expected to be the
primary audience what the network

119
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.599
eventually discovered was that the
majority of the viewers were actually

120
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:31.599
straight women who were living for this
type of high drama you didn't really get

121
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:36.560
on tv anymore queer as folk was
unapologetically soapy a genre for which

122
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.440
fans had recently been left starving for
with the end of shows like melrose place

123
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.839
and beverly hills 90210 it would take a
few years before network tv would start

124
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.519
premiering shows like desperate
housewives so this show about gay men

125
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:53.839
and women in pennsylvania was becoming
their main source of entertainment and

126
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:58.160
since women between the ages of 18 and
45 are considered a marketing wet dream

127
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.760
it allowed queers folk to start charging
more for advertising during the

128
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.440
commercial breaks by the end of the
first season they were one of the most

129
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.720
talked about shows on cable the boycott
never really seemed to materialize the

130
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.800
show hadn't been renewed for a second
season yet though so they used a tried

131
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.040
and tested tool that had been used by
soap operas since the beginning of time

132
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.279
a cliffhanger ending that is dripping
with so much suspense that audiences

133
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.920
would do just about anything
to know how it would be resolved

134
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.200
[Music]
justin goes to his prom with best friend

135
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.080
daphne after begging brian to be his
date though brian being brian turns him

136
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.240
down he's having a fun enough time but
when brian does show up

137
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.560
it's simply fireworks
they dance to the song save the last

138
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.440
dance for me by the drifters
it is as brian later quips

139
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.920
ridiculously romantic after where justin
walks brian back to his jeep before

140
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.279
heading back to his prom to spend the
rest of the night with daphne he's

141
00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:03.839
practically floating as he walks away
until chris hobbs a bully who's been

142
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:08.079
torturing him all season
appears behind him with a pipe and hits

143
00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:12.800
him across the head with justin a bloody
mess being rushed to the hospital the

144
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.120
season ends the audience does not know
if he's alive

145
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.360
or dead
demand for a second season was loud

146
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.040
swift and decisive
with showtime renewing it for another 20

147
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.720
episodes within the first week after the
season finale in the second season

148
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.040
justin is of course alive though
suffering from brain damage he'd hoped

149
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.640
to be an artist but a tremor in his hand
resulting from the attack seems to have

150
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.720
put that dream to bed but with the help
of a drawing tablet a pretty expensive

151
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.959
gift at the time from brian
justin can keep drawing defying the will

152
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:49.600
of his attacker speaking of his attacker
he's let off with a slap on the wrist

153
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.160
and some community service
sometimes things never change

154
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.880
season two continued to push the
boundaries of what had been seen on

155
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.240
american television before with michael
becoming involved in a romantic

156
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.800
relationship with ben an hiv-positive
university professor unlike the first

157
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.720
season where gay media lambasted the
show they were now willing to praise it

158
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.399
for its portrayal of living with an
hiv-positive partner and surviving

159
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.880
trauma because gays will validate
themselves only if tragic they weren't

160
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.920
thrilled with the character of ted
starting up a porn studio and emmett

161
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.000
becoming a cam star but they kept their
mouths mostly shut regarding those

162
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.360
storylines it's harder to threaten to
boycott a show that's bringing queer

163
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.360
issues into millions of homes each week
the show even poked fun at its own gay

164
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.959
critics with the in-universe tv show gay
as blazes

165
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:39.760
with its cast of hrc approved gay
characters that brian loads the second

166
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.360
season also dealt with topics like gay
marriage with a commitment ceremony

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.720
between melanie and lindsay
intergenerational love when emmett falls

168
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.880
in love with a much older man
polyamorous relationships and a gay

169
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.720
murder victim based on the real life
case of billy london whose body was

170
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.120
found in a dumpster outside a diner with
ratings doing better than ever the show

171
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.800
was renewed for a third season halfway
through season two's run but because of

172
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.399
the canadian dollar rising in value and
therefore production becoming more

173
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:10.639
expensive the episode run was cut from
20 to 14 for the third and fourth

174
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:14.079
seasons
and 13 for the final season season 3

175
00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:17.680
broadens its narrative scope as michael
and justin begin publishing an explicit

176
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.720
gay superhero comic as brian becomes the
pr manager for a homophobic politician

177
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.560
who used to be a cop
as ted loses his porn company when it's

178
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.720
discovered that one of his employees a
production assistant was underage much

179
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.120
to his shock and horror and michael and
ben adopt a homeless teenage sex worker

180
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.000
and help him get back to a normal life
season 4 goes darker than any before it

181
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.480
exploring ted's descent into drug abuse
and recovery justin joining a vigilante

182
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.720
group that violently attacks homophobes
giving justin the opportunity to finally

183
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.880
confront his would-be killer brian being
diagnosed with cancer and debbie's

184
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.120
beloved brother vic passing away due to
complications from aids

185
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.120
season four also deals heavily with the
current political state of the u.s

186
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.399
referencing the real life event of
president george w bush calling for a

187
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:08.480
constitutional amendment to ban gay
marriage the season ends with most of

188
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.320
the main cast going to canada for a
charity bike ride and having to reckon

189
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.839
with how they're treated in their home
country compared to the great white

190
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:20.639
north season 4 also saw the show's run
time extended from 1 hour to 1 hour and

191
00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.839
15 minutes
not because an extra 15 minutes of story

192
00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:27.680
was added but because advertising spots
on the show were in such high demand

193
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.920
that they could add extra commercials to
each broadcast great for the show but

194
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.839
not so great for me a then high school
student who's already staying up well

195
00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:39.920
past midnight to watch the show
season 5 explored dating a closeted

196
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.760
person the domestication of queer
couples as michael and ben buy a house

197
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.440
in the suburbs and move away from the
gay village with its sex clubs and gay

198
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.639
bars growing up as they call it while
brian fights against gentrification

199
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.519
which
i think it can be a little condescending

200
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:59.680
to ascribe your chosen lifestyle as
grown up and implying that others need

201
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.199
to grow up just because they want
something different all while a

202
00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:07.839
statewide bill proposition 14 threatens
to remove what few rights the gay

203
00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:11.920
community has managed to accumulate the
final act of the series begins as a

204
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.760
fundraiser is bombed
leaving many of the main cast in mortal

205
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.519
danger
in the final episode aptly titled we

206
00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.800
will survive
melanie and lindsey move to canada in

207
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.720
order to attempt to escape the growing
homophobia of their home country

208
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.560
michael who has always been a bit shy of
even talking about being gay begins

209
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.399
actively fighting for gay rights
and the on-again off-again relationship

210
00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.920
between brian and justin which could be
described as the emotional through line

211
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.600
of the series
firmly switches to off

212
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.639
the show ended its run after 83 episodes
not because of bad ratings but because

213
00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:50.160
showtime didn't want to be known as the
gay network

214
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.839
since they were also airing the l word
at the same time the network would

215
00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:57.440
eventually say that the cancellation was
due to rising production costs as the

216
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.720
canadian dollar increased ever more in
value but the cast vehemently disagreed

217
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.360
showcase was willing to produce a season
six to air in canada since they were

218
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.279
making so much money from advertising on
the show but due to ownership rights at

219
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:15.279
the time showtime wouldn't allow it
and so

220
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:20.480
queer as folk hailed as groundbreaking
dynamic-shifting must-see tv

221
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.560
came to an end
not with a bang but a whimper

222
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.480
as the show's straight audience moved
back to network tv which had picked up

223
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.759
the torch for soapy primetime dramas and
its gay audience to my surprise

224
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:37.759
was glad to see it go although the gay
criticisms of the show had died down

225
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:41.120
over the years especially after it
became a rating success

226
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.880
ire toward the series from gay groups
looking to assimilate into the straight

227
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.399
culture
never ceased they argued that since the

228
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:51.759
show was made up of almost entirely
queer characters

229
00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:55.360
that it was ghettoizing lgbt
representation

230
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.519
with the much preferring the appearance
of gay characters in mainstream straight

231
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:04.639
shows
[Music]

232
00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:08.320
upon the announcement of the show's
final season extra magazine wrote about

233
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.519
why queer as folk was no longer needed
gay tv characters are now so common that

234
00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:17.440
their sexual preferences have become
invisible to most viewers

235
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.160
there have been gay parents on roseanne
gay undertakers on six feet under gay

236
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.279
doctors on chicago hope and er
gay prisoners on oz gay teens on

237
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:32.000
degrassi and even gay cartoons on south
park depictions of gay people on tv

238
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.240
don't seem to upset viewers the way they
used to gay cartoons on south park

239
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.120
fantastic representation others
in the gay press agreed though who

240
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.360
needed a show all about gay people when
we could be supporting straight people

241
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.600
on normal shows
smile mary the straights are watching

242
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.959
and they're judging you the underlying
argument and sometimes not even

243
00:16:54.959 --> 00:17:00.240
underlying being that a show like queer
as folk with its abundance of sex casual

244
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.480
drug use swearing and generally being
not safe for family viewing could only

245
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.240
hurt the community as it fought for the
right to be seen as just like the

246
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.160
straits and normal getting straight
america on our side so that we could

247
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.799
have gay marriage legalized was more
important than representation of queer

248
00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:21.199
characters who don't dream of suburban
life with two and a half kids that was

249
00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:24.480
the gay agenda
and a show like queer's folk could only

250
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.679
hurt that agenda because it dared to
show

251
00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:31.440
that not all of us actually wanted it
the goal of assimilation was only

252
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.240
achievable if we acted as a united body
if one of us spoke out in support of

253
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.000
lifelong promiscuity
there was a fear that some anita bryant

254
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.520
knockoff would point to that gay circa
queen and say

255
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.640
see
you don't deserve to be treated like us

256
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.760
because at least one of you is not like
us

257
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.840
interesting then that approval of
same-sex couples in america was growing

258
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.480
throughout the run of queers folk
but according to gallup polling and this

259
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.440
is hilarious in a sad make you want to
bang your head off of the kitchen

260
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.960
cabinet kind of way
approval dropped by five points the year

261
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.280
after the show ended maybe not having
that regular supply of queer characters

262
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.679
being unapologetically messy
actually hurt the cause

263
00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:17.039
it's hard to see us as the kind of
people you'd start up a chat with at the

264
00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:20.000
water cooler
if we're all made out to be saints and

265
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.799
murders and all too easy to see his
massive [ __ ] when we don't live up

266
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:30.240
to that lofty expectation i'm making
copies move i'm gay support continued to

267
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.960
drop reaching a boiling point in 2008
with the passage of proposition 8 in

268
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.960
california of all states a
constitutional amendment banning gay

269
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.200
marriage after it had been legalized for
a short time in 2004

270
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.600
in the years following queer as folk
lgbt characters continued to pop up in

271
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.360
more
what we can qualify as straight tv shows

272
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.600
though rarely in lead roles and never
sexually explicit this has been changing

273
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.200
more recently of course with shows like
how to get away with murder and any

274
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.799
number of streaming shows
but in the decade after queer's folk

275
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.799
ended queer characters existed in a
sexless wasteland

276
00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:10.720
and in many forms of mainstream media
still to this day remain trapped there

277
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.600
as gay networks like logo and otv began
cropping up we did start to see more

278
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.360
sexually active gay characters
but those were far from the mainstream

279
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.039
networks like showtime and usually
required you to subscribe to them

280
00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:27.760
individually in your cable package so a
household filled with straight people

281
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.360
wasn't likely to come across noah's ark
or x's and o's it wasn't until 2014 with

282
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.120
the release of looking on hbo that
another gay-centric scripted drama made

283
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.960
its way to mainstream cable
but looking never came close to the

284
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.840
raiding success of queer as folk
and only lasted for 18 episodes and a tv

285
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.000
movie to tie off the loose ends
it just didn't have the must-see tv

286
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.480
quality that queer as folk did and quite
frankly seemed to lack a lot of the

287
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.559
emotional punch that kept viewers tuning
in the feeling that you need to keep

288
00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:02.559
watching because you never know what
you'll see next queer as folk made you

289
00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:06.080
care about each and every one of the
characters their lives their struggles

290
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.240
their victories and as a gay guy in a
small town these characters

291
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.480
were my only gay friends queer as folks
started airing just as i started coming

292
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.280
out
yes twelve-year-old me was very excited

293
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.559
to let people know that i was gay i was
weird like that and because i had this

294
00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:24.159
support group of fictional gay
characters to hang out with every week

295
00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:28.240
it made coming out easy for me even
seeing the stresses and traumas of the

296
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.360
gay community like hiv gay bashing and
homophobic families i felt like it would

297
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.919
be okay because i saw that there were
other people out there just like me

298
00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:42.320
should i have been watching queer's folk
as a 12 year old maybe not but it's not

299
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.240
like there were any kid-friendly shows
about gay people on tv now were there

300
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.520
and if there had been disney probably
would have found a way to cancel them it

301
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.360
also acted as my sex ed class since the
show featured frank discussions of

302
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.679
sexually transmitted diseases and why
condom use was so important during the

303
00:20:57.679 --> 00:21:02.880
show's run every gay person i met all
online mind you was obsessed with the

304
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.520
show but then when it ended it seemed to
be completely forgotten by everyone

305
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.840
fans critics people who praised it for
pushing boundaries

306
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.440
so i couldn't help but wonder when shows
like sex in the city which one could

307
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.360
argue is the straight version of queer's
folk have gone on to have long lives

308
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.679
after their final episodes with movies
and a revival series

309
00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:28.080
why did queer as folk fade away into the
history of cable tv was it really just

310
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.000
that it wasn't needed anymore the gay
characters were appearing in straight

311
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.480
shows now so why would we need a show
just for them with it being a raiding

312
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.640
smash
why wasn't it until 2014 that another

313
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.760
network made a show about a group of gay
friends was queer's folk perfect

314
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.400
no
it's definitely a product of its time

315
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.320
with an almost entirely white cast
little to no trans representation and

316
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.159
with even bisexuality being an
afterthought but it was as the new york

317
00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:00.159
times said
genuinely revolutionary

318
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:04.559
it changed the way gay characters could
be portrayed on tv we didn't have to be

319
00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:08.640
sexless side characters hanging around
the periphery of the main cast in order

320
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.480
to be a punchline we could be
complicated we could have friends and

321
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.520
families of our own
we could have issues that weren't just

322
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.000
related to aids and gay bashing though
those were covered in detail

323
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.760
it showed the audience that there was so
much more to being gay than just loving

324
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.360
cher and madonna
though on june 9th a new version of

325
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.880
queer as folk did premiere on the
streaming service peacock

326
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.640
with a much more intersectional cast of
characters this might be the modern

327
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.559
update that we need
because in my opinion as queer people

328
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:42.720
are harassed out of more and more spaces
be they schools or locker rooms or

329
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.840
libraries or entire states
it's becoming clear to me the queer

330
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.080
inclusive spaces
simply aren't enough

331
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.280
despite what the gay press said in 2005
we really do still need exclusive queer

332
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.559
spaces too
places where we don't need to feel like

333
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:04.960
we need to put on a mask for the
cisgender heteros who judge us

334
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.679
for being the right kind of queer or not
who watch our every move to decide

335
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:14.240
whether or not we deserve rights
those spaces are still required and that

336
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.880
includes media spaces
we do in fact need shows and movies just

337
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.960
about us because we need to see
ourselves outside the sis hat norm we

338
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.679
might feel forced to adhere to
we need to see ourselves when we're with

339
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.919
other people like us
and i think with the new queerest folk

340
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.640
and the new movie bros coming out this
fall

341
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.799
major queer media producers might
finally be realizing this

342
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:41.919
they might as well make more shows and
movies just about us because it's not

343
00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:45.840
like we're going anywhere
the thumpa thumpa continues

344
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.039
it always will
no matter what happens

345
00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:53.200
no matter who's president no matter who
hates us no matter what idiot

346
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.919
politicians say no matter what [ __ ]
comedians say

347
00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:05.200
because as our lady of disco the divine
miss gloria gaynor has always sung to us

348
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.760
we will survive

349
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.679
you
