5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.660
I was a teenager teenagers you hate your

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.500
like ah I'm young again
uh in today's episode video whatever the

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.399
hell we call these things uh we're going
to be talking about how

8
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.940
Pride
kind of sucks

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.040
yeah I wanna I wanted to talk about like
more of the consequences the unspoken

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.379
consequences of Pride being corporate
Pride going mainstream yeah because like

11
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.420
I liked when people didn't like us

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.660
we seem to like each other more when
people didn't like us

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
yeah the gays got along more when we had
an enemy so like just not necessarily

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.039
talk about the history because that is a
big long discussion there will be a

15
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.159
documentary coming from tell us yeah
it's funny because we wanted to make it

16
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.000
a video and everyone wanted it to be a
video and then we I tried writing it for

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.020
Pride last year or the year before and I
looked I got like two paragraphs saying

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.780
like I like knock knock James
um this is big and it is it does have a

19
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.759
title it's called Pride for sale and it
will be coming from Telos pictures

20
00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.560

32
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.180
probably wouldn't make for a full video

succession and my rediscovery of anime

um so let's get into the video proper

44
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.040
now uh segment one

45
00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.200
um
let's talk about Pride let's talk about

46
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.959
Pride well pride is a sin it's a sin
it's also an incredibly weird it's not

47
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.459
one of those like really harsh bad sins
it's the the one of the seven deadly

48
00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.780
apex of the seven deadly sins yes it's
the bad one yeah and you can see that

49
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.280
element of judeo-christ there's a whole
discussion about like Niche and uh

50
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.260
ethics on morality and how he feels
about pride and the devaluing of Pride

51
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.920
um and whether that's good or bad and
whether that's good or bad depending on

52
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.099
which edit you're reading of him because
some of his Works were edited wonder

53
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.260
what Ein Rand would feel about Pride
I bet she would love Gay Pride Ein Rand

54
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.040
was very heavily inspired by Nietzsche
but

55
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.519
it also might have been the version of
Nietzsche that was doctored to make him

56
00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.120
more palatable to the Nazi party so his
sister could gain favor with them

57
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.319
after he died
yes and I'm not saying anything nice

58
00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.840
about irand no
um because we're not going to say

59
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.239
anything nice about Pride either
I think Ein Rand would be a fan of

60
00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.959
Nietzsche and philosophy students like
correct me if I'm wrong but I can almost

61
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.780
guarantee you Nietzsche would have
nothing but condemned frying around

62
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.380
not for the reasons you think though
um he would have thought she was a

63
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.860
pitiful Pretender I mean very much yeah
anyway this is an Iran podcast episode

64
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.800
we'll talk about it
eventually we will we will talk about

65
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.440
her but for now can we replace the the
10 000 patreon goal with from one piece

66
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.300
to Ein Rand maybe it's 7 500 patrons we
will do a feature-length documentary

67
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.860
about Iran because one piece has a lot
to do with like you know like greed and

68
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.660
corporatism and militarism like we could
incorporate Iran into that properly the

69
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.220
randian-ness of One Piece ten thousand
patrons you'll get it

70
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.600
okay all right so talk about Pride let's
talk about Pride so first of all first

71
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.139
of all for everyone who's listening the
little baby gays who don't know anything

72
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.600
about queer history watch more videos on
the channel you'll know but Pride as it

73
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.180
was originally conceived was not you
know the happy-go-lucky parade that you

74
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.120
bring your kids to in their strollers
and you know people Bop around with

75
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.060
rainbow balloons it was a protest
movement uh

76
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.660
starter people even say it was a riot
but that's it certainly started as one

77
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.220
that's if you're taking consideration
Stonewall the original PR

78
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.460
p-r-i-d-e movement which is personal
rights and Defense Education

79
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.780
um which occurred a few which was
disbanded a few months before the

80
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.240
Stonewall riots actually yeah right at
the end of 68 it stopped uh they not on

81
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.039
its own uh provocative group of Rights
advocators and they were very

82
00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.240
confrontational it was they did not
start any riots but they certainly did

83
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.520
protest yeah
um and the re-emergence of the pride

84
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.580
movement that we that began the modern
movement today it's the second Pride

85
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.139
movement I will say that very much was
born out of the riots that came out of

86
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.460
the Stonewall uh The Stonewall rests the
modern Pride movement yeah definitely

87
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.360
grew at a Stonewall
um and one could earn so it's a

88
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.440
fascinating history and the gay rights
in the late 60s and early 70s absolutely

89
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.160
fascinating yeah because it's it's you
would think that it's really like the

90
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.600
Gaze versus The Straits it's like no
it's actually the gays versus the other

91
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.880
other case that's that was the war going
on in the late 60s early 70s uh and

92
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.500
continued honestly to go on for a very
long time until this day probably it

93
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.639
started to swing in terms of the the
gays that were reverse reversing the

94
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.960
other gays probably that died off you
know probably with the 80s probably yeah

95
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.400
I think I think AIDS kind of you know
kicked everyone into I'm trying to

96
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.699
explain some people just how much Game
Changer AIDS was looking at gay history

97
00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.759
before for the 80s and then after but
you know

98
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:05.819
pride pride
so the question I want to ask is how can

99
00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.500
Pride still be a protest because
how can practice be a protest when we ha

100
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.419
when pride has corporate sponsors and
like we have corporate sponsors and we

101
00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:21.419
are very much we protest a lot yeah um
but I so I would say it's not how how

102
00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.860
can Pride be a protest when it's
financed by Banks yeah when you go to a

103
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.539
pride parade in Canada it is TD Bank
everywhere when you go to the US it's

104
00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:36.780
ameribank everywhere really yeah okay
yeah yeah I wonder it was it's not about

105
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.580
like corporates it's about when I say
corporate I I mean the hegemony I mean

106
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.960
the big money the the elements that are
kind of like pulling the oligarchy

107
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.759
oligarchic strings of our not just
America but our Western World yeah like

108
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:54.419
this isn't you know the art our sponsors
who are you know relatively smaller

109
00:07:54.419 --> 00:08:00.780
these are like the big Tech big Banks
um we're not being sponsored by like

110
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.819
Elon musk's yeah stuff like this this is
elements of money that are small Nations

111
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:11.220
unto themselves oh yeah uh Apple has
more money than most countries yes

112
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.479
um so like
if Pride needs to be a protest how can

113
00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:20.660
it protest when the culture itself is
sponsoring him like the the hegemonistic

114
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.180
determining factors of our culture which
are these financial institutions because

115
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.080
in our late stage in our mid to late
stage of capitalism that we're in that's

116
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:34.680
kind of how culture functions yeah and
it's it's it's it's it's something that

117
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.919
you know I I worked in marketing for a
very long time and we talked about you

118
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:47.580
know every every June okay how do we
appeal to the lgbtq community and even

119
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.380
back in business school we took courses
and about different marketing histories

120
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.320
and stuff like that and one of them was
specifically in the 1990s

121
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.880
the sort of the Power Players of
corporate America specifically Corporate

122
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.480
America
really realized that

123
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.940
gay and lesbian gays and lesbians
especially couples uh who at the time

124
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.279
were very very unlikely to have children
but they had dual incomes and on average

125
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:22.920
made more money than strike couples
um because gays and lesbians tended to

126
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.200
go into higher income Fields because
there was a a big kind of

127
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.220
um I must be better than my Straight
siblings kind of thing

128
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.560
um and so I still kind of have that
don't worry I don't the bar is not that

129
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.920
hot
but

130
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.899
um so you know gays and lesbians had a
lot of money and nobody was appealing to

131
00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:53.240
them and so a lot of people think that
um you know companies started to Market

132
00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.360
towards gay people to
to be inclusive

133
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.940
um
that they would start putting gay people

134
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.519
in their advertisements in their
commercials and stuff like that that

135
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:11.160
Disney started doing gay days at
Disneyland to you know say we are

136
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.800
inclusive of the the L's and the G's but
it was that's not how it worked so it

137
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.399
was specifically we were marketed
two we were not appealed to I we were

138
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.480
marketing I would do you one Higher and
say that the problem is that not that

139
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.680
the marketing was directed at the gays
it's that the gays were used as a

140
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.760
marketing tool to make this Corporation
seem palatable to left-leaning interests

141
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.980
and to the gays because they wanted to
Gay's money because it wasn't it wasn't

142
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.140
saying like look at us look how
inclusive we are it was and like this is

143
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.060
actual history they weren't saying this
is how inclusive we are they were saying

144
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.959
look there's two men sitting on a couch
in our commercial don't you want to buy

145
00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:59.519
our insurance don't you want to come to
Disneyland and it was that kind of thing

146
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:04.920
because gays and lesbians had lots of
money so if we're being oh sorry if

147
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.620
we're being used in this element of the
culture and being used as this kind of

148
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.820
you know tool to make this company this
Corporation seem palatable

149
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.660
um
we're being brought in to the very

150
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.959
culture that Pride originally protested
against

151
00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:26.940
yeah so going into our next segment
because Pride was originally very much

152
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.019
pushing back against the Strait of
Gemini and the CIS had hegemony kind of

153
00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:37.680
saying like we don't need to fit into
your boxes but you know in the early 90s

154
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.440
the the gays that because not all gays
and lesbians had a lot of money no but

155
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.940
the ones that did had a lot they they
had a lot and they played the game they

156
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.660
played the corporate game they worked in
the corporate offices you know they were

157
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.740
doctors and lawyers and business people
and CEO not so much CEOs but you know

158
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.300
they had they had money
um and they had that because they were

159
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:06.540
already existing within a conservative
frame of mind because you know at least

160
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.339
that fiscal conservative where it's like
I want low taxes but I want to feel like

161
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:16.320
a good person and not not just that but
kind of like you know the the ones the

162
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.120
gays that wouldn't set off your gaydar
kind of thing the ones who passed yeah

163
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.140
but you know we we're getting a lot
about you know Fringe elements of queer

164
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:30.240
Society who are being pressured to pass
yeah and so it was that kind of gay and

165
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.260
they were the ones being appealed to and
that is when gay pride started to become

166
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.680
very mainstream and the parades started
to become a thing that was on The Daily

167
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.399
News that wasn't like look at the freaks
it was more like look at the happy

168
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:50.820
people look how much they want to get
married and that started in the 90s and

169
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.519
it was because Corporate America decided
there's money over there in them Hills

170
00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:00.959
and we're not getting any of it yet so
the question is like

171
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:04.920
if as we are being brought into the
culture and being used as an element of

172
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.779
the culture if the culture is still
oppressing Us in some way how do we make

173
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:14.160
pride of protests when pride is part of
the hegemonistic culture well yeah how

174
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.779
do you protest the culture when the
culture sponsors you specifically the

175
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.440
question we need to ask before that is
is there anything worth protesting right

176
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.260
now
is there anything worth protesting I

177
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.060
don't know stay tuned
and we're back from an advertisement

178
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.500
from probably Corporate America
um let us know if it's Christian Ringle

179
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.700
oh some oh some of the ones man I love
hearing about throwing these videos

180
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:46.019
they're sometimes they're hilarious
um but yeah what like it is it worth PR

181
00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:50.820
is it worth the L's the G's the B's the
t's The Q's is it worth flipping the

182
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.700
pride table once again to say like no we
deserve stuff yeah like yeah a party we

183
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.600
um party's great when you celebrate the
things that you're winning but we're

184
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.180
losing an awful lot right now worth you
know sitting John Kent down and letting

185
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:11.279
him know that no Pride does still need
to not be a party John Kent yeah

186
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:16.560
Superman's son oh the one who in the
last uh Pride as you for DC kind of said

187
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.860
I know that Pride was a protest at one
point but now it's just a party it's

188
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:28.200
like little baby queer sit down right
down you're literally a Superman a white

189
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.820
Superman who lives in the penthouse in
an analogy for you know New York City

190
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:38.639
New York City like sit down yeah sit
your ass down boy but yeah so what is

191
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:44.459
worth protesting now and a couple of
years ago I would have said not much my

192
00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:48.240
biggest point was employment
non-discrimination employee that was my

193
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.300
big one I still think we should have
fought for employment non-discrimination

194
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.480
before marriage lots of people disagree
with me and that's perfect and that's

195
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.720
not saying that marriage isn't important
but in terms of priorities like I feel

196
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.839
like employment on discrimination needs
to be Paramount you you need your bottom

197
00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:05.880
line because in the America that exists
today in certain States you can get

198
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.040
married on Friday and then uh fired on
Monday for getting Gary gay married

199
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.620
um
so a couple of years ago I would have

200
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:19.260
said you know not much except that and
you know move out of those States but

201
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.480
now it doesn't seem to matter where you
live unless you live in California or

202
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.920
New York State somebody is coming for
you yeah I feel it's like a genie out of

203
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.320
the bottle situation where when people
discovered that hating specifically

204
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.000
trans people and now also non-binary
people was an option that oh I have

205
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.540
someone to hate awesome like well yeah
because it kind of was like they lost

206
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:47.880
the war for gay marriage and they were
like [ __ ] and then it became well we

207
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.380
gotta hate somebody yeah and then the
trans bathroom issue became a thing

208
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.760
which never should have been an issue to
begin with it never had been a thing

209
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.860
historically it's a it's a it's a it's
spoken mirrors and it's it's brilliant I

210
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:09.720
if I can find the clip I'll put it in
um a young trans man uh went to a a town

211
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.360
hall with a conservative Governor I
think uh Republican governor and said

212
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.040
look at me
I am a transgender man do you really

213
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.620
think that the girls in my high school
would feel comfortable sharing a

214
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.000
restroom with me and the governor just
swam around in circles to not answer

215
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.540
that question yes because it's like yeah
do you want him in the bathroom with

216
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.480
your daughter because they here's the
thing here's here's one of the things

217
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.940
that drives me nuts is the trans male
Erasure that happens with it they never

218
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.560
think of the men that you're putting
into the women's bathroom they're always

219
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.579
thinking about the trans women being in
women's bathrooms and it's like

220
00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:55.079
there's this is a two-way street
and I know you're uncomfortable with

221
00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:59.459
this get over it yeah
um you're gonna be a whole lot more

222
00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:03.060
uncomfortable with some of the trans
guys I know or a hell of a lot more

223
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.959
Butch than most of the straight guys
like immediately after like straight

224
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:11.699
guys the bathroom debate after the
bathroom debate started becoming a thing

225
00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:16.620
um immediately within like two weeks
there were CIS girls being beat up and

226
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.620
went from from being because they were a
bunch because they were bought they're

227
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:25.079
taught they were tomboys yeah
um just everything around this gender

228
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:31.140
debate is completely out of proportion
the trans people amount to about one

229
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.980
percent of the population if that yeah
it is not enough percent of the

230
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.039
population for anyone to get their
knickers and not about and that's the

231
00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:41.600
thing that's the thing that's the thing
that conservatives and

232
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.299
Republicans because some conservatives
are not bad on this I'm not trying to

233
00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:47.580
say like like because there aren't many
of them it's not important I'm saying

234
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.640
the opposite is like because there
aren't a whole lot of Trends and

235
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:58.080
genderness we should care about what
they do um but the thing is is that uh

236
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.539
Arch conservatives will say they are
really good at finding a section of the

237
00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:08.280
population that's very tiny that really
does not impact the rest of the

238
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.740
population whatsoever but they're
different enough to stand out yeah and

239
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.059
so even though they're this
tiny little group you can make them seem

240
00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:21.720
massive
and you know like in the UK it happens

241
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.559
it's been happening all the time where
they've been saying well there's you

242
00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:29.220
know eight thousand percent more trans
people now than there was ten years ago

243
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.340
and it's like yeah that means there's
like 800 more trans people than there

244
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.980
were 10 years ago calm down like most
trans people in the past did not

245
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.520
officially publicly or whatever
transition well there was no legal yeah

246
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.660
they did it without a doctor they diy'd
it a lot of people got hurt because they

247
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.860
were diying it which fed into statistics
about oh hormones destroy your body it's

248
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.700
like yes because they couldn't get legal
access to in order to stem dysphoria I

249
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.940
think that was that was dealt with on
pose like people having to use illegal

250
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.620
hormones and do illegal feminization
surgery and stuff like that like yeah

251
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.640
when that happens it's scary like let's
make that not happen it's like backroom

252
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.140
abortions like Barbara from the suburbs
will do anything to make her tits left

253
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.000
half an inch but like

254
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.140
they really should understand why
someone who has the wrong body and the

255
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.919
links they will go

256
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.820
away go to

257
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.539
to feel comfortable in their own body
um and yes

258
00:19:35.539 --> 00:19:42.539
why is it so goddamn okay for CIS people
to go and have all the the tit lifts and

259
00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:47.460
the butt lifts and the liposuction and
the dick extensions and the the I saw I

260
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:52.559
saw a man who had his like
face additions like the late full-on

261
00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:55.679
Lady Gaga Born This Way era like you
know

262
00:19:55.679 --> 00:20:00.660
um augmentations like on like like kind
of piping within his arm to kind of make

263
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.860
him look alien like his eyes were dot he
had tattoos in his eyes to make him look

264
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.000
dark his tongue was split bottom lip
kind of like split and bottom there and

265
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.160
he was discussing uh a way to get uh his
penis split into so we could have a Hemi

266
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.440
penis to be more freakish
doctors sign off on that I guess but

267
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.620
meanwhile you know people want to look
people wanna you know ubu yeah body

268
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.880
augmentation surgery I want ubu I am a
tried and true monster I'm kind of into

269
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.320
that so like so many beeping I'm gonna
have to do in this episode have you been

270
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.720
beeping that much I don't think so well
[Music]

271
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.799
um
the night is young yeah

272
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:45.120
so it's probably not acceptable that man
probably faces a lot of kind of weird

273
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.640
looks oh it must be a horrible time for
him at the same time there is which is a

274
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.960
horrible you know about society that we
would just look at someone and say no I

275
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.500
mean with the procedures he's getting he
probably has a money money as it is yeah

276
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.900
cause any that [ __ ] ain't cheap yeah so
on a level of he's not being broadcast

277
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.340
on CNN he's not being broadcast on Fox
News there are no one protesting his

278
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.559
existence like yeah there I mean yeah
there's a dichotomy there there is a

279
00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:16.559
very weird dichotomy there
um Elon Musk has had more gender

280
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:20.760
confirming surgery than most uh trans
people

281
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.559
um how many times does he has his scalp
replaced uh I want to know where he

282
00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:31.140
keeps getting new Scouts
how many Tesla employees are just

283
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:37.440
running around bald now because Elon
snatched their and weave at the assembly

284
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.580
line
so yeah

285
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.240
um
that's on the table in terms of just not

286
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.659
only the political persecution you know
there's because that's a thing but also

287
00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:52.500
just the social persecution of that uh
we're also no now going through another

288
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.480
round of book Bannings and book burnings
that have a weird way of you know

289
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.440
they're targeted at you know you know I
don't even know what the justification

290
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.559
is anymore oh it's everything it's
everything it's oh the it's it like

291
00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:09.539
because like it's like there's this this
book says that being black is okay so

292
00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:12.960
we're gonna be in that yeah this book
says that maybe we should do reparations

293
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.520
for slavery so we're gonna ban that this
book says that immigration is okay if

294
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.720
you're not white we don't want that
around uh this book says it's okay to be

295
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.919
gay or lesbian or trans or non-binary
this book says

296
00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:30.720
not even that but this book implies that
and it's like [ __ ] Mark Twain or

297
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.740
something sorry another beep another
beep

298
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.679
um this book was written by Margaret
Atwood so we're gonna throw this one out

299
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:42.720
like it's just and even then I saw like
some of the lists are like egregiously

300
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.559
misinterpreting what's the theme of
these books actually are yeah um in a

301
00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:49.500
lot of cases it's like no this book is
isn't pushing an agenda this book is

302
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.700
just a book yeah
so that's fun to have like when it's

303
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.100
just burning books because they don't
align with like this weird Christian Pop

304
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.700
thing like and a lot of this I mean I
know drag queens are being banned like

305
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.240
yes yes and we're going to get to that
in a second sorry um

306
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.559
but the all of this seems to be
happening I mean it's happening all over

307
00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:14.760
the US it's happening in England like
it's not it's not it's not restricted to

308
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:23.280
one area of the globe yeah but it's very
it seems to be radiating out of

309
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.179
America's dick that is Florida and
like Rhonda Sanchez is like I'm going to

310
00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:35.640
become the Republican nominee by out
trumping Trump yeah and I I want to like

311
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.460
take him by the head and say Ron at
least Trump is a liar but at least when

312
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:47.400
he started running for president he said
that Caitlyn Jenner could use any

313
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.940
bathroom she wanted in any of his
buildings but you know that's how he

314
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.720
started his campaign but you know I want
to credit Beyonce and he completely went

315
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.440
and lied through his teeth but in her
current Tour all the bathrooms on

316
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.539
Beyonce tour this tour
um are gender neutral everyone good good

317
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:05.700
for her yeah I didn't know she was
touring

318
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.880
um well she this is the Renaissance tour
okay

319
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.340
but like it it so it's just like you're
trying to out Trump trump by being a

320
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:20.419
bigger [ __ ] and all that's really
accomplished is pissing off Disney yeah

321
00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:26.280
you know what company you don't piss off
Disney they have lawyers that will come

322
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:32.820
for you and they will find you and like
18 pieces six months later honestly Iowa

323
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.380
different Disney characters stamped on
different parts of your body I would

324
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.360
know it'll be DreamWorks character to
hide their tracks

325
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.919
[Laughter]
I'd like to see a battle between Disney

326
00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:48.480
and Apple I think honestly I think that
being an apple why why

327
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.900
wasn't he an apple against each other no
this is hypothetically because like they

328
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.500
are renowned for having like
complete savagery in their legal

329
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.280
practices oh yeah so like I think
lawyers honestly I think that would

330
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.919
start a corporate War well like like an
open guns a lot of Disney yeah because

331
00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:08.580
because of Steve Jobs and Pixar and all
that stuff so that'd be that that would

332
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.559
be difficult but apple and Disney are
notoriously granted the UK owned a lot

333
00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:18.679
of America that's true until they didn't

334
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.659
but you know apple and Disney are you
know woke companies they're also two of

335
00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:29.039
the richest companies in the world
um the richest companies in the world

336
00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:34.500
are whoa it's hilarious the broke uh go
go go go broke campaign and yet that you

337
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.600
know doesn't yeah all that equates to is
people buying products to smash uh but

338
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.419
we're gonna take another commercial
break and then we're gonna come back and

339
00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:48.360
we're gonna talk about something else
that's growing out of Florida like a

340
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.520
growth on a
gross thing so yeah we'll be right back

341
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.840
and we're back but if you're a patron we
didn't really go anywhere

342
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.480
um so the the other thing that's kind of
grew out of Florida but has kind of it's

343
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:11.880
gone all over the US and England
is the groomer thing which has turned in

344
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.039
we know where the groomer language
started I I don't personally I'm I'm

345
00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:20.159
sure that well of course like the thing
about grammar is that this was the exact

346
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:25.799
language that was used to describe Us in
the agent late 1800s and the 1970s 50s

347
00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:31.380
1960s 1970s yeah it was always the gays
are coming for your kids and then it was

348
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.860
oh we can't go after the gays because
everyone has decided that the gays are

349
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.400
okay because the gay marriage Etc so
we're going after the trans people uh

350
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.860
we're going after them oh and we're
going after the non-binaries because

351
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.679
they're even weirder
go ahead

352
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.220
yeah so it was kind of then it started
they started seeing it work against

353
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.140
trans people and they were like ooh I
hadn't made that connection yet yeah

354
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.679
they said it wasn't until they started
it started working against trans people

355
00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:05.279
and their group like specific language
they are grooming teenagers to become

356
00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:10.020
trans so we need to increase their the
age in which you can legally transition

357
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.039
and then when that started and then they
were like oh this is working so then

358
00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:18.179
they started going after drag queens
because that was you know it's kind of

359
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:22.919
like being trans to them in real life
it's not but to them it's basically

360
00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:26.460
being trans
but then because so many gay men are

361
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.360
well not so so many drag queens are gay
men

362
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.140
it became oh well if it's drag queens
it's gay men too yeah and then everybody

363
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.799
started getting locked in and then you
know lapping in the lesbians because of

364
00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:42.120
course which is exactly what we said
would happen yeah we said that and then

365
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.620
gays were like they're not coming
like we is in like trans people

366
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.020
non-binary people kind of looking at the
those systems with the brain the the

367
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.080
more privileged elements of the queer
Community typically the white gay and

368
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.919
lesbian people saying like this isn't
going to stop stop with calling us

369
00:27:58.919 --> 00:28:03.179
groomers they are going to Loop you in
with this regardless and they were like

370
00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:08.159
no if we just just distance ourselves
from you they will keep us that they

371
00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:11.159
will you're saying that the privileged
one said yeah we just need to distance

372
00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:14.940
yeah if we just distance ourselves when
you if we demonstrate that we're not

373
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:21.360
with you then we'll be safe so the
privileged gays and lesbians did say if

374
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.080
we just distance ourselves from trans
people and non-binary people and drag

375
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.260
queens they're not going to come for us
because they'll know that we're the good

376
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.400
ones the George Santos is of the world
he doesn't exist but what ended up

377
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.659
happening of course although he did do
drag what ended up happening of course

378
00:28:36.659 --> 00:28:42.059
are pretty as a drag queen uh it doesn't
exist doesn't exist uh but of course

379
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:47.520
what ended up happening when trans
people and you know queer people with

380
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.320
any amount of brain matter yeah said no
no we've seen this brain matter

381
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.580
historical reference like this has
happened the poem first they came for

382
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.900
the the Communists to the unionists or
the I think it's I think it started with

383
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.059
bankers and then Communists and then
business owners well no it was first

384
00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:09.000
they came for I think it was first they
came for the Jews and then they came for

385
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.659
the the union leaders and then they came
for the Communists and when it was only

386
00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:15.779
me left there was no one left to fight
for me yeah yeah I can't remember it I'm

387
00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:18.779
so sorry I can't remember the exact
quote but it was that all over again

388
00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:23.340
only within the queer Community
something they had had their way there

389
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.120
would be no one left to fight the fight
now that they are coming for you know

390
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.200
the CIS gays and lesbians and this is
the thing because the thing is our trans

391
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.899
brothers and sisters and others siblings
siblings siblings are made of tougher

392
00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:40.559
stuff than most of us and so they're
still around to fight the fight because

393
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:44.640
they're not giving up just because
they've been put through Hell by these

394
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.399
[ __ ] they've got a taste of
acceptance and I'm glad they did because

395
00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:51.179
they know that trans people okay yeah
yeah yeah

396
00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:55.740
um not the acceptance that they need to
be functional human beings on a larger

397
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.520
scale well they're functional human
beings but it's like not the acceptance

398
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.960
they need for yeah I'm using I'm sorry
I'm using very oh my thinker isn't

399
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.159
working
my finger's malfunctioning it's not the

400
00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:12.179
um it's like the acceptance that they
need to get the kind of absolutely the

401
00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:15.600
kind of self-actualization that we take
that a lot of the privileged elements of

402
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.659
society take for granted yeah and you
know so they trans people kind of it was

403
00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:27.000
with uh the the trans Tipping Point
issue on variety I think it was

404
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.539
um I think it might have been variety or
The Hollywood Reporter

405
00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:35.399
um or maybe it was
maybe it was Vanity Fair it doesn't

406
00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:39.480
matter yeah it doesn't matter
um Laverne Cox was on the cover and she

407
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.100
was the first trans woman to be put on
the cover of a major magazine I thought

408
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.539
Caitlyn Jenner no no no no no no before
he does not get that credit okay

409
00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:52.799
um do not take that away from Laverne
Cox no no yeah

410
00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.799
um but I just I thought that was kind of
like a sad thing like oh it should have

411
00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:59.279
been it should have been and it was this
it was this moment of

412
00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:04.440
oh Trans people are actually you know
getting accepted now not just being

413
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.899
written off as Freaks and then you know
the arch conservatives Among Us saw that

414
00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:14.100
and instead of looking at that magazine
and saying Laverne Cox seems like a

415
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.120
really nice lady they looked at it and
they were like this is a target yeah we

416
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.600
have a new Target because they unite
themselves through hatred they unite

417
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.159
themselves through having something to
hate and in a large part this and for

418
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:30.779
the longest time you may wonder and I
certainly did why these people are so

419
00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:35.399
invested on needing someone to hate why
do we need to bully people into this

420
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:40.080
very rockwellian American rockwellian
even for British standards whatever the

421
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.779
British standards of rockwellian is or
the Europeans and it's Rockwell that

422
00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:47.460
idea that there is a nice polite society
and a correct way of living and a

423
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.320
correct way of being and this is how
people should exist

424
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.360
um and badgering people into that box
why are we so obsessed with doing this

425
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.940
and it's because and who's driving this
yeah and it's because that sells yeah if

426
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.620
people are in these boxes then people
who sell them things know how to sell

427
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.679
them these things yes they know how to
tell them what they need to buy the

428
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:13.679
whole concept of keeping up with the
Joneses your next-door neighbors the

429
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:17.520
Joneses get a new dishwasher you want a
new dishwasher and that's the thing

430
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.500
that's going on and has been going on
with pride for a while is that you know

431
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.679
certain segments of the queer Community
are kind of like

432
00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:30.659
not excommunicated but like oh we hope
they don't show up because they don't

433
00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:34.620
fit in or specifically we're told not to
show up yeah but they're never told to

434
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.899
not show up by the banks no they're told
to show up by the queers oh who do you

435
00:32:39.899 --> 00:32:45.299
think by the queers who you know they
don't the let's say Suburban queers and

436
00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:48.659
you know they like that pride is being
financed by Banks because that means

437
00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:52.620
they're being accepted you think for a
second that the banks don't have a

438
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:58.380
specific liaison to contact to contact
the organizers of Pride festivals I know

439
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.640
they do they have that on speed dial
that's on their favorite five okay like

440
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.299
I worked in marketing like I think they
have a family plan it's like no money

441
00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:10.320
for calling like they have them locked
down

442
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.820
um and I I worked for a pride
organization and I saw the conflict that

443
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.200
went on with the people who honestly
wanted to make this an advocacy thing

444
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.260
and who didn't want to have Bank
advertising everywhere but it's like

445
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.760
what are those things sitting on the
ticket counter those are little money

446
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.140
boxes the little piggy bank things for
with the bank logo on them why are they

447
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.799
there it's like and it's like they're
not pays for everything they're not bad

448
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:39.419
people they're very smart people they
know exactly what's going on but they

449
00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:43.140
have the pride organizers the banks The
Pride organizers they know exactly

450
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:47.940
what's happening yeah and being there I
saw some of them they really hated it

451
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.700
they really hated that they had to sell
their soul and in a poetic context in

452
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.399
order to get a little bit what they want
in order to have the funding they need

453
00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:00.480
to put on the party to get enough money
to cover the costs in order to get their

454
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.539
their talking segments that nobody who
attended yeah

455
00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:07.080
um to get their discussion about like
issues within the queer community and

456
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.260
get these out there and get talking
about them and push boundaries having

457
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.099
like speakers speakers come in who could
talk about being queer in a person of

458
00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:18.540
color being here and disabled yes talk
about they had to give the banks what

459
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.659
they wanted in order to actually have
these important but because like but

460
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.720
because the Straits weren't showing up
for that the strikes were showing up for

461
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.280
you know Katya to come but there is we
love Katya but we love Katja there is so

462
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.960
much pressure for these festivals to
turn a buck yeah

463
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.260
um so that the sponsors can get their
you know funding back they must be

464
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.720
profitable it's not even that so the
sponsors can get their money back

465
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.560
because the sponsors that's that's
advertising oh yeah it's marketing it's

466
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.119
and it's it's cheap I don't know what
the actual figures are but I'm sure that

467
00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.879
like in New York City it's more
expensive to have a pride in New York

468
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:56.460
but I I bet you for anything buying a a
float in a pride parade is cheap

469
00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:02.580
probably the most efficient marketing
dollars you can spend I would not doubt

470
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.420
you uh having your logo on a on a coffee
cup is probably more expense because I

471
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.780
will this is one thing I've got to say
about the queer community

472
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.320
if you are a company and I don't know
exactly what the exact numbers are I did

473
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.040
not poke my thing my nose in any ledgers
but from hearing people talk about how I

474
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.660
know how much it was to do like certain
smaller cities in Canada and it was

475
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.540
cheap
um but that is one thing that I will say

476
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.800
about the queer Community when a company
when an organization gets the queers on

477
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.619
their side we are dedicated
the queers

478
00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:42.960
will go every year on a Disney cruise
gays

479
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:50.640
are dedicated customers whether that is
to a brand or a Singer TV shows we we

480
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.180
don't stop until it goes away and the
gays have still not bought Russian vodka

481
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.300
again

482
00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.160
boycotting Russian vodka before it was
cool we are dedicated consumers

483
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.480
and so they know okay if we're gonna
spend you know five thousand dollars on

484
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.500
this float in this pride parade and now
all this these hundred thousand people

485
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.300
who love the gays they now see us as
supporting gays we now have a hundred

486
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.640
thousand customers and it only cost them
five grand to do it that is pennies

487
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.859
compared to what it would be for like a
television advertisement in order to

488
00:36:22.859 --> 00:36:26.339
cover the costs of Pride to put on the
festival that the sponsors Express

489
00:36:26.339 --> 00:36:30.599
expect that the people expect to break
to Dragon drag queens from across the

490
00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:36.599
world like if you're even in a small
town and you have your town is big

491
00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:40.320
enough to have a pride festival you're
gonna have at least one girl from drag

492
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.859
race
really because they will find the money

493
00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:47.160
to get that one girl from drag race you
might not have anything else you might

494
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.099
have a parade and one drag show and
that's all you get but you're getting a

495
00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:55.680
drag race girl and because and you know
power to them like girls get the money

496
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.780
but
The Pride organizations look at it as we

497
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.520
need to bring in this person because
then you know if we have a drag race

498
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.240
Queen even if they got eliminated first
uh if we have her Miss vangie man vangie

499
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.680
um if we have her
people will come in and people will

500
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.180
spend money and if they're spending
money at our pride event more sponsors

501
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.500
will come in next year
and it'll just keep the ball rolling and

502
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:31.440
that is capitalism yeah and that is the
kind of the problem is that but how do

503
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.300
you disconnect Pride
the need for it to be how do you

504
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.079
disconnect the need for it to be a party
as per its corporate connections with

505
00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:44.339
the fact that corporations don't want to
protest no they want a party yeah they

506
00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:48.119
want to party because parties can make
money when you have a party you can set

507
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:51.300
up vodka stands you can set up drink
tables you can sell drink tickets you

508
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.980
can get people excited you can get you
can sell tickets you can't get people in

509
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.460
to talk people don't want to hear about
sad stuff I remember once there was a

510
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.320
trans woman who stole the stage at
Stonewall during a pride month and she

511
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.640
got booed off she started talking about
I remember that Brand's problems because

512
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.599
that was a pride year that it was just
not discussed and lo and behold the next

513
00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:16.440
year was the year that bathroom that the
bathroom debate started happening yeah

514
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.040
um
you know there's a uh there's a there's

515
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.900
a tweet that kind of spurred me to want
to talk about this it was a uh James is

516
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.920
going to put it up but it says for pride
month this year can straight people

517
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.119
focus Less on Love Is Love and more on
queer and trans people are in danger

518
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:36.660
because it's true but we can't talk
about that because people don't spend

519
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.780
money when they're sad or concerned
people spend money when they're happy

520
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:43.500
they're not going to spend money to
finance a protest against anything

521
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.140
anything they're not going to spend
money to finance a protest against

522
00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:54.240
anything anything at all so it can't be
a protest anymore Pride can't be a

523
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.660
protest because pride has become
corporatized and it's not that Pride

524
00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.579
itself needs to turn a profit Pride
itself needs to make break even so that

525
00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:08.460
it can exist next year yeah it needs the
sponsors and so Pride

526
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:16.560
as a party cannot coexist
cannot really exist as it should when

527
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.240
the queer community in any given country
where this Pride Celebration is

528
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:27.260
happening is under assault and you know
if you live in in San Francisco

529
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.140
you're probably like what assault we're
fine

530
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.400
if you have a house or an apartment
you're not living on the street but

531
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.940
because yeah and God for we talk about
queer homelessness oh but you know if

532
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.900
you live in a place that is very very
Progressive very open-minded toward

533
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.960
queer issues you might think that you
know

534
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.780
yay Pride Celebration
your pride celebration in Manhattan in

535
00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:01.619
San Francisco in Seattle in Toronto in
Montreal they need to be protests just

536
00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:08.760
as much as a pride festival that happens
in in Dayton Florida because like these

537
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.579
Urban centers represent some of the
largest voting bodies in in on this

538
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.640
continent well it's not even about
voting it's not about voting like in my

539
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.079
opinion it's not about voting it's about
messaging yeah you need to show that

540
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:26.339
okay it's not just the game because it's
not even showing you know Ron desantes

541
00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:29.820
that people in New York hate him because
he doesn't give a damn about people in

542
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:37.320
New York it shows the public
no okay it shows people it shows the

543
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.320
trans teenager in Florida who has just
been told if your parents even take you

544
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.460
out of state so that you can go on
hormones you're going in the system and

545
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.420
your parents are going in jail yeah it
shows that that it shows that that

546
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.880
teenager that there are people all
across this country who give a [ __ ]

547
00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.579
about you yeah they actually care about
you they are willing to give up their

548
00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:08.820
party so that they can show you that you
matter okay yeah that means I like that

549
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.720
I hadn't thought about that my angle is
uh I do like that yeah

550
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:24.180
so my angle is that
the idea of a protest isn't to sort of

551
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.720
spread that kind of advocacy the idea of
a protest is to let the general people

552
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.200
know that you know
this group of people is suffering you

553
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.740
know you protest a show like hey this is
an injustice against me I need to let

554
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.060
people know this by making Pride a party
you're telling these kind of

555
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.900
left-leaning progressive loving set not
not necessarily Progressive but sort of

556
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.440
very centrists the left-leaning who want
to do good things but maybe you're a

557
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.280
little bit fiscally preservative the
Hillary Rodham the the you're

558
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.359
reinforcing the idea to them these you
know like I said the largest voter

559
00:41:54.359 --> 00:41:57.660
blocks in America are in urban centers
those are where most of the voters come

560
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.300
from those are the where most of the
voting people come from and they usually

561
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.740
lean towards them but America's voting
is so messed up that 20 like 100 million

562
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.859
people in California there's not 100 the
idea in California but 100 million

563
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:10.380
people in California could vote against
the Republicans but then they could

564
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.560
still win most of the population lives
in urban centers so that's where you're

565
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:18.480
going to get the largest sort of message
to and these Urban centers are more the

566
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.560
thing is though like the the the the the
kid the the queer kid in you know Idaho

567
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.800
with the the homophobic or transphobic
parents

568
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.440
can't afford to move to San Francisco
I'm not saying that I'm saying that by

569
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.160
presenting the idea of a protest to
these people to these straight people in

570
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.420
these Urban centers is going to remind
them that it's not all you know roses

571
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.359
and sunshine for the queer Community
yeah whereas literally it's not all

572
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:49.140
right yes which is going to in not all
rainbows is a good idea for like a

573
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.020
non-fiction book like a book of message
or something I've always bet the

574
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:57.420
non-fiction writing we'll reinforce the
idea that it's not all all roses not all

575
00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.220
rainbows and sort of influence them to
make decisions in the legislation they

576
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.200
want to see their representatives push
onto into their politics yeah which will

577
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.220
be less targeted towards trans people
which will force some sort of

578
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.460
nationalistic sort of Standards like
that's my kind of thought process but

579
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.819
like a bigger picture
um and absolutely you're right that kind

580
00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:21.780
of reinforces reinforcing these messages
of solidarity is super important for

581
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.380
individuals but in terms of like
actually changing minds and developing

582
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.800
the kind of change we want to see in
order to happen to get these protections

583
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.099
I think it's absolutely important to
continue demonstrating elements of

584
00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:36.780
protest at a Centrist population that is
comfortable with the idea of I want to

585
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.020
support queer people I don't see
suffering queer people I don't know how

586
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.319
queer people are suffering therefore I
think everything's fine and I have those

587
00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:46.380
people in my life who have had to
explain like no there is so like we need

588
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.380
these kind of so what you're saying I
think we're very much in agreement oh

589
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.440
yeah absolutely let's do two different
angles but we're yeah absolutely we need

590
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.540
the New York news Market to cover you
know the pride parade because then the

591
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.780
whole country sees it yeah there needs
to be an urban interest in these things

592
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.440
rather than a Centrist dismissal that
everything's fine because my pride

593
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.240
festival is a party and those gays look
pretty happy yeah like like the average

594
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:14.280
those those ripped gay boys are having a
great time everything must be fine those

595
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.319
Georges and marthas need to be aware
that things aren't all okay and they

596
00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:22.440
need to be aware of the severity to
which things aren't all okay even if

597
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.460
things are okay in their neighborhood
yeah and and that's because the gays

598
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.599
that live in their neighborhood is are
probably doing fine yes absolutely but

599
00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:35.099
you know drive an hour away and I bet
you can find a whole lot of queer people

600
00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:38.640
who are not doing it conversion therapy
is still legal in a lot of States as far

601
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.180
as I'm aware yes
and specifically in the UK they wanted

602
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:48.720
to bet they put they did not pass a ban
on conversion therapy a national UK ban

603
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.380
on conversion therapy because the
lawmakers refused to make an exception

604
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.339
to include trans people yeah that they
refused to say no you can't you can't

605
00:44:56.339 --> 00:45:00.839
conversion therapy anyone and uh
opponents were like uh no it needs to

606
00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:06.420
say you can't you can you can conversion
therapy trans people yeah but and and

607
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.119
they were that refused to get added so
the band just got thrown out and there's

608
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:13.560
and there's people who would consider
themselves very Progressive people who

609
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.339
you know are very much in favor of gay
marriage of gay you know gays having

610
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:22.560
kids you know gay books in schools all
that kind of stuff but then they hear

611
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.900
about like oh this 16 year old is trans
and they're like oh and it makes them

612
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.900
uncomfortable and I I don't think it
comes from a place of malice I think

613
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.740
it's no it's it's ignorance yeah
ignorance and so we need to educate them

614
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.760
but at the same time it's like
that's that's what this whole channel is

615
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.980
about because I hate the idea of trans
people feeling like they need to educate

616
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.079
the ignorant yeah and like I I am a
white cisgender

617
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:53.640
gay but passing for straight most times
person passing frustration until you

618
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.400
talk about musical theater
or Sex in the City

619
00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.780
[Laughter]
and so you know when I make videos

620
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.140
talking about trans rights and the
rights of non-binary and genderqueer

621
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.440
people that's why I do it because I'm
like you know I'm not the best messenger

622
00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.540
but the thing about that is
um yes there are some things that people

623
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.140
need to advocate for themselves and I
don't like advocating for everything

624
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.859
that anything that I haven't seen
someone strongly advocate for in a

625
00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:29.160
context of many people sort of chiming
in on this

626
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.640
um and I always sort of lean towards
inclusion or even if it's you know

627
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.940
something I'm not familiar on it's like
let's include people because there's no

628
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.720
harm including people there's never any
harm include including people

629
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.099
um
so but even then one of the most

630
00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:47.280
significant things a transfer never said
to me is that it's really important that

631
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.480
someone who isn't trans can see me
that I that I feel seen by someone who

632
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.380
isn't trans that it's not just a matter
of like visibility in the trans

633
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.160
Community stays in the trans Community
like I you know I I he turned my opinion

634
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.339
on that I think it's important that
people from outside of certain

635
00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:06.000
communities acknowledge and respect that
these communities exist and they have

636
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.859
their own cultures and their own
absolutely but I don't what I'm sort of

637
00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:13.440
saying is I don't think oh yeah I'm
agreeing with you absolutely oh yeah

638
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.500
yeah
um just to clarify I don't think trans

639
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:22.260
people should be required to educate CIS
people it's exhausting being like yeah

640
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.460
like trans people should be allowed to
just exist and you know and if you don't

641
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:30.240
want to explain sort of trans queer
theory that that's on you if you want to

642
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.140
by all means but you shouldn't be called
to do that yeah you shouldn't be forced

643
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.220
to yeah but that's that's not what we're
talking about how Pride

644
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:43.920
was
a riot and now it thinks it's a party

645
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.420
there needs to be something to draw the
people's attention to the matter at hand

646
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.700
of the matter at hand is that we are
still in danger yes that everyone in the

647
00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:00.660
queer Community whether they are gay or
lesbian or bisexual or trans or

648
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:06.960
non-binary or pansexual or genderqueer
we are all in danger

649
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.339
because
whether you know it or not no matter how

650
00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:16.680
much privilege you have no matter the
high mountain that you think you live on

651
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:21.599
with your you know your your gated
community and you think the world can't

652
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:27.240
come and get you and you see people on
the news saying you know

653
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:33.240
these trans people have been murdered or
there's a new bill Banning trans kids

654
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.339
from existing and you think well that's
not me

655
00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:43.640
you need to add on to that
yet
