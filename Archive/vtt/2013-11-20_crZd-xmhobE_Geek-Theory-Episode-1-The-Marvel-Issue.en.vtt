00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been
an incredibly interesting experiment by

2
00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
Disney and Marvel Studios it's creating
new interest in the comics his almost

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.910
single-handedly turned superhero movies
into hollywood's new giant cash cow and

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.800
it's expanding the Cinematic Universe is
spilling over onto TV with agents of

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
shield and Netflix with the recently
announced during a miniseries they plan

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.539
on producing and that's great I wasn't
even a big fan of Marvel before the

7
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
movie started coming out and now I read
multiple Marvel books each month I used

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.000
to only read Batman but I feel like
they're squandering their potential

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
Marbles been doing great but they have
had a few missteps nothing big enough to

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.420
really draw attention but they've had a
few such as thor marvel decided i'm

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
making a thor movie because at the time
he was one of the few semi major

12
00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.449
characters they still held the rights to
they didn't own spider-man and they

13
00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.770
didn't own the x-men in fact the only
big name they held the rights to was the

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
Hulk a year or two later of course an
iron man would be one of the best-known

15
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
superheroes on the planet thanks in no
small part to Robert doing jr. but when

16
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.130
they started this cinematic universe
journey they didn't have a lot to pick

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.710
from if they made a Thor movie it could
work toward an Avengers movie so they

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.460
made it and it worked out pretty well
but it was no blockbuster to say the

19
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.619
least it did well grossing about 480
million dollars worldwide but compared

20
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.210
to the vast majority of superhero movies
coming out at the time and since that's

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
a pretty paltry number the sequel thor
the dark world has recently been

22
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.570
released and is on track to do more or
less the same at the box office but it

23
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
had a bigger budget captain america
actually made less than Thor but it

24
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
received much higher praise from critics
and its sequel the Winter Soldier looks

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.079
like it's going to be a more traditional
Hollywood action movie which could lead

26
00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.149
to better box office performance what
does Marvel have coming up next

27
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.600
guardians of the galaxy a series that I
certainly hadn't heard of before it was

28
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.780
announced and one that features
characters including a gun-toting

29
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.450
raccoon and a talking tree I've spoken
to quite a few hardcore Marvel fans and

30
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.330
even they're not all that excited for it
interested yes but not really excited

31
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.770
after that we have the Avengers sequel
age of Ultron which will probably be

32
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.280
amazing and gross like two billion
dollars and it's introducing the Scarlet

33
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.400
Witch character which I'm really excited
about because that could lead to some

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.020
seriously dramatic and amazing
storylines in the future go ahead and

35
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.340
look up the Scarlet Witch girl has
issues but then after age of Ultron we

36
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.510
have ant-man I never heard of ant-man
before I read The Young Avengers comics

37
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.890
and even there he was at a very small
role the biggest Marvel fans I know are

38
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.770
even worried about how that one's going
to turn out and of course then there's

39
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.690
agents of shield which has been so
lovingly nicknamed CSI Marvel comic book

40
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.380
fans don't think that there's enough
Marvel in the show while casual viewers

41
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.819
think that it's two comic booky it's
improved since the earlier episodes but

42
00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.440
the ratings have been decreasing
steadily each week it has had a full

43
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.790
season picked up though but one can't
help but wonder if that's less because

44
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.480
of popular demand and more because
Disney doesn't want to admit that not

45
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.730
everything from Marvel Studios as gold
now Marvel's in a pickle because Robert

46
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.440
Downey jr. has said he doesn't want to
do any more solo Iron Man movies iron

47
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.090
man has been by far the most successful
solo series that Marvel has released the

48
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.459
trilogy having grossed almost 2.5
billion dollars worldwide no other

49
00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.959
Marvel movie can touch iron man except
spider-man would they don't actually own

50
00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.860
the production rates too sure the
Avengers made more money but Tony Stark

51
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.200
was front and center in that as well so
what can Marvel do well Iron Man is

52
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.769
successful because people like to think
they can relate to Tony Stark yes he's

53
00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.570
rich and brilliant but he's got problems
just like everyone else people relate to

54
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.250
spider-man because Peter Parker is in
every man people relate to the x-men

55
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.350
because they appeal to the minority in a
Cell the put-upon emergen alized have

56
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:11.570
you tried not being a mutant can you
relate to Thor a literal god but like I

57
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.620
said Marvel and Disney aren't allowed to
make spider-man or x-men movies even

58
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.260
though they would probably love to get
their hands back on their most popular

59
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.640
and relatable characters but you better
believe Sony and Fox are not going to

60
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.840
give up their grip on those franchises
so what can Marvel do they need to start

61
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.919
another franchise with a hero that
people can relate to personally I hope

62
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.220
this turns out to be the young avengers
series but that's probably just a pipe

63
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.840
dream and not even feasible until phase
four at the very earliest probably phase

64
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.620
five but they really do need to
introduce some characters that people

65
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.260
can relate to captain america and thor
are fun but not really relatable there

66
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.370
are so many amazing characters in Marvel
who could easily support their own movie

67
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.330
and could grab the audience's like Iron
Man has but they're not doing anything

68
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.760
with them as a movie fan and a superhero
fan I really want marble to succeed in

69
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.440
this but I fear they might be going a
little too far out for mainstream

70
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.510
audiences to follow let me know what you
think do you think Marvel is squandering

71
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.930
an opportunity or do you think they're
doing it all just right let me know in

72
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.590
the comments below I'll be back next
week with another episode so until then

73
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.520
