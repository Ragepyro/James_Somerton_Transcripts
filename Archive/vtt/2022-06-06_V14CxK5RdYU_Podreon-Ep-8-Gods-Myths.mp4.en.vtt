00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.360
about this you get us started i'm like
okay james tell me about your early

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.840
fantasy james 10 minutes talking yeah uh
so yeah i guess i'll just reiterate um

22
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.600
the expedited version my my earliest
kind of foray into fantasy

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.640
was a thousand and one nights um because
i was a super fan of aladdin and so i

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.079
started reading
the source material which i think was a

25
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.720
much sanitized version like it was kind
of the children's book version

26
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.680
version
uh no not the way

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.399
figuratively yeah
um

28
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.759
and so i read that because i was like
super nerd child

29
00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.159
um
actually i think it was like a duck

30
00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.040
tales book wow of it i think that's cool
um

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.520
and then you know continued to be a nerd
and then hercules came out disney's

32
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.840
hercules because everything is about
disney

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.319
um and
it's about disney from the era when

34
00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.680
disney stayed in this lane
yeah

35
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.239
but then i became absolutely infatuated
with greek mythology specifically um

36
00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.000
hades in the mythology around hades and
persephone and this the spring and

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.440
demeter and all that kind of stuff
um

38
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.680
i just found that endlessly fascinating
didn't really care about the heroes or

39
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680
anything yet uh didn't know
like achilles and patrick list now that

40
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.040
you mentioned that like i was really
excited to take classics classes in

41
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.440
university
and

42
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.800
uh there were two primarily classics
courses that focused around mythology

43
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.160
one of them was like heroes and one of
them was the gods

44
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.080
they weren't offering the gods course
when i was going in and that's lame i

45
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.959
just went through the heroes course
which not only was very very lame

46
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.800
but very very lame but like
it was the most boring class i'd ever

47
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.959
been to
so yeah my professors had no charisma it

48
00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.720
was just ridiculous my university had no
classes like that but i did take a class

49
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.040
on urban mythology oh that would be so
cool which which was literally like you

50
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.239
know like the
you get into your car after a late shift

51
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.080
and there's someone in the back seat and
like urban myths and stuff it was it was

52
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.879
really cool um
but yeah so i became obsessed with greek

53
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.239
mythology
uh just dove down that rabbit hole and

54
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.040
like i was i said in our last go-around
my only disappointment with it because

55
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.159
as i was being becoming obsessed with
this it was right around the time that

56
00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.239
we were coming up to the millennium and
because i was a very anxious child and i

57
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.760
have grown into a very anxious adult
um i was

58
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720
horrified at the concept of the end of
the world

59
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.760
um because one day in a convenience
store as we were buying like chips or

60
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.480
something for a wrestling show that
night

61
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.599
um
crisps for uh our british listeners

62
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.680
um
[Music]

63
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.400
there was you know some tabloid rag
on the magazine shelf and it was like

64
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.000
the world will end on january 1st 2000
and that did not sit well with me

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.560
um
so i know it went from you know like

66
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.160
computers are gonna start crashing too
the world is going down oh yeah jesus is

67
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.800
coming back yeah uh this was
specifically what this was uh it said

68
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.919
like jesus is coming back jesus is
coming to judge you or something like

69
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.080
that like isn't the actual like capital
m millennium like a few years after the

70
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.919
lower case evidence such a confusing
mess

71
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.600
um
so i had a great tribulationist uh

72
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.560
christianity folks like
so i had a

73
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.680
horrible fear of the end of the world
and so

74
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.639
i was disappointed that there wasn't a
like set in stone

75
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.360
apocalyptic myth in greek mythology but
there is the the sort of resurgence of

76
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.160
the titans it's kind of it's never
depicted as kind of vague and

77
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.000
foreshadowed yeah like i think it's like
the second titanomachy is kind of the

78
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.680
end of the world
um

79
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.479
actually they won the gigantic that was
there were hercules helped them with

80
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.240
that hercules pan and all of the young
the second generation gods were involved

81
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.960
in legitimacy yeah cause you because it
was like a part of the myth that the

82
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.560
gods couldn't win but humans could or
something like that um

83
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.960
and uh
so yeah i think it was like the second

84
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.840
titanomachy is the apocalypse of greek
myth

85
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.800
um
so i like started looking into other

86
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.400
like apocalypse myth which there's
there's quite a few like especially from

87
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.759
like south american oh yeah mythology
and stuff like that but the one i really

88
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.639
gravitated toward was ragnarok ragnarok
from north smith which got me into north

89
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.759
smith and learning all about that
um

90
00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.520
but just like learning about ragnarok is
like i said before

91
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.560
ragnarok works for me
because unlike just like you know a god

92
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.880
is coming to judge you kind of thing
it's a series finale of a tv show it

93
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.400
takes all the characters you've learned
about and it brings them all together

94
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.520
for one final big and that's um
uh it's very ragnarok is very satisfying

95
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.800
in that direction it has like a lot of
things that were like hinted in earlier

96
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.800
seasons and now they're important yeah
yeah yeah yeah um d take notes um

97
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.160
um that's david benioff and david dan
weiss or dan benioff and david

98
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.240
that goes to the [ __ ] game of
thrones guys yeah not dungeons dragon

99
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.800
lady bad um

100
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.199
watch your pearls
uh but no daenerys um ragnarok is

101
00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.199
interesting because ragnarok ends the
apocalypse of the christianity which is

102
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.680
not what is in revelations revelations
is not the apocalypse revelations is a

103
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.000
prophecy meant to symbolically represent
the liberate the pending liberation of

104
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.120
the hebrew people
yeah like the actual yeah like yeah

105
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.280
we've come to look at the book of real
the book of revelation as like an end as

106
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.680
a vision of end times but no it was yeah
the current day is like specifically

107
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.800
calling out like roman senators and the
current emperor the horror of babylon is

108
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.800
the roman empire yeah like when you
actually look into

109
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.520
into it like it's incredibly symbolic
allegorical and referential yeah john

110
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.160
the john the something one of the johns
yeah like he was writing it because he

111
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.479
had been exiled
and he was basically you know uh writing

112
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.160
it together anonymous saying he was he
was the original anonymous sending out

113
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.680
messages to people to say like hey you
know they're going to fall they're going

114
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.039
to suck and then rome did fall and he
was writing it to sort of give hope to

115
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.840
the hebrew people using a language
use a language that the romans would not

116
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.039
be
not could read but like using references

117
00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.080
that the romans romans would not be
familiar with because they felt familiar

118
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.440
with because they were so rooted in old
testament stuff yeah um which again is

119
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.520
why a lot of you know um there's like in
in the book of revelations there's a

120
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.840
bunch of callbacks to the old testament
which is none to the new testament which

121
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.000
is like why like dollar a dime like
evangelicals kind of say like oh john

122
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.120
was answering these earlier things like
no he was referencing them because the

123
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.639
romans would not be able to decipher
these references yeah they would think

124
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.840
that this is just this weird fantasy
book like no he was very specifically

125
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.199
calling of the roman empire and giving
the hebrew people

126
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.720
um
messages on how to survive the ongoing

127
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.400
invasion the ongoing occupation yeah and
that's actually one of the interesting

128
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.159
things um is that i was you know like i
said like horrified at the concept of

129
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.399
the end of the world
like literally like keeping me up all

130
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.800
night long just crying over this as a
child um

131
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.240
and me not being really willing to talk
to anyone about it

132
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.160
um still you and i have a hard time kind
of talking about that yeah um

133
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.399
my grandmother who was a former nun so
she was very she was very high into

134
00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.880
catholicism
um

135
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.519
she wasn't really super catholic i don't
think i ever saw her go to church um but

136
00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:05.920
like she knew the stories and stuff and
so she actually gave me her copy of the

137
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.279
bible
which because she was actually blind

138
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:14.720
because she um diabetes took her sight
um it was big text

139
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.480
and so it was very easy to read as like
a whenever i was a 10 year old

140
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.160
and so i read the book of revelations
and i was like

141
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.880
there's some [ __ ] there's too much
this is not realistic at all yeah and

142
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.680
like that really kind of helped me calm
down but then i was like oh but the

143
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.760
computers are going to eat us
yeah the christian apocalypse isn't in

144
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.600
revelation isn't there isn't revelations
it kind of has elements but the real

145
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.040
christian apocalypse can be seen i think
it's the book of matthew basically the

146
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.200
christ coming back to earth
um

147
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.760
uh pulling hell onto earth pulling
heaven down to earth and separating the

148
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.360
righteous from the sinners yeah um and
that's what it is

149
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.160
um
when did you know there's the whole the

150
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.480
unbaptized babies and all that stuff uh
and the interesting thing is uh out of

151
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.560
um middle eastern and euro your asian
mythology there are only two

152
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.720
uh apocalypses that go into great detail
about what happens while the world is

153
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.120
ending what happens after the world ends
and that is christianity and that's also

154
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.959
the norse mythology which uh we
referenced with um ragnarok and ragnarok

155
00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:25.040
is just so much more cinematic oh so
much more cinematic yeah like like i

156
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.640
said it's it's a series for now yeah
yeah it's the final season of an awesome

157
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.440
fantasy show um it's just the the norse
were incredibly poetic um and

158
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.600
allegorical people like there's a reason
that the eddas have been published

159
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.800
multiple times in like novel form and
become best sellers yeah specifically

160
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.959
the the poetic edda the prosaic
fictionalized historical document yeah

161
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.519
um
but yeah so that was kind of my first

162
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:55.760
exposure to fantasy
the end of the world

163
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.320
which explains a lot about my extreme
anxiety complex um my journey into

164
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.640
fantasy is a little bit more wholesome
um i can't really put a date on the

165
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.680
first when i started getting into
fantasy or my first fantasy thing

166
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.200
because like i my mom kind of pulled out
a book of all my like baby stuff and

167
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
like even as an early child i would
dictate stories for her to write down

168
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.920
and they all kind of had that element of
fantasy so it was something that i was

169
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.959
always drawn to
um

170
00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:24.720
under the concept of magic like my mom
would make fun of my mom still makes fun

171
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.959
of me because when i was a child i'd
said i'd see i said i would see um

172
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:32.160
tree fairies yeah like out in the woods
and stuff

173
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.120
um
and i was my ears were kind of pointed

174
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.480
when i was younger i was very elfish
um

175
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.399
excuse me um i mean being a change thing
would explain why i don't why i feel

176
00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:46.079
like i don't belong being a human um
that i would like to figure out how i

177
00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.120
can change back um

178
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.760
is it too late for the fae to take me
back

179
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.720
um how many trips to scotland do i have
to make for you to kidnap me

180
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.760
um onward cannot possibly be worse than
this

181
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.399
really though
um that was something that like do i

182
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:10.519
want to owe my servitude to an anonymous
capitalist corporation with a moral

183
00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:16.160
ambiguity or a morally chaotic fairy who
basically just carts me around the

184
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
magical countryside like helping
themselves that really bothered me with

185
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.959
uh
when true blood was airing like you know

186
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.560
you got your wizard not your wizards uh
you got your vampires and your

187
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.079
werewolves and your shifters and all
that kind of stuff and eventually they

188
00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.320
got to the faye
and

189
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.839
people were so bothered that they that
the fey were in the show and i'm like do

190
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:41.360
you know how [ __ ] scary those [ __ ]
are well first of all it helps like you

191
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.480
don't know like you think fairy like oh
tinkerbell

192
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.680
there's a lot more there like you know
you can the show kind of explored that

193
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.360
and unfortunately with that like and
this is on the fan this is

194
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.079
fae has a very particular meaning to it
um i'm only starting to get involved get

195
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:59.440
into chelsea mythology now uh we'll talk
about my journey through mythology but

196
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.920
like um
there's a bunch of different names they

197
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.480
could have used for the fae
um that would kind of be more

198
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.839
reminiscent of their godly warrior
status yeah um

199
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:15.920
but my journey through mythology started
with started through

200
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.440
um i was a huge space geek i loved space
i read about space all the time uh like

201
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.360
planets and stuff i used
yeah pretty much that was that was me

202
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.000
that was me i built spaceships out of
lego all the time so like you know

203
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.639
because all the planets were named after
gods i i wanted to know more about that

204
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.959
yeah um and i didn't
i'm not i'm not a [ __ ] i didn't read

205
00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:42.720
the roman ones i went straight to the
greek ones um

206
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.880
so i i don't think i dived quite as deep
as you because like i was involved in a

207
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.320
lot more concurrent fantasy
yeah and like fantasy in my life and

208
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.920
kind of consuming media and once again
like um i said this in the last version

209
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.959
like like
we didn't have a massive budget for

210
00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:00.839
books yeah uh we were kind of
hand-to-mouth for a lot of it

211
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:07.120
um do you mean libraries are free
that's true but like you i i struggled

212
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.560
with libraries yeah i don't like
libraries um i'm glad that they exist

213
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.160
and people have access to them like i
have a weird thing with libraries

214
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.120
first of all fourth of all it's not that
i need to have something collected on my

215
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.880
shelf it felt weird writing something
that did not belong to me second of all

216
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.440
i don't have to like
go to the library to get a book and then

217
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.880
i would go back and like i don't even i
didn't even like renting movies for that

218
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.760
reason like that was just too much
social that was too much unnecessary

219
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.880
social interaction oh i rented movies
all the time i would go into the video

220
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.199
store with my five dollar bill and i
would wander and wander and it was it

221
00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:46.560
was like if you rented a new release you
got like a bag of chips and the movie

222
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.199
but if you enter if you rented something
old you got like four movies in a bag of

223
00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:55.600
chips and once i discovered slasher
movies it was it was just i was leaving

224
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.920
there with armfuls so like when it comes
to libraries i always feel

225
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.199
the libraries give me this weird
imposter syndrome

226
00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.440
like like i go there and i just feel
uncomfortable because i'm like i don't

227
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.320
belong here
they're they're gonna tell me to leave

228
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.839
they're gonna figure out i don't belong
here

229
00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:15.680
um
so um mythology kind in me kind of

230
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.639
kind of um was a passive thing um i was
a bit distracted through a lot of my

231
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:25.360
kind of formative areas of high school
uh kind of trying

232
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.320
not to be a terrible person
oh by high school i'd gotten into more

233
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.519
yeah normal fantasy but i got to do that
yeah so i i struggled with reading for a

234
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:38.880
long time
um that's been an online offline thing

235
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.120
in my life um
but i i

236
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.959
towards high school i did kind of dive
into north norse mythology that's kind

237
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:50.480
of when we started having reliable
internet access yeah i started to go on

238
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.440
these like wikipedia spirals back when
wikipedia was young um

239
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.320
and so that's kind of what the world was
and yeah

240
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.000
and um i i read the aragon series and i
think that might have also hurt my love

241
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.600
for fantasy i when it came to aragon i
had that was after i read i had started

242
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.959
reading harry potter
uh i started reading harry potter in the

243
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:17.759
seventh grade so i was 12 years old when
i started reading it um

244
00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:21.199
i read it completely out of order i did
uh prisoner of azkaban chamber of

245
00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:25.440
secrets goblet of fire and then
uh philosopher's stone

246
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.959
um because i was like i don't need to
read philosopher's stone i saw the movie

247
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:31.600
um
i also read lord of the rings the hobbit

248
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.360
the silmarillion i still haven't read a
lord of the rings i tried to and then i

249
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.920
got discouraged and i need to i every
now and then every now and then

250
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.720
my um advice for anyone who wants to
read lord of the rings is skip the first

251
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.800
chapter that was what i did wrong yeah
because i kept tr i read that thing like

252
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.920
i couldn't figure out what was going on
so i reread it like seven times and i i

253
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.720
just gave up yeah because there's a
ridiculous amount of stuff in there

254
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.360
that's not necessary i don't need to
know that much information about hobbits

255
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.880
hobbits not off the bat
but so i had you know gotten into lord

256
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:07.120
of the rings and harry potter and
then i tr and i was reading a lot of

257
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.400
uh other kinds of fantasy like anne rice
novels and things like that um

258
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.520
gotten into horror fantasy dracula
oh i did read dracula yeah i um i did

259
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.160
stuff like that that was fun and then i
tried and i read the narnia books uh and

260
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.959
then i tried everyone i knew
was reading aragon

261
00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.840
and i was like okay i'll go read aragon
so i went to the bookstore and i bought

262
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.320
it
and i got like maybe 50 pages into it

263
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.600
and i was like what is this drivel
like after after like being a 13 year

264
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.840
old at this point
having read like lord of the rings

265
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.160
well like fantasy yeah yes but like
fantasy-wise having read lord of the

266
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.240
rings reading aragon was like what is
this like what was this baby first

267
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.039
fantasy you know necessarily didn't mean
a whole lot to me but it wasn't until i

268
00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:59.919
realized that there was not a single
original thought in those books that i

269
00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:02.480
was like
which makes sense because he was writing

270
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.840
them when he was like 16.
yeah i was gonna say when he was in the

271
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.400
womb i mean like he's never really he
apparently um and multiple people have

272
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.720
backed this up um
doesn't have really much humility about

273
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.200
that
and even though he was 16 he's like

274
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.480
because every person i've met who's an
author is like yeah i'm really glad that

275
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.600
the stuff i wrote when i was 16 will
never see the light of day again yeah

276
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.440
he's like abundantly proud of it um
like to the point where he hasn't

277
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.679
written a single [ __ ] book since then
he has has he yeah what

278
00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.640
i forget what it's called but it came
out recently okay okay that was an

279
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.039
elaboration on
the world of aragon

280
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:43.760
it was like no i think he wrote
something that wasn't aragon basically

281
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.039
okay i i might be wrong but i i'm pretty
i might be wrong too but like you know

282
00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:51.440
like he just had apparently like a
really smug kind of take to it he like

283
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.760
you know like when a lot of authors get
interviews they're like yeah i really

284
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.559
like to thank my fans i you know i do
everything for them like he didn't

285
00:18:56.559 --> 00:19:02.000
really kind of have that yeah um
excuse me um and said they kind of did

286
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.960
like he kind of had that came across as
like yeah i did it myself

287
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.840
i did this and it's like no your parents
work for the publisher

288
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.919
um
he might have changed since then who

289
00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:15.039
knows everyone was a bit of a snot his
parents were agents

290
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:18.000
either they were agents or editors
okay

291
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.600
uh eknoff uh the um

292
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.240
uh yeah i pronounced it nop for the
longest time i was like the k must be

293
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.400
silent but apparently it's not alfred a
kanop started the publishing company it

294
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.240
must be german since german
but that's that that was also the

295
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.480
publisher that did anne rice
so um

296
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.799
aragon was kind of my last real kind of
venture into

297
00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:45.679
like children's fantasy and then i
decided i had enough of this and then i

298
00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:50.320
started treating salman rushdie
um it's quite a jump quite a joke from

299
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.600
aragon salman rushdie i did enjoy it i i
like salman rushdie's prosaic almost

300
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.160
poetic wrote writing style he's very um
flowery which i'm sure

301
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.320
you hate about you hate that i read that
um it doesn't help

302
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.480
when we're editing your books yeah
um

303
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.080
so like throughout there like mythology
and fantasy always had like meaning to

304
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.840
me i'm very i like being connected to
nature i like

305
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.679
you know being connected to the world if
i had any friends in that little town

306
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:25.200
that i was in i probably would have been
involved in witchcraft much earlier than

307
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.760
i
i'm getting into now

308
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:34.400
um even though i consider myself a weird
mix of taoist and pagan and stuff yeah

309
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.799
um
so

310
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.799
when it comes like i also did read harry
potter too yeah you know i think

311
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:45.280
everybody read harry potter almost
everyone yeah

312
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.679
um the cool kids kidding um
like i eventually got into a lot more

313
00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:56.080
fantasy just like
diving into

314
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.840
it was actually in my 20s that i really
got into fantasy reading you know song

315
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.120
of ice and fire and the kingkiller
chronicles and um the shannara

316
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.640
chronicles from terry brooks
um

317
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.559
like all of that just kind of diving
into i gave the kingkiller chronicles

318
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:18.320
this college try yeah
um and just diving into a lot more

319
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.440
fantasy but like
fantasy

320
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.120
i don't want to say fantasy is not like
i am interested in fantasy i really

321
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.039
enjoy well well-written fantasy but i
find it hard to get into a lot of

322
00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:38.559
fantasy because
there's an expectation with fantasy

323
00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:43.120
novels
that this shit's gonna go

324
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.559
yeah and on
like if it's like i find a book that i'm

325
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:49.840
like oh this seems interesting it's like
oh it's a trilogy i'm like oh

326
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.880
cool but when it's like oh here's a book
like you know the eye of the world and

327
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.640
it's like oh there's a could there's 18
books that have to that i have to read

328
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.039
afterwards and they're all a thousand
pages

329
00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:04.640
i'm like you know actually
um

330
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.960
wikipedia is a thing so what and i can
read a synopsis what's a good length

331
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.200
because you know like in any one of
those books there might be a dud

332
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.320
i mean the 18 books there might be yeah
and that's the problem that's a thousand

333
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.480
page dud that's like that's like trying
to get rid of the feast of prose again

334
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.000
yeah or get through the fees for crows
again so like you know there is a point

335
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.360
where like a series is optimal i get
that some people just like reading like

336
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.320
on and on and on and on but like you
know like

337
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.280
um some of us are a little bit more
sensitive to qualitative changes um and

338
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.559
that's not sort of saying like oh we
only look for good authors it's like no

339
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:42.559
like even good authors have their off
days oh they all have a dog yeah i mean

340
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:46.400
like i still haven't managed to read
tale of the body thief by anne rice like

341
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.480
i've i just it's book for the vampire
chronicles i have not managed to read it

342
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.200
yeah like and and so like there's gonna
be even though it's a lot of people's

343
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.200
favorite book yeah um and so like you
know i'm not sort of ragging against

344
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.559
authors i'm not sort of like putting
myself on this whitey tweety like like i

345
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:03.600
only like literature

346
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.559
darling
um but like

347
00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:13.360
so so like some people kind of can't
really jive with things that like

348
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.760
struggle to kind of like be
uh kind of hit the flow of the what what

349
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.480
drew to the series in the first place
yeah so

350
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.000
it's really hard to kind of get in get
into a series that's that long because

351
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.720
there's the anxiety of like what if
there's one of those books and now

352
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.280
there's like
the two fantasy series that i was like

353
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.880
i am enjoying this we're a song of ice
and fire and kill king killer chronicles

354
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.240
both of which
it's been a [ __ ]

355
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.679
decade
since the last book came out and the

356
00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:47.279
authors just keep saying i'm working on
it i'm working on it

357
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:51.440
i'm working on it
i'm working on it i started over

358
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.159
i'm and it's like oh my christ on a
cross can you please give us some deets

359
00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.840
how's it going on a scale of one to ten
how complete is it and you know there

360
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.799
are lots and lots of people who say you
know you can't force creativity and

361
00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.960
stuff um
i am of the opinion since i have you

362
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.760
know
i i have gone to film school i have gone

363
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.640
to business school i understand
contracts uh you signed a contract

364
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.000
and you need to if you're having trouble
writing it

365
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.960
get over it but like here's the other
thing that i think i call [ __ ]

366
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.760
because i feel like there's there's a
there's there's a grace period where

367
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.960
it's like i'm having a hard time and
it's like

368
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.120
it takes an extra two years to get the
book out it's like that's understandable

369
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.840
it's a lot of work to write a book a
decade yeah and here's the thing

370
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.120
this is the
novel writing is the only profession

371
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.840
where that happens

372
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.039
it's i don't think it's the only
profession where it happens but i think

373
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.760
it's the only profession where your ass
doesn't get fired for it happening oh

374
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.960
yeah that's true
um because like you know it's or maybe

375
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.640
like painting
yeah there are hiatuses there and like

376
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.520
you know there's a difference between a
hiatus and like hey i'm promising new

377
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.640
material but i am not delivering yeah
excuse me uh that that does not fly in

378
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.000
hollywood
no um not even if you're getting like

379
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
paid two million dollars to write show
girls like you keep you keep going you

380
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.720
don't stop like well yeah like your
career your career hinges on momentum

381
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.039
coming from you know business school and
film school in the film industry and and

382
00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:23.520
you know like contracts and stuff like
that

383
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.440
it's it's very much like okay you have
this much money to do this

384
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.840
and you need it done by this day because
if it's not done by this day we're

385
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.279
taking it from you but just like you
know you don't get like the right the

386
00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:38.080
you know the the great writers who are
like i've been working on a script like

387
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.919
the last five years it's just not really
flowing it'll get there eventually it's

388
00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:46.000
like no a movie's trick like someone
writes a movie script in an afternoon

389
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.919
sometimes like yeah
uh well not an afternoon i know like the

390
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:55.440
the the fastest one that i like the
there was um kevin williamson did the

391
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.600
outline for scream in a weekend
and wrote it in six weeks

392
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.520
and that's like the
of a fast turnaround

393
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.120
um and then got half a million dollars
for it

394
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.960
good for him
very good for him hooray for the gays

395
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.480
hooray for the gays yeah
yeah yeah yeah there you go

396
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:22.880
right inflection um
so you know you can't even yas correctly

397
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.640
yes so what time what are we at for time
um

398
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.279
27 minutes 27 minutes
um okay so

399
00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:36.640
like as i've gotten older i have become
much more involved with mythology than i

400
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.760
have been
i'm starting to branch out into

401
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.440
celtic mythology um

402
00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:48.480
i don't actually have any irish roots
but you know celtic refers to a very

403
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.679
large um group of people across uh what
is modern day france and also the

404
00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:57.200
british isles all of them why don't you
just go buy a clotter ring you fake

405
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.559
[ __ ]
what a clatter ring

406
00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:07.279
it's it's a it's a celtic symbol oh on a
ring oh i don't do rings um well

407
00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:12.080
there's a lot of people who are like i'm
sure i have celtic heritage it's like

408
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.320
you don't i i
scottish celtic that's my that's where

409
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.799
my
celtic heritage is uh most of my

410
00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:24.720
heritage is actually central european
uh wait is celtic irish or scottish

411
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.039
there is celtic irish and celtic
scottish okay keep in mind that scotland

412
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:34.480
uh historically might be mistaken was
settled by irish um

413
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.080
by irish people who went north to the
northern part of the island

414
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.559
um and then just because
scotland has a lot of in his bodybuild

415
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:45.200
territory they couldn't really get
pushed out

416
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.120
not even by the romans
um

417
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.000
because i have um celtic i'm kind of a
mix of celtic and um

418
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.960
slavic which slavic mythology that's
awry very interesting that's a ride and

419
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.080
i want to get involved interested in
that because the celtic mythology unlike

420
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.960
a lot of other pagan uh communities in
europe did commit human sacrifice yeah

421
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.520
so that's really really interesting um
also and you know you may think like oh

422
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.520
the druids did human sacrifice and stuff
uh that is untrue uh that was propaganda

423
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.240
spread by julius caesar during rome's
con conquest of gaelia yeah

424
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.000
um so yeah like i love the
intersectionality of mythology and

425
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.480
history
um

426
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.799
the recent kind of foyer into mythology
is actually fairly greek and roman

427
00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:36.000
centric again yeah i've circled around
back to that

428
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.600
uh and i'm finding lots of very
interesting tidbits of stuff that i

429
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.720
didn't notice there before because
you're actually writing two books that

430
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.840
take
like draw from that the draft yeah

431
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.559
one of them is a you know specifically
high fantasy thing set in rome ancient

432
00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:54.480
rome ancient rome um
uh

433
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.760
bc uh
a.d yeah a

434
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.000
uh about 708 i think the bookstore it's
not a d anymore i think it's like it's

435
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.520
uh common era ce common era yeah which i
don't understand why we can't just keep

436
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.720
the latin it doesn't mean before christ
yeah

437
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.720
um

438
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.960
the gregorian calendar psy um in rome
they actually gauged their year most

439
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.720
people didn't gauge the years most
people didn't give a [ __ ] yeah but in

440
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.399
other official documentation it was um
based on the founding of the city um

441
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:32.320
and you know you learned that rome
as an empire or kingdom and then empire

442
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.919
existed for about 2 000 years that's
wild

443
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:40.320
that's crazy
like a singular government system

444
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.000
existing for 2000 years that's insane
yeah because i i think

445
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.760
when we think of ancient rome we kind of
think like oh it fell two thousand years

446
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.760
ago yeah it actually fell like
1500 years ago

447
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.320
like it was around for a while it was
around it was rome was falling longer

448
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.240
than america has been around that's much
true that is much true and that bothers

449
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.320
me about discussions around it's like oh
well rome fell where and we will not and

450
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.320
it's like rome had 2 000 years yeah like
you know like um

451
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.440
i don't think even like uh arabian uh
cultures existed like persia existed for

452
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.200
that long uh uninterrupted yeah um
because you know when it came to um the

453
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.080
city that is now

454
00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:30.559
istanbul
um that very very ancient city

455
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:36.159
um has swapped hands many many times
yeah um and even though it can be seen

456
00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:41.200
as this as the same culture the name and
the name and the power holders of that

457
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.279
society have swapped over you know very
repeatedly

458
00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:49.279
um
uh fascinating city i've always wanted

459
00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:54.559
to go there um
so yeah like i um

460
00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:58.240
there's so many like weird little
tidbitty things that aren't kind of like

461
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.360
mainstay like greek stories that are
just really really cool that

462
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.440
characterize the gods that expand the
mythology and sort of depict the

463
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.320
relationship between humanity and these
gods and yet people kind of cling to the

464
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.080
the popular ones i think and kind of
really stick on those ones but um and

465
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.799
this is something that hades did really
well as they kind of referenced the game

466
00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:20.720
ladies the game hades yeah uh ref they
referenced the smaller stories that were

467
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.360
really really interesting yeah um
for instance my fixation around the god

468
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.120
pan kind of
uh was cemented when i learned that he

469
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.799
was one of two canonical gods to die in
greek mythology yeah um i really would

470
00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:38.320
like to do more reading about that
specifically because um that's um

471
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.159
referencing a story in real life where a
trail a sailor was sailing from greek to

472
00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:46.080
uh the italian peninsula and he heard a
great voice from across the ocean and

473
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.440
say uh tell everyone the great god pan
is dead yeah um

474
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.000
i just think that's really interesting
it's a very poetic

475
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.320
especially because like the greek gods
unlike the norse gods were immortal they

476
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.880
could not die yeah
um and then you have like this canonical

477
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.880
death and pan was one of the big ones
yeah um probably b-tier in terms of just

478
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.600
like yeah but it wasn't like
heracles where you have you know uh he

479
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.880
wasn't like sylvanas he wasn't like um
the the lesser known like aristeas he

480
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.080
wasn't like one of the lesser known
local ones he was like and he wasn't

481
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.880
like a mixed god human kind of thing
yeah he was he was a god god i mean he

482
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.559
was a goat god but
um

483
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:35.600
that that was really really interesting
to me

484
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.519
uh so why do you think
fantasy has such a grasp on the stuff

485
00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:44.960
that you write
um

486
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.880
probably is the stain from react for
reality

487
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.320
like i
i i think slice of life stuff can be

488
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.840
kind of boring yeah like i i'm not
really interested in the slice of life

489
00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.159
because it's the slice of someone else's
life that's sort of i feel like a lot of

490
00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:04.480
not a fan of mrs dolloway
actually i don't mind virginia woolf

491
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.039
like i can read older stuff um it's
about prose and flow for me yeah what i

492
00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:14.399
write what i read um i do like that that
said the virginia wolf i did read was uh

493
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:18.000
orlando which is you know magic realism
yeah that's not um

494
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.600
that's not me have you read mrs dolloway
uh it's about a woman planning planning

495
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.720
a party
isn't her husband at a war or something

496
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.080
i forget
anyway it's very much just a day in the

497
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.559
life of a woman kind of i mean but it's
virginia woolf it must be shady as [ __ ]

498
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:36.799
like i can't imagine there isn't shade
in there that woman was so shady

499
00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:39.799
um

500
00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:43.760
but like so fantasy kind of occupies a
lot of the space of what i want to

501
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.039
develop because like i i guess on a
level i either believe it exists or i

502
00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:54.080
want it to exist yeah um so why doesn't
fantasy really factor into a lot of what

503
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.559
you write and what you plan i don't know
it's it's weird most because you know

504
00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:01.919
lord of the rings lower backwards and
forth yeah like i've

505
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:04.880
actually read the silmarillion multiple
times

506
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.280
um
i don't know why it doesn't i i

507
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.960
i'm much more grounded in the stuff that
i write

508
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.240
um
even like the movies that i'm working on

509
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.359
with telos now
like they're all

510
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:25.520
realistic they could all happen do you
think you have this subliminal tug in

511
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.839
the back of your mind where fantasy is
somehow lesser than or somehow

512
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:33.919
diminished i don't think so because
there are stories there are fantasy

513
00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:37.440
stories i want to tell there's this
grand science fiction epic that i want

514
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.200
to tell
um

515
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.399
there's this
um

516
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:46.480
fantasy
story that i have been working on for

517
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.560
years that i that i want to tell there's
fantasy ideas that pop up for movies

518
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.560
that i want to do um
i think it's

519
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.000
that
i feel more comfortable

520
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.119
with
realism

521
00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.760
and
because i'm drawing from things that

522
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.359
really exist
whereas

523
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:13.839
when doing fantasy
i see yeah and i think looking at it

524
00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:18.720
from a pragmatic point of view
the fantasy market is kind for like

525
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.760
books is very
saturated yeah and one thing if i if i

526
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.280
can say is like i feel like that's uh
one thing that you kind of get snagged

527
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.200
on when you're developing your own
content is you start to obsess about the

528
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.880
details like how am i going to publish
this what's the demographic and then

529
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.160
like that that's what happens when i
went to school for marketing yeah and

530
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.119
like just talking and i don't you could
you don't you don't need this creative

531
00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.240
process but my creative process is the
more i think about that the more i think

532
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.000
about okay i need to make sure this
chapter isn't too long i'm behind on

533
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
pacing i need to keep i need to get
things picked up um

534
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.839
i need to make sure that this is content
geared towards this specific target

535
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:59.839
people that stops me from writing
because it stops being fun it stops

536
00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:03.440
being interesting it starts being a job
and that makes me not want to do it yeah

537
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.480
um
some people that's how they function

538
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.280
they need tart they need specific
targets they need to go for them and

539
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.200
that's why a lot of the great writers
offering writing advice say like there's

540
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.079
not really anything i can offer you i
can tell you how i do it but i'm not

541
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:18.400
going to tell you to do it you're i'm
going to i'm not going to tell you to do

542
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.520
it this way yeah because they realize
that you know like if every writer is

543
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.560
the same then every book's the same and
that's absolutely not what needs to

544
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.400
happen as much as publishing would like
that to happen yeah um

545
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:34.640
uh because one of my like
it's weird because like i don't write a

546
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:40.320
whole lot of fantasy but i
prefer reading fantasy yeah like not

547
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.520
necessarily high fantasy that's like 18
books long

548
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.720
wheel of time uh i love magic realism
that's what it typically when you have

549
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.119
like kind of um
uh for instance it's a catwoman getting

550
00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:56.480
resurrected in batman returns oh that's
not even what i'm talking about though

551
00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.400
okay like i'm like literally you know
like the prince is in a different castle

552
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.280
kind of okay like um
you know so adventure fantasy yeah like

553
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.920
i love adventure fantasy
um and like my favorite book series is

554
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.440
series this is of all time are
the lord of the rings

555
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.599
the vampire chronicles
and the dark tower yeah and they're all

556
00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:22.800
fantasy
um uh stephen king related right

557
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.359
multiverse of madness before
marvel did yes he did

558
00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:30.160
and he did it better though that's not
hard to do

559
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:35.119
the bar is low
but like the i i just

560
00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:40.400
i i lucked into the dark tower because i
read the gunslinger which is book one

561
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.480
and then
i read the drawing of the three which is

562
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.119
book two
and then stephen king announced that he

563
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:51.280
was doing books um for our five six and
seven

564
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.720
uh because it had been like a decade
since he has put it since he'd published

565
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.880
one
uh because he'd gotten into the car

566
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.160
accident was like you know who knows how
much time i actually have left so i want

567
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.359
to finish this story
um

568
00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:07.200
and so i kind of lucked into starting
the series just as he was publishing out

569
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.200
the new books oh that's great uh at the
rate he publishes books like yeah i

570
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.079
think like the last three books which
are

571
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:18.560
uh like 750 pages 500 pages and a
thousand pages

572
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.680
in a year and a half nice um
he was just churning them out

573
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.359
and there's um the eye through the
keyhole is the eighth book um but it's

574
00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:36.640
kind of like an offshoot adventure um
but i dove deep into the dark tower and

575
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.760
just kind of became obsessed with it and
really loved it that's a book that's a

576
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.440
fantasy series i really want to get
invested in because it seems

577
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.040
i love reality [ __ ] yeah so
and there's like dimensional travel and

578
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.520
there's science there's a bit of science
fiction in there there's like high

579
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.440
fantasy like the big villain is more
dread like it's

580
00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.079
like there's all sorts of like really
interesting fun stuff in there um

581
00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:04.320
obviously western is also in there
um

582
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.119
and so like
my relationship with fantasy is

583
00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:12.560
i have a very healthy respect for
fantasy

584
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.280
um and i don't think that it's that it
that i feel when i'm writing that i feel

585
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.640
like it's beneath me i feel like i'm
beneath it

586
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.720
that i can't see like with me like i
talk about you about that creating an

587
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.920
entire world is beyond me yeah because
um this is interesting um because like

588
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.560
i've talked about you and like there are
some times that i read something like

589
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.240
wow i really wish i could write a book
like this and you're like you don't have

590
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.920
to you write your books i'm like yeah
but this is so perfect

591
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.760
and i just get like um somebody some new
gaming stuff for just he has this

592
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.920
restraint when it comes to depicting his
magic that i don't have i much more

593
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:54.079
prefer to explore the world yeah um
uh some other books sometimes like you

594
00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:58.000
know like every time there's like cutesy
romance young adult romances that sell

595
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.480
everyone like i really wish i could
write that

596
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:06.240
and it's
i just can't it's not me yeah um

597
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.520
how'd we get on that
i lost my train of thought

598
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.760
um no no no okay yeah yeah with fantasy
like i um

599
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.200
i'm not comfortable writing reality
because i feel like i will be called out

600
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.480
for not knowing what the [ __ ] i'm
talking about yeah uh for missing a

601
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.480
detail doing something wrong
um i i have those anxieties about the

602
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.040
avalon night series um especially when
it comes to sport ball stuff um but like

603
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.400
you
have never been to san francisco yeah

604
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.000
but at this point you could probably
find your way around san francisco just

605
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.319
from writing that book yeah i
had uh google maps open constantly

606
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:49.440
yeah sort of just going through these
things

607
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.400
um
and kind of laying things out kind of

608
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.920
superimposing like the areas that it's
different in this world because

609
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.640
superheroes exist
um

610
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:03.359
i feel much better taking creative
licenses with reality because i'm less

611
00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:07.680
familiar with reality than what's in my
own imagination yeah because in like a

612
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.680
fantasy world that i create um or you
know a real world that i recreate with

613
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.720
fantasy in it
i can control that i have more control

614
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.599
over that so i know what is correct and
what's incorrect um i know the systems

615
00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:24.160
of how magic and science fiction and
whatever work in this world um

616
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.520
which leads me to something else i want
to talk about systems of magic in

617
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.200
fiction
uh yeah like soft magic hardware soft

618
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.200
magic hard magic what works well what
work doesn't you mentioned harry potter

619
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.240
i'd like to start there because
that's kind of like the most obvious

620
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.079
magic because it's literally casting
spells yeah but at the same time how

621
00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:48.720
well is it actualized in the first seven
books

622
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.319
well there are only seven books i mean
like outside of any other media that's

623
00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:55.200
been introduced like in the for in the
seven books

624
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.240
how well does it act does it actually
get actualized because there are a lot

625
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.000
of really weird things in that world
where like i i i kind of was uh came up

626
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.119
in writing with the explaining the
understanding like when you make a

627
00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:12.640
system of magic the system of magic
needs to have rules and you cannot break

628
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.560
these rules because you're already
breaking reality with them and yeah the

629
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.640
way i kind of always looked at it and i
might be wrong she who must not be named

630
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:25.760
might disagree with me on most things
actually yeah um but

631
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.000
i always kind of looked at the magic in
those books as language based because

632
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.920
whenever you cast a spell and you said
the wrong

633
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.079
uh
in you

634
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:40.240
pronounce something wrong or the wrong
you put the emphasis on the wrong

635
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.000
syllable something like that the spell
would go awry yeah and so i always kind

636
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.440
of thought it was very language based
yeah which didn't make sense to me in

637
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.040
the movies when people could start
casting spells without speaking yeah and

638
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.720
like that's not for visual effect but
sure but with like i found i feel like

639
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.160
because in the movies they didn't want
to have that anime thing where you know

640
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.160
you announce your attack yeah
i hate that

641
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.079
um
and like i and that that did kind of

642
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:09.760
seem a bit stupid to me in the book
because it was like a italicized

643
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.200
vlatinized word with an explanation
point oh counterspell uh they do a

644
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.800
stream connect
um

645
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.480
uh is daniel radcliffe's face in the
first fourth movie when he's doing that

646
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.000
that is a face um
oh in the

647
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.599
graveyard the graveyard i
the harry potter books are like three

648
00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:36.800
different series meant for three
different age ranges

649
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.200
and each one is des and each subsequent
one is desperately trying to retcon the

650
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.280
earlier ones
um yeah it's kind of book one and two

651
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.560
and then three four five and then six
and seven yeah and they are

652
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.800
there are areas where magic is so
incredibly broken for instance the

653
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.800
biggest one i don't like is the killing
curse of attica davera it's like

654
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.480
so it cannot be countered it cannot be
countered freaking fantastic beast

655
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.359
movies
it cannot be countered it cannot be

656
00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:09.680
blocked
and it kills you instantly and i'm like

657
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.400
the human body is a very complex thing
and if one thing goes wrong you could

658
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.000
die
you do not need a killing curse yeah you

659
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.160
do not need a killing curse you you
could have a i'm sending a magical spear

660
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.760
through your chest curse yeah like and
you can also have it so that it's

661
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.000
countered you could have it so that
certain spells are very difficult to be

662
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.079
countered but it seems too absolute
especially in a nation which just

663
00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:37.920
already banned guns that that that that
it seemed like if you want to have a

664
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.160
vatican ever in american schools
like i feel like that's more of a thing

665
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.920
because of like mass shootings and stuff
um well it's the whole it's the

666
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.400
unforgivable curse yeah the killings
curse the torture the

667
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.000
uh torture curse and the control curse
yeah like they're the unforgivable

668
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.280
curses um
[Music]

669
00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.880
and so and in the movies especially in
the books especially some cur some

670
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.160
spells had visual effect like a beam
other spells didn't in the movies it's a

671
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.599
mess yeah um
in the books it makes a little more

672
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.760
sense
because the only person that can

673
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.280
actually
um

674
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.520
uh

675
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.040
go against the avada cadaver curse is
harry

676
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.000
and that's specifically because
voldemort can't kill him

677
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.240
um or i forget the rules i haven't read
it power of love james yeah the power of

678
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.119
love uh the power of friendship um
a mother's love

679
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:39.440
but yeah harry potter is a very baby's
first magic system yeah but then it

680
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.280
tries not to be and i think that's where
the problem started to arrive is when

681
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.760
they started to match your eyes and
started trying to explain all these

682
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.560
things
also the random teleporting what's that

683
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.119
called again not flu not whooping that's
fruit powder flu powder blue powder the

684
00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:58.160
uh no the operating oh you can pretty
much just operate anywhere in the world

685
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.640
yeah like it's like no big deal it's
like that that's kind of it

686
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.480
it's kind of dumb it removes the other
methods of transportation as a viable

687
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.560
means of like moving and it once again
it's kind of asking like why did you

688
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.119
create flu powder when you can just
report keys it's like oh because uh you

689
00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:18.079
need uh young young people can't do it
so we need to do it for young people

690
00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:22.000
it's like okay but why do you have port
why do you have older people using port

691
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.359
keys in the fourth book then yeah if
someone's touching you while you're

692
00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:30.240
operating they can go it with you even
if they're young so yeah the rules her

693
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.160
rules are dumb and it is like as i much
prefer the magic system in lord of the

694
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:42.240
rings yes which is like gandalf and
saruman use a little bit of magic um

695
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.119
gandalf shoots some light beams it seems
to be

696
00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:49.359
mostly like magic yeah happened
thousands of years ago yeah the magic

697
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:52.880
was more
alchemy and not just that but the magic

698
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.400
is connected to the world to the earth
so the the the caster needs to

699
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.680
call upon their connection to the the
land yeah like frodo you can't learn

700
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.680
magic because he doesn't have that
connection like spirits can use magic

701
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.160
yeah and elves okay well elves are like
spiritual things but like the maya

702
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.680
spirits and stuff like that dwarves
cannot because they do not have a

703
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.480
connection to magic because they're
obsessed with well to the world because

704
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.119
they're obsessed with wealth well
they're ex

705
00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:25.440
it's not necessarily wealth it's more
that they they

706
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.440
are mining into the world they are
taking from the world and so they can't

707
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.480
ask the world yeah for you know they
don't they don't have a rapport yeah

708
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.520
yeah because it's just a resource to
them

709
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.960
yeah whereas like the nas ghoul have
magic because like like i said in the

710
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.960
last episode about the jedi versus the
sith they oppose the world so they draw

711
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.599
magic from outside of it and use it to
subjugate yeah if i'm you correct me if

712
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:54.559
i'm wrong the nazca really don't use
magic very much um their magic really

713
00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:58.960
emanates from their rings
um which again is more alchemy based

714
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.520
yeah um
and yeah like that is a big thing in

715
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.839
like a lot of older magic too is like um
it's we look at magic now like you know

716
00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:09.839
like oh the members of the party the
wizard throws this fireball like the way

717
00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:13.920
magic has been throughout history um has
been like

718
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.160
um

719
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.200
magic and witchcraft takes time
preparation and familiarity yeah uh

720
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.920
witchcraft specifically is about being
connected to a specific local region

721
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.079
and having dominion over that
um whereas other areas of magic are

722
00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:35.599
about you know likely lengthy rituals uh
calling upon spirits and powers um and

723
00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:39.119
that takes time and it's not something
you can do in a pinch yeah um so like

724
00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:44.240
you're all if someone gets a hold of you
you're [ __ ] yeah um

725
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.839
so yeah
yeah that there's actual like casting

726
00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:52.400
involved that's not just saying a word
and something comes out of your fingers

727
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.880
yeah uh it's not the harry potter system
which is basically just

728
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.400
special guns
uh i i like the witcher's system of

729
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.760
magic i've read some of the witcher
books um

730
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.160
i like i like that system of magic a lot
because it's uh it's kept deliberately

731
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.920
vague it's kept academic
um and at the same time it's like only

732
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.319
search everyone can technically use
magic but certain people have aptitude

733
00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:20.640
that will let them use more complex
spells and incantations yeah like i

734
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.040
love the magic system in a song of ice
and fire

735
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.720
because it is very very few people can
use magic very very it's ritual based

736
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.160
it's just almost exclusively around
doing rituals

737
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.200
it's religious
yeah you are asking a god to do

738
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.920
something for you if someone got the red
woman against a against a wall with a

739
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.000
hand to her throat she's she's useless
yeah but if she has the time to prepare

740
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.680
a spell she can assassinate someone from
halfway across the continent the shadow

741
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.360
baby thing shadow baby
um kill your gaze um

742
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.079
[Music]
poor ramsay you're so attractive

743
00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:02.480
friendly renly he was so hot yeah ramsay
was not the attractive one

744
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.599
ramsay but
i don't know

745
00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:09.599
i mean
personality personality goes a long way

746
00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:14.079
jake like not personality wise but i
mean i wouldn't kick him at a bit

747
00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:18.000
the actor is very attractive yeah wasn't
he not attractive in the book depicted

748
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.119
as being like oh yeah he's like gross in
the book yeah yeah yeah

749
00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:25.040
um
but you know they want to have that kill

750
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.119
killing stalking vibe so yeah
[Laughter]

751
00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:34.720
why did nobody ship them i'm sure people
did i know people did

752
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.040
ramsay and theon
uh i really like it when they mix

753
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.200
science fiction and fantasy
kind of have either explicit magic

754
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.040
system in space
or star wars something

755
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.520
i wouldn't say that's a magic system
that's super powers

756
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.040
okay
um and and i i and you're allowed to

757
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.839
disagree with me because my distinction
in my head is very vague but i mean like

758
00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:05.280
a magic system is like have like oracles
and like learn some more tunes yeah yeah

759
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.520
yeah uh that that's the magic system
with the benny jesuit yeah whereas uh

760
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:14.559
star wars is super powers yeah yeah it
is yeah yeah um

761
00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:19.359
still both fantasies yeah um but yeah
but oddly

762
00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:24.800
dune has more
magic than star wars but is considered

763
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.359
harder fantasy than star wars i wouldn't
disagree because a lot of the technology

764
00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:33.119
and star wars are harder science fiction
than star wars oh yeah absolutely star

765
00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:37.119
wars is much more fantasy than dunas
yeah because star wars has like

766
00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:41.280
superpowers if the millennium falcon has
a dragon or a noble steed then they're

767
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.920
writing it into battle yeah um sort of
thing luke skywalker's x-wing is a horse

768
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.160
yeah um
they're literally knights jedi knights

769
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.359
um and i it's very arthurian yeah i i
still would love to read through dune it

770
00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:58.079
seems like a really interesting story i
hate that it takes place on a desert

771
00:51:58.079 --> 00:52:01.599
planet and that's it um
i mean you do

772
00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:05.680
bounce around a bit as the i know i know
because they terraform doing it some at

773
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.160
one point where it's not a desert
anymore

774
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.920
um i it's like the thing i feel about
doing with that is like it's mostly

775
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.720
verse of madness with me like why you
want to make a science fiction a space

776
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.520
hopping science fiction thing and only
have it on one planet why do you want to

777
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.359
travel across the multiverse if you only
go to two like well because it's not a

778
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:24.640
space hopping science fiction thing it's
really

779
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.760
kind like an algorithm exploration
allegorical exploration of the

780
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.680
subjugation of the middle east by um
you know

781
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.839
western
basically yeah and kind of

782
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:41.920
a a look at the power struggles of
the white men

783
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.720
above the yeah the people of color who
they are subjugating even if it's like

784
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.559
the nice white man he's still
subjugating them yeah yeah

785
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:54.079
and then there's they're not nice
it's subjugation subjugation with a

786
00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:57.920
smile yeah
baron harkin who

787
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:03.440
kills and rapes children little boys
he's the bad one they represent the

788
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.640
russians i guess a bad one
um

789
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.040
well yeah harkenan is a
they i i'm pretty i think they the the

790
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.680
harkenings are very
russian coded like when you read the the

791
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.359
especially the first book the harkenings
don't really aren't that important going

792
00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:22.720
forward but
they're uh they're very important in the

793
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.400
prequel books written by his son but
they're not very important for the

794
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.680
um
the actual dune series

795
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.640
as much as
you know duncan idaho

796
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:38.800
duncan idaho uh the naming convention in
that story um

797
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.040
one thing i really really love is
ambiguous fantasy

798
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.200
not really sure whether what would that
be uh catwoman getting resurrected like

799
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.160
i said in the video okay she's not
really sure whether she got resurrected

800
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.920
by cat magic or if she just survived
with severe head trauma

801
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.680
um but you know she does go through nine
la eight lives yeah um

802
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.440
uh what's a ghost of tsushima it's not
really clear whether there's actual

803
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.559
magic involved in there um or these by
being guided by the gods i i love that

804
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:14.480
yeah uh because i i always default to
yes it's magic uh because i love

805
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.839
you know magic existing in very urban uh
kind of ways ways that are very

806
00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:22.800
difficult to discern and that we would
not

807
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.040
accept his magic because it's not a
wizard throwing fireballs yeah but you

808
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.480
know like the world having its own kind
of system of magic that's very subtle

809
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.920
and difficult to tap into
yeah that's one of the reasons i loved

810
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.559
final fantasy 10
um

811
00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:38.720
because although you know there's
there's

812
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.559
magic mana attacks you know like
fireball lightning bolt stuff like that

813
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:48.720
the actual magic system in the the
cannon of the game with uh yuna and

814
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.280
stuff like that is very much asking the
spirits of the planet

815
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.880
to assist you
um

816
00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.280
asking the spirits of the planet to heal
and and things like that it's it's much

817
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.000
more nature based
than

818
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.839
um you know just you know wizard throws
his fireball yeah firewall 10 pf

819
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:14.640
pp
uh hp no no

820
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:20.240
ability points or ability points
points yeah um i had a friend who

821
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.440
instead of describing instead of using
the um autistic or asd spoon system they

822
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.040
use uh ap
i like how much ap they have i like that

823
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.119
uh that is really cute um he's also a
huge gamer so

824
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:38.880
um nerd nerd um i also love just
complaining as we sit here talking about

825
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.000
mythology and fantasy for now uh jumping
on that he's the one i play league of

826
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:49.040
legends with a lot yeah um jumping off
of that uh i also love just chaotic um

827
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.079
systems of magic
like league of legends which like there

828
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:56.880
are no rules yeah um where it's like
it's instead of uh instead of magic

829
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.599
being this like kind of monolithic thing
it's like there are different realms of

830
00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:02.799
magic you can tap into and they all kind
of conflict with each other but it's

831
00:56:02.799 --> 00:56:07.760
okay because that's not what you're here
for um and like if you get so many

832
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.720
conflicting systems of magic it works
because these are consistent there are

833
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.720
enough of them that it doesn't need to
make sense yeah it's just chaos like

834
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.000
it's great um

835
00:56:21.359 --> 00:56:25.599
one thing i'm actually interested by the
um

836
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:28.000
thor ragnarok trailer buy i still
haven't watched it i've watched i've

837
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.799
seen clips or rag
is like kind of the mix of

838
00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:36.960
norse and greek mythology yeah and
that's actually something i'm going i'm

839
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.960
really wanting to do with the sovereign
wilds which is an upcoming um

840
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.240
fantasy well in it all the pantheons
exist and you're going around killing

841
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.440
them yeah yeah and like in in the book
i'm writing is like okay how do i create

842
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.400
oh my only
like

843
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:58.319
criticism of the trailer is
i wish gore didn't have a nose i wish he

844
00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:02.160
had the flat face but i understand that
they might have been like that's very

845
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.720
pale with flat face it's very voldemort
oh yeah yeah yeah so they might have not

846
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.920
wanted to go in there and christian bale
does have that face shape

847
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.200
yeah yeah
uh but yeah like and so the kind of

848
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.040
project that i gave to myself with the
sovereign wilds was i want to create a

849
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.520
world
where

850
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.280
all the gods all of these pantheons can
exist not only these pantheons can exist

851
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.839
but all how can all of their origin
stories and histories exist yeah and all

852
00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:32.240
be true and i kind of have it that like
as you move into different realms uh

853
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.480
where gods hold dominion the history of
the world changes yeah and the origin of

854
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.280
the world and the mechanics of the world
change

855
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.640
so that someone who knows witchcraft in
southern europe their magic doesn't work

856
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.240
in northern europe because the spirits
are different are different they speak

857
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.720
different languages they understand
different stories and they hold

858
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.240
different things as having different
symbologies yeah which is how you can

859
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:58.079
have everything be true and then have
this um

860
00:57:58.079 --> 00:58:04.079
singular monolithic
salty imperial god yeah um monotheistic

861
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:08.720
god really not liking the chaos and
wanting to kind of imperialize it all to

862
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.640
kind of streamline it yeah um as the
series goes on

863
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.040
and so that's kind of how i want to go
for that go from there and um i'm really

864
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.359
interested in like how conflicting
systems can interact and stuff yeah um

865
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:26.079
and like i said it's i i get to control
the rules so i have a fun time with it

866
00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.960
um but that one's also fun because i
have to play within the confines of

867
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.160
history and kind of suss out the
interesting parts of history in that

868
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.200
given in a given 20-year span yeah
around the 700 a.d

869
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.760
but um

870
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.960
that's most of most of what i got to say
about that

871
00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:48.400
and also kind of just re-reading my
theory that and kind of my take that uh

872
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.480
comic books and superheroes kind of
function as our modern day mythology oh

873
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.040
absolutely
um

874
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.640
like
you know superman is jesus

875
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.720
like it's it's obvious that superman is
jesus not even like as an allegorical

876
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.839
sense but just kind of speaking to a
modern context like what superman the

877
00:59:05.839 --> 00:59:09.520
values that superman represents the
value that spider-man represents and

878
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.960
what batman represents and how these
characters even though some of them are

879
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.280
flawed and tragic how they shape our
culture because they are very easy to

880
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.960
get passed around i was going to say i
think the difference is you know when

881
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.599
you look back at the different
mythologies

882
00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:25.760
um
the heroes

883
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.079
were very flawed heracles was very
flawed achilles was very flawed they had

884
00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:34.319
anger issues and stuff like that whereas
modern day

885
00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:38.559
you have superman who is flawless
more or less

886
00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:43.599
and i think that creates a
a kind of

887
00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:48.799
i want to say a disconnect but like
that's what makes it

888
00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:53.359
difficult for it to be
super superman yes but like you know

889
00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:57.680
look at batman and he has batman is not
super powers does that super does fit

890
00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.720
into the modern that's what i mean by
modern mythology achilles had no clear

891
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.240
superpowers so it's not about a demigod
they never homer never explained if

892
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.599
achilles had any super strength all he
said about achilles was that he was the

893
01:00:09.599 --> 01:00:14.559
greatest fighter of the generation yeah
um so like he killed his boyfriend he

894
01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:18.480
got tilted
till dead triggered um

895
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.480
slowly insofar as like batman function
there he is part of this this comic book

896
01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.000
universe he is a superhero he is
theatric he

897
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.680
is rooted in symbology yeah um and so i
think he is a superhero so regardless of

898
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.119
superpowers or not he is part of the
mythological canon of our day and age

899
01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:40.480
absolutely
and he is very flawed same as like luke

900
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.359
skywalker right yeah yeah exactly um
like in 500 years you could tell the

901
01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:48.720
story of luke skywalker and the fall of
the empire and stuff and it could be

902
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.319
mythology
and you do have other characters who do

903
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:55.680
have superpowers and are incredibly
flawed like the scarlet witch like jean

904
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.480
grey
um like magneto

905
01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.480
um
uh marvel seems to lean a lot heavier

906
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.520
and heavily or into that well yeah
there's a better end for work there's a

907
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.680
dichotomy between them that dc is god's
trying to be humans and marvel as humans

908
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.680
trying to be gods yeah um

909
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.040
and i i i don't i never really disagree
with that i think that's very abundantly

910
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.480
true even when it comes to like they're
like dc's lower line characters or

911
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.359
marvel's upper line characters yeah the
relationship of being related to gods

912
01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:30.480
kind of factors into these characters
and how they function on like a very

913
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.240
base level yeah um

914
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.040
jason todd another very flawed character
also mythological

915
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.280
or fantasy based he was resurrected he
was resurrected yeah literally by

916
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.680
lazarus and according to um this new
game lazarus pit the the new arkham

917
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.079
knights game he has magic boots
not magic he has magic feet he can jump

918
01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:56.559
across the air
oh yeah because he got super powers from

919
01:01:56.559 --> 01:02:00.559
being in the lazarus pit
okay people hate it

920
01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:04.559
people hate everything about that game i
know nothing about the game i have not

921
01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:08.799
seen one person say anything positive
about it i know nothing about the game

922
01:02:08.799 --> 01:02:12.160
yet
um

923
01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:17.200
but yeah it is interesting kind of
looking back at mythology

924
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.760
and seeing how it permeates
modern day stuff

925
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.599
even to the extent of like you look at
certain fascist regimes and how they

926
01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:33.520
took hold of mythology ancient mythology
and sometimes even misappropriate it oh

927
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.319
they always misappropriate it because
the nazis like to leave out that the

928
01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:40.799
aesir were immigrants yeah the vania the
peace-loving vayner were the locals they

929
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:45.680
were the natives yeah um but like the
it's just not the not just the nazis

930
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.079
there's plenty of different oh yeah
absolutely the aunties i think are the

931
01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:51.839
most obvious example because they really
latched on well yeah because they were

932
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:55.119
actually looking into the occult and
stuff yeah

933
01:02:55.119 --> 01:03:00.079
little crazy whereas the soviets didn't
really latch on to um slavic myth

934
01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:02.880
no which i feel like is a missed
opportunity probably a missed

935
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.800
opportunity you could have scared the
[ __ ] out of capital let's be like

936
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.400
[Laughter]
she's coming um and also like

937
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.640
uh but at the same time mythology and
rediscovering mythology is having a

938
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.880
massively important effect on
reconstructing formerly colonized

939
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.920
communities yeah um that's true here in
canada uh in the americas

940
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.480
um native communities native communities
especially um

941
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.400
you see that in some southern american
areas where there's there's a big kind

942
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.359
of in the jewish community there's a big
um

943
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:44.799
reaching back into hebrew mythology and
kind of bringing that into more not

944
01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:48.240
mainstream belief but kind of teaching
your kids about it and stuff because

945
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.880
it's just so mythology is really really
cool yeah and because it shows

946
01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.119
i think that like
we are

947
01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:59.920
a people who
have

948
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.440
thousands of years of stories
back before the world was as it is now

949
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.400
kind of thing yeah back when the world
had magic

950
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.039
um
and it's kind of saying like

951
01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:15.359
as the jewish people
we were here when the world had magic

952
01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:20.400
and i think that's very heartwarming
yeah it's very it it's very hopeful yeah

953
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.880
because you see that a lot in ireland uh
yeah yeah really big in ireland

954
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.280
reclamation of old stories you see that
a lot in scandinavia less so to a you

955
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.720
know actual practicing degree outside of
iceland they practice in iceland they

956
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.960
practice north uh heathenism north
mythology yeah uh the rel the religion

957
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.720
is called heathenism uh in iceland and
as as per a um commenter mentioned in

958
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.000
spain
i don't know you remember that

959
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.880
i think i remember yeah someone pointed
out that they prac there are areas of

960
01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.240
spain that practice uh norse mythology
because there were a lot of viking

961
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.280
settlements on the coast of spain
because that's well the vikings came

962
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.520
here
yeah the vikings did come here but like

963
01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.119
i'm just like even though spain swing
was um they left but they came here

964
01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:04.000
because they were like it's [ __ ] cold
it's [ __ ] cold

965
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.240
uh

966
01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:09.680
the vikings say it's too cold yeah the
vikings set up a lot of trade posts

967
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.599
around the uh mediterranean coast and
some of them were quite very very

968
01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:18.960
significant
so yeah mythology mythology fantasy

969
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.960
and the religions that they have
inspired it's very it's all interesting

970
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.400
it's i could go on and on and on that's
something that i honestly dislike about

971
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.280
the christianization because like the
crystallization that was peddled to

972
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.559
europe and the rest of the world was so
dry

973
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:38.079
yeah and lifeless you had this colorful
these colorful sagas and you replaced it

974
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:42.240
with jesus jesus was nice to some people
now we're going to be mean to you yeah

975
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.559
it's like jesus fish and bread
jesus fish in bed and we're going to use

976
01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:49.839
the stories of jesus's kindness to
oppress you and like that replaced

977
01:05:49.839 --> 01:05:56.319
gilgamesh and like in kidu and all of
this like lots of very queer stories

978
01:05:56.319 --> 01:06:00.799
like yeah for instance kukulen
there is a very obvious queer reading to

979
01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:04.559
that yeah uh and in some ways that are
even and i mean in egypt mythology

980
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:07.280
there's literally
gay gods

981
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:12.880
semen drinking semen eating incest um
well we don't need to associate

982
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.160
queerness with incest i mean no no it
was his uncle

983
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.640
oh yeah horace's uncle i mean but then
again when it comes to gods and families

984
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.799
it's always very loose so and then we
got the abrahamic religions which are

985
01:06:24.799 --> 01:06:29.039
just so boring islam is a little bit
more interesting

986
01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:32.000
mythologically speaking like the earlier
well yeah but

987
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.039
hebrew mythology is super interesting
too it's christian mythology that's

988
01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:38.799
[ __ ] boring yeah yeah like although
some of the old testament's really

989
01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:43.200
interesting but it's very so moral but
again it is very moralized and a lot of

990
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.359
the old testament and so far as it's
translated into english is lifeless it

991
01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:50.799
doesn't really have any life or
character to it it's it's like i said

992
01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:54.880
last night in the stream like it's uh we
did the stream last night by the way um

993
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.799
it's a it's a presentation
it's time to present something to you

994
01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:01.680
aside from the story it's like yeah
these guys were like this there's

995
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.000
nothing about character there's
something about what these characters

996
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.599
were
or or anything it's just very dry yeah

997
01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:14.880
yeah mythology apology so our next
episode will be back to normal it won't

998
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:21.359

topical um than

999
01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:26.799
ranting about mythology and comic books

1000
01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:30.480

or chicken pox or small pox or any of
the pox i wonder if you've gotten

1012
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.520
chicken pox twice if you're immune to
monkey pox i think chicken pox the

1013
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.400
second time is
shingles

1014
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.480
because i've had it twice the second
time was not as severe i only had it

1015
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.080
once okay thank god i think no no it's
if you don't get chicken pox you can get

1016
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.400
shingles no it's if you do then you're
predisposed to getting shingles because

1017
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.799
the virus is already in you okay
