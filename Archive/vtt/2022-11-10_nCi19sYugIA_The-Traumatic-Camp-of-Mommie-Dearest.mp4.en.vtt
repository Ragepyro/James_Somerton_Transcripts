00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.320
Susan Sontag in her essay notes on Camp
often cited as the quintessential

2
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
document on Camp culture remarks in
association between gays and camp and as

3
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
she was writing in the 1960s she was
highlighting a very retroactive

4
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
depiction from her upbringing Baby Jane
had only just come out when this paper

5
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640
was published this indicates that gay
attraction to overwrought and badly

6
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.579
depicted feminine archetypes was well
solidified long before 1981 when the

7
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.920
infamous Mommy Dearest premiered the
purported true story of growing up with

8
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
movie star Joan Crawford as a mother
through the process of imitation Baby

9
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.980
Jane Cleopatra Martha Eve Harrington and
Crawford herself are imitated here to

10
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.180
the point wherein Faye dunaway's mind
playing Joan Crawford this is a

11
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.619
perfectly nuanced depiction of holly
Woods archetypal movie star John Waters

12
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.340
described Mommy Dearest as the first
drag queen role played by a woman and

13
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.780
he's not wrong but it seems to be
completely by accident films that are

14
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
accidental Camp are kind of rare without
clear intent failed Camp either goes so

15
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.880
big that it looks cheap and we
disconnect or they don't go big enough

16
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
either way we don't make a point of
remembering those movies so when one

17
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.659
does manage to hit the right buttons
we hold on to it for dear life so enter

18
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.240
Mommy Dearest first published as a book
by Christina Crawford in 1978 describing

19
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.020
her torturous relationship with her
mother Joan one year after Joan's death

20
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.180
in 1977. the story is about a daughter
who is struggling to reconcile her love

21
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.820
for an abusive parent which
would have made a great movie in no time

22
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.420
at all Studios snatched up the rights to
the story and Christina herself wrote a

23
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.079
script when Faye Dunaway was cast in the
lead role riding on her Oscar from

24
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.759
1977's Network the studio and Fey
herself wanted to restructure the script

25
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.899
to center around Crawford with Faye's
husband who she managed to make a

26
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.220
producer on the film trying to sanitize
Joan and Christina's husband being

27
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.540
accused of trying to turn Joan into a
monster so

28
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.319
what Joan did we get the film opens with
dunaway's Crawford Hollywood queen

29
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.940
musing about how despite her success in
global Allure she feels like there's

30
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.580
just something missing from her life yes
her career is in a bit of a slump but

31
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.300
she isn't as concerned about that
because she thinks that just means that

32
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.000
now is a great time to become a mother
unable to Bear children she begins to

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
suggest the option of adoption to her
then boyfriend and Hollywood lawyer Greg

34
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.560
sabat who helps her pull the strings she
needs to pull to have an adoption agency

35
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.500
hand her a baby this scene is played
entirely straight by the way this visual

36
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.099
pulls Crawford to the center of
attention like a rifenstall-esque

37
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.560
monarch or Idol once again unnecessary
Pathos and all this unnecessary pathos

38
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.560
feeds into this lofty visual language of
Jones Perfection channeled through

39
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000
Dunaway we're only five minutes in and
no it does not slow down from here the

40
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.379
First Act of the film explores the
strange power dynamic between Joan and

41
00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.800
her young daughter Christina this is
where most of the iconic scenes of the

42
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.280
movie come from because this is where
Joan is depicted at her most unhinged

43
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.599
now how can one of the most powerful
actresses in Hollywood's history have a

44
00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.300
struggle for power
with a child well that's something that

45
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.700
critics slam the script for there isn't
really any textual reason for why Joan

46
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.840
is such a terror to her family there's
no reason why Joan is triggered at the

47
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.900
sight of a wire hanger or why
Christopher has to wear a harness to bed

48
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.540
which feeds into the insanity of this
role there are all of these compulsions

49
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.659
but no exploration as to why the surface
level of the analysis is out to

50
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.400
seemingly use Joan to subvert the
expectations of a Hollywood star Someone

51
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.019
For Whom the public laud is the ideal of
perfection in Womanhood though in

52
00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.840
reality is a monster in her private life
when cameras are on she's Joan Crawford

53
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.979
when they're off she's a woman who is
desperately trying to keep everyone in

54
00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.419
line so that she can be Joan Crawford
already the gays are on board for that

55
00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.220
we love expose on fakeness feels like
gossip with substance guilt-free

56
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.240
relating to our personal lives a lot of
queer people people in the community

57
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.500
come from families that an outsider
would say are ideal but for those of us

58
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.300
who have to live with our parents
homophobic attitudes that Perfection is

59
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.960
a little
different behind closed doors parents

60
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.280
often let nasty things slip when they're
away from polite company and that's

61
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.540
doubly complicated because it means
nobody believes you especially nowadays

62
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.220
when bigotry isn't quite so in Vogue
parents still do and say homophobic and

63
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.740
transphobic [ __ ] but they do get a
little gas lady about it dare I say

64
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.340
Shady I've even heard of situations
especially from trans people where their

65
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600
own therapists will try convincing them
that they're making up their parents

66
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.860
transphobia however just because there's
no surface reading doesn't mean that

67
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.300
explanations aren't inferred which is
mostly on fade unaway for sucking up

68
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.780
every drop of attention away from any
deeper analysis look a little deeper

69
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.080
into Jones parenting in Christina's
early life and especially Jones

70
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.720
biographical context and you guessed it
there's a commentary about youth and

71
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.039
Beauty in multiple instances in Mommy
Dearest whenever it seems that Christina

72
00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.500
is coming of age as a lady Jones sees
that as competition from living out a

73
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.100
fantasy and the spotlight to taking a
few tricks from Jones own book on how to

74
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.699
flirt with men Christina is a threat to
Jones Reign Christina is both a rival a

75
00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.199
symbol of her fading youth a child a
miniature version of Joan within whom

76
00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.479
she can place all her expectations and
an opportunity to exercise her Authority

77
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.940
Christina must be better than Joan but
also Joan must use Christina to prove

78
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.440
that she's still at the top of her game
she both pushes Christina beyond what is

79
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.940
reasonable to expect of a little girl
and also smugly Revels in Christina's

80
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.199
failures often resorting to humiliating
Christina as a punishment for either not

81
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:28.340
being perfect or for seemingly
encroaching on Jones reign

82
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.020
don't tell me

83
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.699
yeah I know you look awful you'll be
quiet you're always rummaging through my

84
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.819
drawers trying to find a way to make
people look at you while you're always

85
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.139
looking at yourself in the mirror why
are you doing that tell me Joan is so

86
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.280
fixated on Perfection that she can't
handle it when things don't quite fall

87
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.479
into place following several poor
performing films MGM releases Joan from

88
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.199
her contract this compiles with a string
of failed romances and triggers a

89
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.819
Cascade of Jones Greatest fears her
beauty something she felt was her

90
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.680
primary asset
is fading but what terrifies her is that

91
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.900
she does not have the talent to make up
for it in her defense yes MGM was

92
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.639
shafting her as a human being she was
aging but they continued to cast her in

93
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.860
roles as if she was the Joan Crawford
that she was 15 years prior instead of

94
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.639
I don't know letting her play more
mature roles they just cut her loose

95
00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:31.560
because she wasn't ageless Joan Crawford
it is implied held herself up to

96
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.340
Perfection because she accurately
assumed that a single slip up

97
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.900
would have her thrown to the dogs and
when that fear was validated we can

98
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.280
expect some erratic Behavior which gives
us one of the most iconic scenes in Camp

99
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.580
history

100
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:54.060
so Hollywood is an absurd place it's why
movies about Hollywood generally don't

101
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.599
click with General audiences because
it's a place like no other so you're

102
00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.800
already in absurd territory but instead
of mitigating the absurdity and

103
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.880
explaining the kind of anxieties and
pressure that exist in this place

104
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.639
there's Joan down on the ground hacking
away at roses in a

105
00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:17.660
gorgeous beaded gown and that line
delivery Tina

106
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.639
bring me the air where each word is
punctuated with an entirely distinct and

107
00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:29.819
separate emotion it's a complete sensory
overload and honestly

108
00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:34.860
though the quote gets thrown around fans
of the scene are missing two of the best

109
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.159
parts first the fact that they actually
committed to a wide shot of fey hacking

110
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.720
away at that orange tree in that gown
ah

111
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:55.080
second Jones says bring me the ax the ax
the ax not bring me an ax bring me the

112
00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.660
ax in the literal syntactic text of the
movie we can gauge that this is a

113
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.180
regular Occurrence at the Crawford
household because Christina didn't

114
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.080
Flinch and she knew exactly which acts
to get and where to get it

115
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.459
I feel as if the movie had done even the
slightest amount of work to bring out

116
00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:22.620
the aforementioned subtext you could
pull off this exact scene as a harrowing

117
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.300
self-destruction of Jones psyche reading
into it Joan feels her perfect garden

118
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.040
must match her internalized feeling of
inadequacy if MGM tells her that she's

119
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.100
not perfect
then there's no point in having anything

120
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.000
perfect around why should something be
more perfect than her if being perfect

121
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.040
was her only value it could be a really
gripping scene the problem is that

122
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.060
without adequate build up or actual
exploration of Jones emotions

123
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.320
instead with Dunaway opting to depict
these emotions as mood swings this scene

124
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.459
comes out of nowhere it's also worth
mentioning that this film doesn't really

125
00:09:56.459 --> 00:10:00.420
follow a narrative we go from Jones
celebrating her long-awaited Oscar win

126
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:08.459
and the winner is
directly into no water hi guys ever

127
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:12.839
which again
could be a legitimately terrifying scene

128
00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:15.959
if there was any kind of narrative
consequentialism that said when it comes

129
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:20.700
to abusive households there's usually
this soft reset button at the end of the

130
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.080
episode where there's an unspoken
agreement to leave it in the past at

131
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.279
least when it involves younger children
which in and of itself is a really eerie

132
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:32.880
and unsettling concept though Mommy
Dearest does absolutely nothing to

133
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.779
establish this precedence with spoken or
visual language and no the abuse does

134
00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:40.560
not end with Jones shipping Christina
off to boarding school which it is

135
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.860
implied Joan was doing because she
observed her daughter beginning to

136
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.120
experiment with flirting not on her
watch when Christina is caught kissing a

137
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.500
boy at the school she's reprimanded by
the administration but Joan insists that

138
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.920
she be expelled for some reason and
instead pulls Christina out of the

139
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.120
school now as it turned out Beyond just
kissing boys Christina ended up quite

140
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.779
enjoying her time away from her mother
at the boarding school and given that

141
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.140
the discipline obsessed Joan originally
intended private school to be a

142
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.420
punishment enjoying a punishment is also
so something that will not happen on her

143
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.660
watch leading to another iconic scene
Barbara please

144
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.620
Barbara
bringing Christina home as she has an

145
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.640
interview schedule Joan coiley if not
proudly remarks that Christina was

146
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.660
expelled after telling Christina not to
talk about the expulsion I can't think

147
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.040
of a single parent who would gloat about
their child's expulsion

148
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.899
but to Joan it's almost like a victory a
failure for a rival is a victory for her

149
00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.700
Christina points out to the reporter
that she was not in fact expelled

150
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.620
twitched Joan throws a fit over being
accused of lying even though

151
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.579
she was lying why do you deliberately
defy me why did you tell her I got

152
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:58.519
expelled because you did get expelled

153
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.220
when Christina calls her out Joan just
goes right on and slaps her in front of

154
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.300
the reporter and then blames her for
making her embarrass herself in front of

155
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.380
the reporter you

156
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.860
you'll be in front of a reporter
Joan begins to spiral aimlessly with

157
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.519
such and such parental insults about
gratitude but it seems like Christina is

158
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:27.660
done with this song and dance and asks
why Joan bothered to adopt her if Joan

159
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.380
didn't seem to want anything to do with
Christina why did you adopt me

160
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.839
for a little extra publicity
tensions rise and why can't

161
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:54.980
why can't you get on the street because
I am not one of your fans

162
00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.380
and now we're getting into the territory
of Christina's accounts that can be

163
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.180
backed up by fact fact number one
is that yes Joan really did replace

164
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.720
Christina on a soap opera that Christina
was cast in Joan in her 60s takes the

165
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.440
role of a 28 year old woman while
Christina is recovering from a benign

166
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.779
ovarian tumor fact number two is another
iconic scene Joan Crawford was on the

167
00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:26.220
board of directors for PepsiCo via her
husband the company was a nothing up

168
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.000
start to compete with the Behemoth that
was Coca-Cola Joan was brought on as a

169
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.660
brand ambassador and basically made the
company into what it was Joan married

170
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.279
the CEO and the board of directors did
try to force her out after his death in

171
00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:42.899
the film this encounter is depicted with
Jones screaming into the boardroom

172
00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:48.180
famously saying don't with me fellas and
though this is a famous line from the

173
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.940
film it's not the line that was lifted
from the secretary's notes of the

174
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.560
meeting but Joan did say to the
directors I fought worse monsters than

175
00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.540
you for years in Hollywood I know how to
win the hard way ironically this is one

176
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.500
of dunaway's more understated lines in
the entire film this meeting in reality

177
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.639
was much more cordial than Dunaway
delivered why did it need to get turned

178
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:12.899
up to an 11.
why not that's why rounding off the film

179
00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:16.500
is the reading of Joan Crawford's will
with Christina and Christopher when it

180
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.899
comes to what Joan left them Joan writes
that they will receive nothing

181
00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:26.279
or reasons which are well known
to them

182
00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:29.820
which was the literal reading of the
will

183
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.560
that happened that's the last thing
Christopher and Christina ever heard

184
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.880
from their mother and when asked
apparently neither of them

185
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.320
know what those reasons were there are
some suggestions that Joan wrote them

186
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.720
out of the will because she heard
Christina was already writing Mommy

187
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.019
Dearest while Joan was alive but that
doesn't explain why she Nicks

188
00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:52.440
Christopher the film doesn't even
mention Jones younger two children who

189
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.279
she adopted just about the same time
that Christina went off to boarding

190
00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:01.380
school funny timing that now as with all
great camp movies half of the fun is the

191
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.000
gossip and the making of Mommy Dearest
is no exception as mentioned Mommy

192
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.680
Dearest was a celebrity expose
Christina's account is a pained

193
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.519
tormented struggle between loving her
mother and recalling good memories of

194
00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:20.279
Joan but also living through some
very traumatic abuse and behavior though

195
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:24.779
the way Hollywood figures talk about it
especially those who are close to Joan

196
00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:29.699
even Betty Davis herself Christina makes
Joan out to be a demon that she wasn't

197
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:34.260
who's one of the worst people you know
in Hollywood that I worked with or that

198
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
she wouldn't want to work with again if
you don't you don't have one million

199
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.399
dollars pay done away but the book is
much tame her especially if your frame

200
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.120
of reference is the movie and honestly a
lot of the vitriol that gets slung at

201
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.680
Christina is well I never saw Joan beat
her children I never saw this happen

202
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.519
well I never saw Harvey Weinstein rape
anybody which you'd think in this post

203
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.420
me too believe victim society that
excuse wouldn't fly but Christina to

204
00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:04.199
this day has haters I think Christine
was very very envious of Joan Crawford

205
00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:09.540
and her public and her popularity and
her beauty Hollywood is said to be a

206
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.760
small town and the vitriol directed at
Christina May simply be them protecting

207
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.660
one of their own Christina does make a
point of specifically blaming Hollywood

208
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.519
for crafting Jones narcissism before the
fall of the studio system the studios

209
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:28.019
themselves would mold Their Stars into
fitting specific personality ideals to

210
00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:32.820
put on errors not only for cameras but
for fans in private it was rare that

211
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.360
you'd get a star like Davis or Catherine
Hepburn who didn't bother with the

212
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.560
facade this is apparent in a documentary
called Bright Lights starring Carrie

213
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.279
Fisher and Debbie Reynolds
may they rest in peace Reynolds while

214
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:49.199
being interviewed still had her
signature Debbie Reynolds charm however

215
00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:53.820
the documentary crew kept the cameras
rolling when Carrie took her aside from

216
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.740
around the corner Debbie's voice is much
weaker and more vulnerable even though

217
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.240
she was a woman in her 80s Debbie
Reynolds was a mask she had to wear for

218
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.140
the public luckily she did have a
supportive family with whom she didn't

219
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.520
have to wear it Christina's take seems
to be that Jones simply wasn't able to

220
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.559
take that mask off at all
and resorted to drastic Behavior

221
00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:21.419
when the porcelain started to crack but
with all the hatred toward the story and

222
00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:25.140
toward Christina
it does Boggle my mind that Hollywood

223
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.799
was so horny to get this movie made as
soon as the book came out you couldn't

224
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:33.360
find anyone who had anything good to say
about it Faye Dunaway herself agreed to

225
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.080
play the role as long as it was more
respectful to Jones memory

226
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.539
than the book though Christina's book
was obviously an exploitation book the

227
00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:48.480
first one of its kind my task was to
portray a woman a full woman who she was

228
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.940
in all her facets not just one
I tried to illuminate who this woman was

229
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:59.160
but it was more than just about being
angry it was about trying to examine and

230
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.500
explore the forces that undermined her
I don't think Faye and I watched the

231
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.380
same movie Christina actually did not
feel the dunaway's performance

232
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.620
accurately depicted her mother
specifically claiming that dunaway's

233
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.880
depiction of Joan was far more monstrous
than she ever experienced is that

234
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.860
anywhere near the way Joan Crawford
actually acted only the makeup Faye

235
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.880
Dunaway specifically went out of her way
to manipulate the script the director

236
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.520
and producers to humanize Joan all the
while lambasting the book as tabloid

237
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.500
drivel only for the author of that
drivel to decry the performance for

238
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.360
depicting a monster it also didn't help
that Dunaway was already kind of a diva

239
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.000
once again ironically Joan Crawford was
quoted saying of all the actresses to me

240
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.880
only Faye Dunaway has the talent and the
class and the courage it takes to make a

241
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.100
real star Dunaway later blamed Mommy
Dearest for hurting her career and given

242
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.059
that she was a bit of a hot ticket
actress before the 80s she was forced

243
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.799
into roles in smaller films for the rest
of her life and on one hand you may say

244
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:08.220
it's because of her performance but
plenty of actors have had bad roles

245
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.460
maybe nothing so Monumental is this but
Faye was a bit of a hassle you see on

246
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.940
top of being a prima donna in general
she allegedly terrorized the set of

247
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.940
Mommy Dearest for starters she refused
to drop out of character during

248
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.539
production so on top of delivering
that on camera the crew and cast had to

249
00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:32.160
live with that for weeks rutanya Alda
who played Jones assistant in the film

250
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.220
wrote a behind the scenes Memoir about
the filming experience she wrote people

251
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.820
despised Faye because she was rude to
people everyone was on pins and needles

252
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.080
when she worked and relaxed when she
didn't to name a few things Faye

253
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.700
allegedly manipulated the director to
Rob other actors of their screen time to

254
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.720
pull it to herself she also insisted
that people on set needed to turn away

255
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.120
from her while she was performing
because she didn't want an audience

256
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.720
regarding her method acting and will
avoid a discussion about what method

257
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.340
acting really is and how a lot of actors
misuse the term Dunaway had the usual

258
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.900
nonsense to say but with an extra twist
if your mind is on a woman who is dead

259
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.940
and you're trying to find out who she
was and do right by her you do feel a

260
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.080
presence
I felt it at home at night sometimes it

261
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.039
wasn't pleasant I felt Joan was not at
rest so I think what happened is that

262
00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:33.720
Faye was so engaged with the memory of
Joan that she may have spurred a

263
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.100
vindictive streak against Christina and
so she kind of took out all that bottled

264
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.059
up rage
on the Effigy of Christina which is why

265
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:46.919
you got all this aggression I think well
there was an initial wave of critics who

266
00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:51.600
hailed her performance it didn't take
long for the public perception to swing

267
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.760
the other way going down is one of the
best bad performances of all time a

268
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.200
serious actress like Faye Dunaway did
not cut into that idea she blamed the

269
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.400
director for not reeling her back she
blamed the editors and the producers for

270
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.860
taking her depiction of a window into a
tormented soul and making it Camp she

271
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.240
blamed Christina and her husband she
blamed Christina's book and worst of all

272
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.559
she blamed her audience for not taking
away her intended interpretation though

273
00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:24.660
she has come around to the unforeseen
fandom of the film but still doesn't

274
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:30.360
quite get what they see in it because
make no mistake there is a fandom around

275
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.740
this moving picture little did Dunaway
know she had opened the floodgates to a

276
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.840
whole fandom that had only until then
existed in burlesque shows a fandom that

277
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.280
upon the movie's release would hang
Christina Crawford in effigy

278
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.720
Mommy Dearest
legitimized a whole group of audiences

279
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.320
and creators who were going to do what
Dunaway did

280
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.659
but do it on purpose
with or without the ghost of Joan

281
00:21:57.659 --> 00:21:59.960
Crawford
