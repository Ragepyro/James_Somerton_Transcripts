00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.290
coming up on the drop zone cap you do
anything fun Saturday night well all the

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.570
guys in my barbershop quartet are dead
so no not really you know if you ask

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.800
Kristen out from Statistics you'd
probably say yes it's why don't ask too

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.430
shy or too scared too busy Captain
America the First Avenger was probably

5
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.210
one of the riskier movies in the first
phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.180
the hero is named after undressed in the
flag of a country that isn't exactly

7
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.960
winning a lot of global popularity
contest right now it was a period piece

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
taking place during World War two and
there's nothing really that I catching

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.309
about the character Iron Man has that
amazing suit Thor has lightning and his

10
00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.019
hammer The Hulk is a giant green monster
but Captain America is just a really

11
00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.010
strong guy with an awesomely strong
shield so it took a lot of guts to bring

12
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.969
him to the silver screen and luckily for
Marvel it worked out Captain America the

13
00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.749
First Avenger received critical acclaim
across the board and a strong showing at

14
00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.859
the box office since then Marvel has
become one of the strongest forces in

15
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.490
Hollywood today with the Avengers in
iron man 3 smashing box office records

16
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
all over the world and Thor sequel the
dark world eclipsing its predecessor at

17
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.799
the box office now it's time for the red
white and blue Boy Scout to come back

18
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.119
for his second go-around up until now
Marvel's second phase has been good but

19
00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.979
not great iron man 3 angered fans with
some of its plot twists and Thor 2 was

20
00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.820
light on any meaningful character
development except for Loki so one

21
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.960
couldn't be blamed for having low
expectations for Captain America 2 but

22
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.939
the captain knocks it out of the park in
a big way the winter soldier is far more

23
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.689
of a spy thriller than a superhero movie
and it actually works out really well

24
00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.350
since Captain America's powers aren't
nearly as flashy as some of these

25
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.490
Avengers counterparts the acting is
about what you'd expect from a Marvel

26
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.020
movie now ranging from good to great
Chris Evans is of course perfect is a

27
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.939
good captain the persona the physicality
it works just as well as it always has I

28
00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.479
really enjoyed the moments that had
Steve Rogers as a man at a time like

29
00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.990
checking off cultural touchstones that
have taken place since he was frozen I

30
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.050
wish there was more of that in the movie
but I can't really complain too much

31
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.100
because it's not like the rest of the
movie is lacking because of it samuel l

32
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.659
jackson is finally given his time
shine in this movie instead of being a

33
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.650
glorified cameo in the other Marvel
films Scarlett Johansson's black widow

34
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.739
steals the show on more than one
occasion and this really justifies all

35
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.340
the hype for there being a black widow
solo movie or at least the Black Widow

36
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.750
and Hawkeye team up Sebastian stands
Winter Soldier is a force to be reckoned

37
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
with in the film though I think he's a
little underused considering his name is

38
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.950
at the title Anthony Mackie is a great
addition to the cast bringing some

39
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.269
levity to the movie while still having
some gravitas speaking of levity that is

40
00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.260
one thing that the directors anthony and
joe russo really nail in this movie and

41
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.439
that's the mixture of levity and
darkness the winter soldier is first and

42
00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.889
foremost a thriller it's not a comedy
but it has enough comedic moments

43
00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.609
sprinkled throughout skillfully I might
add that it makes the darker more

44
00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.139
serious beats hit even harder it's the
perfect mix and what I've rarely seen in

45
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.500
a comic book movie another thing the
Russo brothers get right is the action

46
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.129
they're the fun ripping can't look away
action sequences that really add to the

47
00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.310
movie instead of being a time where you
could check your phone or go refill your

48
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.269
soda these are easily the best action
sequences Marvel's put on the silver

49
00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.290
screen since the Avengers and they may
be even better speaking of the Avengers

50
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.519
captain america the winter soldier is a
direct sequel to the marble blockbuster

51
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.739
and a direct preload to the Avengers 2
age of Ultron I won't give anything away

52
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.579
but if you plan on sandy Avengers 2 next
summer you should definitely see the

53
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.840
Winter Soldier first no spoilers just
take my word for us captain america the

54
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.680
winter soldier is the type of comic book
movie that actually transcends the label

55
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.849
it's not just a great comic book movie
but a great movie in its own right it

56
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.650
eclipses its phase two predecessors and
most if not all of phase one and well in

57
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.220
my humble opinion i think captain
america the winter soldier could very

58
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.299
well be the best Marvel movie to date
and should maybe make DC rethink

59
00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.879
releasing Batman vs Superman on the same
day as Captain America 3 in 2016 so what

60
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.939

the winter soldier leave your comments
