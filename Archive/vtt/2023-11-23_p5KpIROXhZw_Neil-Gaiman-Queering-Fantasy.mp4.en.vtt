00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.000
this video is brought to you by
Squarespace as diversity becomes more

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.439
and more of a sticking point in our
social landscape discourse around

3
00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.480
representation follows close behind
there is a precedent for developing an

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.840
incorrect narrative around romanticized
historical events presenting sentiments

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.320
that simply don't represent a community
as a whole and struggling to actively

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.160
showcase visible representation or
understand what qualifies as visible

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.759
representation and of course when you do
get representation right you actually

8
00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.640
have to go to the right lengths to
promote it just like you would any other

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.760
property but that said it's not like
good representation doesn't exist

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800
usually when the people who are being
represented get to make their own stuff

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.600
it tends to be well-received sometimes
not whether I agree with the response or

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.879
not but usually if you exist within the
queer Community you generally have a

13
00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.120
better understanding of how to Showcase
these people what matters to them what

14
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.000
their values are and what you can even
make fun of without insulting everyone

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.200
and believe me the queer Community has a
heap of that for instance transmen and

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.000
enbs for some reason really like rats
like pet rats a lot of them feel this

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
way and nobody knows why though for
people who are not queer themselves but

18
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.680
who do want to create queer characters
there are a range of challenges that

19
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.200
they face such as limited perspective
straight riters by virtue of their own

20
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.840
sexual Orient ation likely don't have
firsthand experience with the unique

21
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.960
challenges emotions and nuances that
queer individuals face and cultural

22
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.280
sensitivity and accuracy straight
writers might lack this cultural

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.840
sensitivity leading to
misrepresentations or inaccurate

24
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.920
depictions that fail to capture the
essence of queer lives the potential for

25
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.479
unintentional insensitivity can arise
from a lack of research or an

26
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.719
overreliance on current mainstream media
representations there's also the fear of

27
00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.479
offending this fear may lead them to
tiptoe around important issues or

28
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.360
sanitize the experience of queer
characters resulting in narratives that

29
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.440
lack depth and emotional resonance and
there's stereotyping and tokenism when

30
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.120
queer characters are reduced to being
nothing but their sexual orientation or

31
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.120
gender identity becoming defined solely
by this one part of themselves rather

32
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
than their personalities aspirations and
complexities and this is perhaps true of

33
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.760
all categories of diverse characters
however there is a recent Buzz around

34
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
queerness both from consumers and
producers and through this Buzz we've

35
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.040
seen the Good the Bad and the Ugly and
while queer creators are finally getting

36
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.040
a chance to tell their own stories
straight creators can struggle to

37
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.280
deliver these same
messages so that being

38
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.560
said why is Neil gaming so good at it

Squarespace Neil Gaiman typifies a sort
of literary polymorph where in spite of

57
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.959
his cultural impact he has written or
contributed to a total of only 11 novels

58
00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.959
however factoring in his work in
screenplays tele plays Comics children's

59
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.520
books and non-fiction Gaiman has a
considerable library of work including

60
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.320
the creation of a certain dark-haired
magical boy with an owl familiar which

61
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.759
was suspiciously published through DC
Comics 7 years prior to Harry Potter

62
00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.880
hitting the
shelves must be magic granted I say only

63
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.560
11 novels as if even that isn't
impressive whereas once it was not

64
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.280
considered out of the ordinary to be
invited into literary cannon with far

65
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.320
less than 11 published works that's
usually not possible today unless of

66
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.120
course one comes from money or is the
one new author of a decade that the

67
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.680
publishing industry has decided to Rally
behind but especially as far as

68
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.759
high-profile writers go Gaiman has
peppered his library of works with a

69
00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.360
broad range of diverse characters
representing a myriad of Life

70
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.160
Experiences similar to the forced
wokeness accusations that were hurled at

71
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.479
the rings of power which focused more on
gender and race than the broad changes

72
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.919
to the characters and mythology the
Netflix adaptation of gamon's iconic

73
00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.919
Sandman series was given the same
criticism from the predictable kinds of

74
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.400
people the displeasure at seeing queer
experiences on the screen clearly

75
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.319
indicated that these particular critics
hadn't read The Source material maybe

76
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.720
they just looked at the pictures G
Renown as a writer truly began in 1990

77
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.759
when he co-authored good Omens with
literary giant Terry pratchet according

78
00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.600
to Legend Neil pitched the idea to
pratchet offand at a convention to which

79
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.039
pratchet seemed agreeable though Neil
assumed that he was just being let down

80
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.280
gently and put it out of his mind
sometime later Neil got a phone call

81
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.479
from pratchet who wanted to know how
this misplaced Antichrist idea might

82
00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.400
play out in so far as the author's
developed this Cosmos neither angels nor

83
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.479
demons have sex organs nor do they
actively seek out sexual intercourse and

84
00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.479
and by all accounts gender is more or
less described based on how an observer

85
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.560
might categorize them regardless even of
that this he they angel demon Duo are so

86
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.880
incredibly married it was basically a
joke even at the time of good oman's

87
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.720
publication while many fans of the show
and even of the book were quick to

88
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.440
describe a Zera which is a fictional
name approved by spell Che believe it or

89
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.160
not and Crowley as a gay couple it was
indeed exasperated by gaiman's

90
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.120
description of the tale as a love story
and yet both God the narrator of the

91
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.840
story and Gaiman are hesit to use the
term gay to describe them but unlike

92
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.160
your average Network Executive Press
Conference or corporate social media

93
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.800
account this explanation is queerer than
the typical just friends copout the

94
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000
narrator describes that most people who
encounter aerail May describe him as

95
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.440
quote gayer than a tree full of monkeys
on nitrous oxide but does not describe a

96
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.479
zerel as gay himself gaimon elaborated
that the love story between a zerel and

97
00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.960
Crowley is not gay because neither of
them are men one is an Angel and the

98
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.919
other a demon neither of whom whom are
beings that have sex traits and any

99
00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.520
ambiguity in the first story is
dismissed in the second you're a good

100
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.440
lad not actually either this suggests
that any element of gender expression is

101
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.520
the result of self-identification or a
matter of how Others May observe them

102
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.759
furthermore the celestial beings seem to
refer to each other by they them from an

103
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.759
authorial standpoint this is a complex
understanding of gender and sexuality

104
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.560
that is even a little bit theoretical
for many within the community itself if

105
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.000
there is no element of sex or G gender
present in a romantic pairing how can we

106
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.120
describe the sexual orientation of the
couple the unfortunate thing about the

107
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.919
term homosexual is that it describes not
only the gender of the subject's

108
00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:43.000
attraction but the gender of the subject
as well

109
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.400
homosexual same gender attraction you
need to have a gender to be attracted to

110
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.560
the same gender as the public begins to
understand and accept a separation of

111
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.479
sex and gender many of these sexual
labels fail to describe what they are

112
00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:59.400
meant to an amab trans non-binary person
who is attracted to high feminine gender

113
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.879
traits among gay
men we don't have language to describe

114
00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.759
that yet factor in that both zerel and
Crowley have a very ambiguous set of

115
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.560
gendered mannerisms and expressions
Gaiman has stated that they don't really

116
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.800
know what gender is about but they do
their best to emulate it to their own

117
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.199
understanding humans are weird and
that's how it works I knew that

118
00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:24.240
ironically this may actually be an
instance where homosexual actually would

119
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.199
apply but even that depends entirely on
if homosexual is compatible with asexual

120
00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:34.159
homoromantic but again in terms of
gender non-conformity the gender of one

121
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.719
person is not relevant to describe the
attraction to another out of all the

122
00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:42.240
psychological terminology that came out
of the 1800s that has become archaic why

123
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.279
are we still holding on to these terms
as if our personhood depends on them

124
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:50.480
don't answer that I I I know why I've
tried to make that video like seven

125
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.200
times now you know how God likes sevens
however instead of engaging in a debate

126
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.200
about how we identify Cosmic beings
trying their best to humanely live their

127
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.040
their best eternities Gaiman simply
avoids the discussion altogether not

128
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.720
that he excludes queerness from a
reading of these characters they're

129
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.480
certainly not straight but their place
in queerness is not worth categorizing

130
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.800
Beyond queer not even LGBT because they
fit none of those categories the first

131
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800
season of good Omens was a show that had
a couple our angel and demon of some

132
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.519
Renown at the center of it though no
confirmation came in season one anyone

133
00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:29.600
with a brain could see it and season 2
became a queer show and in order to

134
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.360
deter an investigation from Heaven
Crowley and airell need to Stage a love

135
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.800
story Maggie is a lonely record
saleswoman who has a strong crush on nah

136
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.920
the overworked owner of a cafe nah
however is already in a relationship we

137
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.959
never meet her partner but through text
messages we have a clear indication that

138
00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:49.480
not everything's coming up Rose is there
Nina's girlfriend is so intensely

139
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.399
jealous it likely crosses into emotional
abuse we aren't put on any kind of

140
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:58.320
pedestal here we have the same kind of
relationship problems that straight

141
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320
people have however as much as Maggie is
Lovesick and nah is stressed out over a

142
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.839
relationship that turns into a messy
breakup neither of them are defined by

143
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.440
their attraction to the other their
personhood is primary over their

144
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.560
queerness and neither are justified by
romantic attractions Nina smartly

145
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.680
decides that immediately after a breakup
is not a good time to get emotionally

146
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.480
invested with another woman which is
sound psychological advice coming out of

147
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.079
Fantastical queer fiction good on you
this is secondary only to the romance

148
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:32.480
between aerail and Crowley which is
split up in the end because the Damned

149
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.040
Angel suddenly gets a heart on for a
promotion you idiot we could have been

150
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.760
us gaimon has smaller roles for
queerness as well a sketchy Scotsman

151
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.320
openly professes that he uses his phone
only for grinder and the owner of a

152
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.639
magic shop references an anniversary
with his partner who he brings to aerl

153
00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:56.560
Street Business Association meeting
partner being an apt genderless

154
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.600
descriptor because his partner is
visibly androgynous in fact throughout

155
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.320
the season characters typically stick to
non-gender descriptions of relations and

156
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.120
individuals something that I imagine
most people wouldn't even notice unless

157
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.000
they have it pointed out to them and
considering that neither angels nor

158
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.399
demons have gender in the first place
the romance between be's abub and

159
00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:20.600
Gabriel would be queer in spite of their
actor's genders as far as what I've read

160
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.839
of gaimon's works this seems to be by
far his queerest and well I'm not

161
00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.399
complaining this level of brazen
in-your-face queerness is a a little bit

162
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:32.560
out of character for

163
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.200
him though he does his best to quietly
present visible queer identities without

164
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.120
making a big fuss about throwing in
surprised lesbians he likes troubled

165
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.480
lesbians and people without genders one
of the greatest strengths of Gan as a

166
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.120
writer is his signature quiet Nuance in
Pros even when he's conveying important

167
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.880
messaging or perhaps in regard to queer
representation he may not have realized

168
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.240
just how important that was beginning in
Sandman there is of course desire in the

169
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.519
fictional world of Sandman in
conjunction with the actual deities of

170
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:05.880
our human history there exist seven
beings who represent Universal aspects

171
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.360
of The Human Experience they are shape
shifters whose physical appearance

172
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.199
changes depending upon who is observing
them certainly makes it easy for artists

173
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:16.839
and casting directors functioning as a
family of siblings rather than a proper

174
00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:21.320
Pantheon they are called the endless and
endless though they may be there is an

175
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.959
order to their births Destiny the eldest
predates the existence of all life and

176
00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:30.639
functions as a constant for all things
in the universe and Cosmic Realms people

177
00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:34.440
beings deities and celestial bodies
whereas the other endless except for

178
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.760
perhaps death have limitations on their
Authority death is the second visually

179
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.360
inspired by cinnamon Hadley death
existed the moment the first living

180
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.720
thing was born and will vanish when the
last living thing closes its eyes makes

181
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.240
sense as death represents the cosmic
determinism of all living things in

182
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.720
spite of her simple Gothic appearance
her manner is more akin to a death Dua

183
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.760
or paliative care nurse and while she is
a universal her only rule is that all

184
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.680
things end but can be flippant about
when that happens dream the central

185
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.600
figure of the Sandman series though not
always the protagonist was born next he

186
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.079
represents higher thought processes that
living things experience mostly

187
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:13.399
imagination dream's domain seems to be
where reality and Imagination intersect

188
00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:17.399
what from The Real World is brought into
his realm and how things from his realm

189
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:21.440
can become reality and how everyone is
 if he isn't running a tight ship

190
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.560
gods and other deities are suggested to
have derived from dreams realm or not

191
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.560
it's fairly vague probably deliberately
the next is referred to to as the

192
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.800
prodigal who has been wandering for some
time and almost nobody knows where he is

193
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.839
younger still are the twins desire being
the secondary antagonist of the Netflix

194
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:42.480
series The behind the-scenes string
puller of all things disturbing

195
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.480
desire was and has remained non-binary
though back in the day desire was

196
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.680
referred to as it rather than they them
in the Netflix series in a mythological

197
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.680
and literary history of depicting the
personification of lust and sex as a

198
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.839
contemporarily beautiful woman this
speaks to a masculine Centric Society

199
00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:02.880
where the only individuals for whom
desire matters is men to make desire

200
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.399
either or any gender would exclude the
people for whom that particular

201
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:09.680
expression of physical beauty is not the
object of desire there's also an

202
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.800
argument to be made that might suggest
that desire's pronouns are better as it

203
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.040
because desire and fetishization are
dehumanizing but desire the character is

204
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.720
also the personification of even
nonsexual desire if you want something

205
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.199
or anything no matter how badly this is
desire's realm desire's twin is despair

206
00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:32.680
kind of a younger twin it's complicated
despair is the personification of

207
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.040
exactly what she seems to be the gateway
to her realm is mirrors and her sigil is

208
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.920
a hook very fitting visual indicators
the youngest of the Endless is delirium

209
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.279
who was born Delight again it's
complicated and everyone in the family

210
00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:48.759
respects both desire's pronouns and
deliriums name change it's difficult to

211
00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:52.360
say how faithful Sandman will remain to
its source material we only have one

212
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.120
season adapted from two story arcs and a
large number of the comics are one-off

213
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.519
stories about humans who encounter the
endless though the streaming series was

214
00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:03.360
exceptionally true to the comics
published three decades prior and I'm

215
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.759
sorry to you Neil if you're watching
this for my overuse of words and phrases

216
00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:12.399
like years decades illustrious career
long ago inspiration for new generations

217
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:15.959
plural I don't really like thinking
about how long ago Jurassic Park was

218
00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:21.000
released and how I saw it in theaters
but it's important to recognize the

219
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
historical context for how these queer
ideas were being not only teased but

220
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.040
explored in intense taken for granted
ways at a time before the majority of

221
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.920
the viewer base of this video had even
been born sorry again Neil whereas today

222
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.279
we have an almost direct adaptation of
Sandman via streaming and it is deced as

223
00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:41.319
pandering to wokeness whereas it's
basically just the same as it was in the

224
00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:44.880
comics with just a bit more gay though
that said I have a feeling that Gman was

225
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.959
treating the Netflix adaptation as an
opportunity to give Sandman a go over

226
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:53.079
and bring even more of his initial
Vision to life there is an expressed

227
00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:57.519
comfort with casting black actors for
roles that had been white in the comics

228
00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:01.920
and with showcasing a deeper expression
of the queer experience sorry bro these

229
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.079
teeny tiny sunglasses stay on during sex
then that's okay I'm okay with

230
00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:13.240
that honestly not so Ambiguously Camp
men wearing blackout sunglasses to

231
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.079
conceal weird eyes seems to be a
fixation for gaming and ocular F similes

232
00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:22.319
in general it seems as if all of the
base content from the first two arcs of

233
00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:25.360
Sandman made it into the first season
changes made to this content were

234
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.959
primarily a matter of streamlining the
existing information pacing was smoothed

235
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:32.160
out or characters were altered or
combined to fit into roles that serve

236
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.120
the plot better John Constantine was
altered into Joanna Constantine riffing

237
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.120
on the fual 18th century character in
later Sandman stories Hector and Lia

238
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.920
were repurposed so that Lia could occupy
a larger role and to allow for more

239
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.560
connecting tissue between characters
Rose's mother was the only character cut

240
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.920
from the plot with laa now occupying
much of that role instead laa absolutely

241
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.680
needed to be here because that dream
baby is important the nightmares brute

242
00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.199
and glob were replaced by another
nightmare are entirely G this is the

243
00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:03.720
most significant change as it portends
directly towards character development

244
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.360
for dream that was not present in the
comics at all or at least development

245
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.439
that takes much longer in the comics
it's worth noting however that there is

246
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:15.919
simply much more Sandman content in the
Netflix series than the corresponding

247
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:20.439
Comics the existing narrative was beefed
up to flush out a whole season unlike

248
00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:24.760
the Final Fantasy 7 remake however the
padding here doesn't seem as apparent in

249
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.679
fact if you're reading the comics after
watching the series you may find that

250
00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:30.480
some of the most outst ending moments
are missing allog together the padding

251
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.679
in the series outside of the adjustments
I mentioned earlier mesh so well into

252
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:38.200
the Netflix adaptation because they seem
to be flushing out side plots that

253
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.480
simply were never explored in the comics
though strongly indicated and it may

254
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.130
shock you to know that these expanded
indicated plots were about queer

255
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.189
[Music]

256
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.159
people yes desire slays and the
Corinthian was always gay leaning but

257
00:17:57.159 --> 00:18:01.280
offhand inferences and inuendos and the
comics received a strong followup in the

258
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.960
series not to say that they weren't
there but Rose's foyer to a drag Club

259
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.840
was only really suggested in the comics
whereas Netflix gave it an entire

260
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.280
musical number in drag I mean if you're
going to cast John Cameron Mitchell why

261
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.320
not and not all the praise goes to gam
Alan heinberg was brought on as a

262
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.760
co-writer for the series you can learn
more about him in the power couples

263
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.640
video from February of forever ago
heinberg himself is an openly gay writer

264
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.559
with a Strong pedigree in both comics
and screenwriting giman has always

265
00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:31.559
expressed an open to queer depictions
but the Netflix series likely with the

266
00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:37.120
help of heinberg expanded them a little
or a lot Additionally the gender swap of

267
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.039
Joanna Constantine which was likely done
to sever this from any variant of DC

268
00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:45.600
adapted interconnected universes smart
move to avoid them at all costs at this

269
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.280
point also made her a lesbian a very
messy lesbian my favorite kind of

270
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.600
lesbian granted nothing about the story
was changed except the magical person's

271
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.600
gender yes there are some human elements
that are true to both straight and queer

272
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.480
relationships and that truth is people
are the diner sequence was also

273
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.880
expanded in general but primarily
featuring additional queer people very

274
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.000
messy queer people though certainly even
if we're depicted making mistakes we

275
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.080
ought to recognize that these are the
kinds of mistakes that straight people

276
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.400
also make rose has a gay friend who
Sexes the concept of inhuman masquerade

277
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.240
and consumption of identity in the
comics the Corinthian like to stick to

278
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.400
murdering gay men and while there were a
lot of gays to unbury making the

279
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.840
Corinthian more indiscriminate about his
victims and adding another gay side

280
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.720
character who just gets to be a person
was a comfortable correction though as

281
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.640
for the Corinthian in general we have a
Serial killing monster who appears as a

282
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.919
gay man oughtn't that have costed a stir
in the queer Community I mean for all

283
00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:47.039
the real life serial killers and mass
Shooters who are straight white men our

284
00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:52.159
cultural Consciousness certainly likes
to hold on to the gay ones and the women

285
00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:54.960
this seems Rife for the kind of content
that would trigger our delicate

286
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.760
snowflake sensibilities especially in a
cultural Echo chamber for which the

287
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.159
choir sings you just can't say anything
anymore with increasingly vivacious

288
00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:06.840
intensity pitching a plot where the
primary antagonist is a Serial killing

289
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:12.039
gay Andor bisexual presenting man really
ought to have made the woke police put a

290
00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:16.039
stop to this you know I guess that's the
only underfunded police force if this

291
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:20.799
wave of apparent leftwing censorship was
as strong as critics to cry then Sandman

292
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:24.960
would have been purged from DC archives
and yet instead Neil Gaiman is held up

293
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.320
by a substantial queer fan base many of
whom celebrate him for exposing them to

294
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:36.559
certain areas of queerness in the first
place perhaps you can say anything

295
00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:44.520
actually and turns out that how you say
something and who you are to say it is

296
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.880
more important than what is said in the
1990s the Corinthian targeted gays

297
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.919
because police were almost certainly
never going to involve themselves in a

298
00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:55.400
rash of murdered vagrant gay men it was
playing on the reality of the situation

299
00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.480
in a very real way however cultural
sensibilities have since shifted but

300
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.120
still he himself is an instance of a
very very bad piece of queer

301
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.159
representation regardless of how we
human people can identify nightmares as

302
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:15.120
queer which may be gaiman's saving
Nuance here he is a monster taking the

303
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.520
form of a gay man to hunt them and even
though there are a few benign queer

304
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.640
characters in Sandman the deck is
stacked with morally gray or messy queer

305
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.440
characters not to mention desire's role
as the primordial demon twink my

306
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.640
apologies if twink is an unsuitable
descriptor for non-binary people but

307
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.880
I look at them I couldn't exist and
quite frankly to the anti-woke folks

308
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.320
they are right if this was your average
high budget built by committee TV

309
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.159
spectacle series these plot elements
would absolutely get shot down by the

310
00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:49.799
producers on paper these beats are way
too zesty media that explicitly

311
00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:53.440
villainized queer people is held to be
another component of language from the

312
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.400
1990s Executives aren't exactly known
for nuance so they tend to build blanket

313
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.360
rules for dos and downs and yet the
Corinthian and desire are still here and

314
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.360
people may be thirsty for them
regardless the diner lesbian with a

315
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.520
temper is here all of John Constantine's
male messiness is now Joanna's safic

316
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.760
messiness and still gaimon maintains his
staunch Bowie s queer following so if

317
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.440
the woke police did come for Gaiman what
was his get out of jail free

318
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:26.080
card it's conceptually
simple though actually quite

319
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.159
complicated
the simple explanation is you have to

320
00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:35.840
care a lot and Care is demonstrated not
something that you can just declare

321
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.000
politicians say they care about lots of
things but demonstrate very little when

322
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.559
it comes to problematic queer characters
and for those of us who are queer we

323
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:47.039
know many problematic queer people this
is not explicitly forbidden but it is

324
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:51.480
kind of taboo while Gaiman made a bold
start with Sandman he still had an

325
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.360
affectionate portrayal of an
indescribably queer romance and good

326
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.600
Omens generally speaking de
demonstrating positive queer folks in

327
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.279
one work will implore your audience to
read new ons into the messy queers in

328
00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:07.159
another regardless of just those two
Gaiman has been incorporating not only

329
00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:11.200
queer characters but even queer adjacent
themes into his body of work ever since

330
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.080
the most infamous outside of his ear
Fallen Crowley anyway was the notorious

331
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.880
deified gay sex scene in American Gods a
burnt out salesman from the Middle East

332
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.960
struggles with his time in America while
trying to Pedal goods for an ungrateful

333
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.880
family while in a taxi he relates to the
driver how hard it is to keep up a smile

334
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.960
in the land of opportunity the pair
become quite close through the ride the

335
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.480
cab driver it turns out is a Jin who
immigrated to America well provided the

336
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.120
lore of American Gods it was the idea of
a Jin who made the migration a different

337
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.520
version of the same iFit likely still
exists in his homeland it's complicated

338
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.120
anyway they smash turns out they're both
kind of equally dissatisfied with how

339
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.840
things are going the Gin is nowhere to
be found the morning after but has left

340
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.440
his taxi driver's identification on the
nightstand only now with the salesman's

341
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.919
face for the picture an opportunity for
a new life away from his oppressive

342
00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:08.279
family even though it's just a
disconnected vignette in a story it's

343
00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:12.200
still a heartfelt standout moment you
may be deceived into thinking this is

344
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.559
about being gay but it's actually about
being different and alone in a place

345
00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:21.960
with too many people especially in our
post 911 Western cultural stereotype of

346
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.360
the Arabian Peninsula it's significant
to make this the spot for graphic gay X

347
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.799
in this great American novel don't read
anything into it most of the Great

348
00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:34.679
American novels are written by Brits
it's important to remember that at a

349
00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.200
period of time when Europe was tying up
women and gay men and throwing them into

350
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.240
reasonably sized ponds to see if they
floated to the surface thereby

351
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.640
indicating their connection to
Witchcraft for which they would then be

352
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.440
removed from the water thoroughly dried
and then burnt at the stake that

353
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.360
Constantinople at the same time was the
cultural Progressive Hub of the world

354
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.399
scientifically culturally
philosophically artistically

355
00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:02.039
it also possessed a massive swath of
Europeans who had fled as refugees from

356
00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:05.159
whatever Inquisition Crusade or ethnic
cleansing was going on in Continental

357
00:25:05.159 --> 00:25:08.320
Europe at the time the reason why I
would say that this and other instances

358
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.120
of gaiman's queer Library perform so
strongly is that there's very little

359
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.159
sensationalism regarding these
characters that is he doesn't really

360
00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:21.880
make a fuss about queer characters where
we appear we're just there there is

361
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.159
nothing about the exchange that says oh
look gay characters they're just

362
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:29.679
characters and then gay stuff happens
sometimes but mostly they're just

363
00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:33.600
characters who contribute to what he's
trying to say the same purpose he has

364
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.080
for straight characters granted Gan also
includes eluded queer characters in his

365
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.679
books and generally I'm annoyed by
eluded characters however when Coraline

366
00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:45.200
is told from the perspective of a
9-year-old the protagonist isn't really

367
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.000
going to read into why the two bickering
elderly actresses in the basement flat

368
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.360
are living together again I'm only
opposed to the illusion of queerness if

369
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.399
it's a crutch used to present the
illusion to impressionable baby queers

370
00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:01.159
that they're being seen as Gaiman has
demonstrated a comfort level with queer

371
00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.240
characters the decision to imply that
these two characters are lesbians is

372
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.399
based off of artistic Vision rather than
an uncertainty about the audience like

373
00:26:08.399 --> 00:26:11.720
with yurian ice taking a moment away
from the narrative flow to specify that

374
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.640
these characters fall under the queer
umbrella would interrupt the underlying

375
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.360
themes if there ought to be a definition
of forc inclusion then that would be it

376
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.399
Coraline is about a child developing the
ability to recognize identity in other

377
00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:26.679
people this woman is my mother because
of EX this other woman who only looks

378
00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:30.840
like my mother is not actually my mother
and as it is a children's book having

379
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.960
more themes presented will detract from
what young readers are meant to take

380
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.640
away from it and this is part of the
consequences of being part of a

381
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.279
community that has been so gaslit into
believing that half- asked inclusion can

382
00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:45.880
qualify as representation any instance
of representation needs to feature that

383
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.600
rough gay sex scene or just doesn't
count there needs to be that soapbox

384
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.919
moment where the gay characters stand up
and make a Love Is Love Speech there

385
00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:56.720
needs to be that gratuitously horny gay
character who is either desperate for a

386
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.640
long-term relationship or hits on
everything incessantly to let the

387
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.320
audience know that he's gay do any of
you realize how many comments I still

388
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.440
get on the urion ice video to this day
aggressively arguing that the anime is

389
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.720
bad representation because you don't see
lips touching during the kiss then again

390
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.000
that video still gets comments from
usually straight women no hating but

391
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.360
still who incessantly deny that there's
any queerness coded or otherwise present

392
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.080
in that series the pressure to exist as
openly gay as possible in fiction has a

393
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.039
toxic translation to real life most gay
people people don't think about their

394
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:33.320
gayness and ways to perpetuate it
especially because these methods of

395
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.600
self-promotion as established in fiction
Focus around either having or trying to

396
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.919
get a committed boyfriend or persevering
over social pressures and persecution

397
00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:46.320
according to fiction the only two gay
Milestones that matter are coming out

398
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.720
and boyfriend and I have concerns for
this community if we are internalizing

399
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.840
these messages doubling back to good
Omens for a minute how is it possible in

400
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.679
this circumstance for these characters
to fit into clearly cly defined visible

401
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:02.960
representation they can't SL don't have
sex their genders are complete

402
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.919
anachronistic chaos and they don't
appear to experience physical pleasure

403
00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:11.039
kissing is a gesture neiler angels and
demons have a concentration of nerve

404
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.600
endings in their lips which result in a
pleasant sensation upon physical

405
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.200
stimulation you you make up the rules
about this so I'm just wondering what

406
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.799
would it take for these two to properly
depict gay or queer attitudes I highly

407
00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:26.840
doubt a cosmic entity would go on about
love being love especially when their

408
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.320
relationship revolves around the world
ending or not especially when the

409
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.159
majority of anti-gay discrimination
revolves around persecuting sexual acts

410
00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:38.760
however I would prefer we don't say that
this is bad representation because these

411
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.440
are two very queer characters involved
in a non-sexual romance and since

412
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.120
asexual people do exist believe it or
not I think that's pretty valid and so

413
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.360
no not all representation needs to be
about queer acceptance or normalization

414
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.760
sometimes it's nice to just see yourself
in a quirky character that isn't to say

415
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.559
that's all we need to be sometimes times
we really do need messaging directed at

416
00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:03.080
us and messaging that normalizes us Gan
also happens to have some of that too

417
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.000
though in Sandman no

418
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:13.799
less granted this is regarding a trans
character and as per contemporary

419
00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:18.519
discussions about appropriate trans
representation there are some pitfalls I

420
00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:21.519
wouldn't want to try and tell trans
people what is or is not good

421
00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:25.799
representation for them though from what
I've read people seem to feel generally

422
00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:30.600
positive about this one Possible season
2 spoilers ahead the game of you Arc of

423
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.279
Sandman follows Barbara Barbie from
season 1 who journeyed with Martin ten

424
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:38.840
bones to bring the porpentine to the
hierogram and who has since broken up

425
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.640
with Ken she is best friends with Wanda
who is helping her figure out how to

426
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.880
navigate New York City Wanda is trans
and though she never specifies to anyone

427
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.960
I am trans this becomes apparent
throughout dialogue cues Wanda is

428
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.120
talkative and we get a small glimpse
into her trans experience though she

429
00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.279
remains externally positive she trusts
Barbara enough to let her dead name slip

430
00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:03.559
though warns Barbara never to use it an
antagonist doesn't seem to approve of

431
00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:07.279
her though she can ignore him though
Gaiman is subtle enough to indicate that

432
00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.799
these bigoted remarks and encounters
have an effect on her and by subtle I

433
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:14.559
mean that she has a dream where Bizarro
aliens are forcing her to choose to be a

434
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:18.480
man or a woman decisions around gender
affirming surgeries are ultimately at

435
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.159
the decision of the individual to
undertake or not her dream indicates

436
00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:26.360
that she is struggling internally with
the pressure to make a commitment

437
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.360
through the progression of this story
Wanda's Womanhood is routinely

438
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.120
challenged because she is uncomfortable
with the idea of surgery at least at

439
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.600
this point in her life Wanda does die in
the story and while this may fit into a

440
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.159
buried queer Trope it's worth noting
that Wanda does not die because of

441
00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:44.960
bigotry she dies when her building
collapses in a freak hurricane which may

442
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.919
or may not have been caused by
witchcraft it's also worth noting that

443
00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:52.200
Wanda's death is not there to make the
CIS characters react or to make the

444
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.000
audience sad Barbara has already
undergone an emotional Arc and her

445
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.679
appearance at Wanda's Southern funeral
her only New York friend to appear is to

446
00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:04.880
pay respects and cross out Wanda's dead
name on her tombstone and write her name

447
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.919
over it in flamingo pink lipstick
however death has a different function

448
00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:12.799
in the Sandman Series where death is a
character herself and one may argue that

449
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:16.559
death functions differently in all of
gaimon's Works Gaiman in general is very

450
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:20.360
nonchalant about death even when a
character dies to propel the plot

451
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.159
there's very little sensation derived
from it sometimes people die in fact in

452
00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:27.039
the graveyard book most of the
characters are dead G and treats death

453
00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:31.000
in fiction as if it is not the end of a
character and this is very literal in

454
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.360
Sandman in this world most people who
die are taken by death to her realm a

455
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.399
place the panels do not take us we
understand that just like any other

456
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:45.799
character Wanda woke after her death and
was greeted by a compassionate woman to

457
00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:50.880
take her away but death is comfortable
bending the rules just a little bit very

458
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.600
Case by case basis Barbara has a dream
and she remembers from this dream seeing

459
00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:02.000
Wanda Wanda here in death is fully
feminized and no this isn't telling us

460
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.399
that death will make everything better
this is visual language to indicate that

461
00:32:05.399 --> 00:32:09.679
the cosmic forces of the universe
recognize your identity for who you are

462
00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:14.360
it's the same message of the entire
Sandman series emotional reality is more

463
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.440
significant Than Physical reality which
is a hell of a debate to include in a

464
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.919
comic book written by a CIS man like
holy can you imagine any of that

465
00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:25.080
happening today Mark the calendar and
count the days until Wanda appears in a

466
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.360
trailer for an upcoming season of
Sandman and people immediately to cry

467
00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.120
everything's being about trans stuff
these days however I did say that this

468
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.000
is a complicated process and gon
especially in the long long ago before I

469
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.080
read it would have had to have had some
real conversations with trans people to

470
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.799
really understand how to convey these
themes the best of intentions is not

471
00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:49.960
enough and in spite of Good Intentions
things can go arai a category of that

472
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.919
contains Thomas Harris in his novel
Silence of the Lambs the trans

473
00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:59.039
representation
is lacking

474
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.679
the movie especially because it offers
no insight into trans attitudes at all

475
00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:08.360
in spite of depicting the villain the
way they did would you me the book

476
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.080
actually goes to Great length to
describe trans women and in fact

477
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.399
exonerate them hctor goes so far as to
suggest that Jame gum cannot be trans

478
00:33:15.399 --> 00:33:19.320
because they are violent Harris
describes trans women as people who

479
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.480
transition to being women to live as
women and for no other reason but

480
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.559
regardless of the fact that Harris does
go out of his way to try and say the

481
00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:31.480
trans people are okay what is depicted
in the book sends a very harmful message

482
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.120
I would claim that Thomas Harris is
someone who is trying to do a good thing

483
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.760
because the novel contains unambiguous
language which declares that trans women

484
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.760
are not violent or antisocial without
exception even if he kind of failed at

485
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.440
presenting that this is what he wrote I
would contrast that with something like

486
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.279
Ace of vura which is actively malicious
belittling and hateful forgive the

487
00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:59.240
archaic phrasing but Hannibal says that
b is not not a real transsexual but he

488
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.919
thinks he is he tries to be he's tried
to be a lot of things I expect gum was

489
00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:08.159
described as a disqualified outlier who
fetishized Womanhood rather than someone

490
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.839
who felt that they actually were a woman
if that makes sense it doesn't really

491
00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:16.079
it's an e for effort situation really
because there is a lot wrong with this

492
00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:19.159
yes Harris seems to want to implore his
audience to observe trans people with

493
00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.599
more empathy while presenting a villain
who is trans identifying and without

494
00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:26.119
incorporating any other trans characters
into the story whatsoever not even to

495
00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:31.240
counterbalance bill this is all we got
and what protrans rhetoric there was in

496
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.760
the novel was not so present in the film
in conjunction Harris incorporates a

497
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.119
deeply triggering element of the trans
experience in the book assist doctor

498
00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:45.440
making claims about what does or does
not qualify as Womanhood there is a

499
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.679
precedent for Built Tough trans women
who have to pretend to be deeply

500
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:55.639
invested in pretty flowery dresses to
get past their doctors contemporary

501
00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.440
queer Theory and this is even presid in
gan's discourse around Wanda holds that

502
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.960
gender is self-defined the only
qualification to be a man woman or other

503
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.320
is for you to feel that way trying to
justify your gender to a medical

504
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.160
professional has been historically one
of the most arduous parts of the trans

505
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.599
experience even though I would not
recommend diying your endocrine system

506
00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:18.040
without a medical professional I feel
the onus needs to be put on the medical

507
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.240
community to establish more trust many
Physicians are working hard to mend this

508
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.160
Gap yes but there's still progress to be
made a lot Harris however is an torious

509
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.440
shut in it's clear that he garnished his
information from academic sources rather

510
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.839
than the living breathing component of a
culture if you're trying to represent

511
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:40.599
people then the people you want to
represent need to be where you start

512
00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:44.800
however good intentions alone cannot and
should not exonerate Herm that was

513
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.960
brought into the world so if just caring
isn't enough how much more complicated

514
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.480
does it need to

515
00:35:55.119 --> 00:36:00.000
be the more complicated ated reality of
good representation is that it's very

516
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.200
difficult cocktail of empathy as it
intersects with the willingness to

517
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.319
listen a compulsion to profess the
ability to reflect on certain people and

518
00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:13.720
situations there lies an ability to
isolate what elements of those

519
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.280
experiences are endearing to reflect
back upon those people while having an

520
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.480
understanding of what is or can be a
universal experience and what is or can

521
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.960
be fictionalized for instance when it
comes to men writing women there was

522
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.280
either not a a whole lot of attention
given to female characters in the first

523
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.839
place or failed attempts to understand
them Helen of Troy was attributed to

524
00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:36.839
having spurred manalus and sparked the
Trojan War because Paris of Troy was

525
00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:41.599
just so darn pretty that motivation was
so weak even 2004 as Troy had to develop

526
00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:45.520
an entire subplot about how menus was so
toxic that Helen's only recourse was to

527
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.720
leave with the first man who could
smuggle her out of Sparta men literally

528
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.079
have fictionalized women as accessories
to men because historically patriarchal

529
00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:57.079
values in society would Define that as
the role of a woman it was only in the

530
00:36:57.079 --> 00:37:00.000
last century or so that a woman could
open a bank account without a man

531
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.640
signing for it be it her father brother
husband or gay best friend for which he

532
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.960
would still have unbridled access to it
in much of fiction women spend their

533
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.280
time fussing over a man or dramatically
falling into his arms without any

534
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.560
personal goals or motivations except to
be with a particular man even

535
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.040
perceptively strong female characters
like Scarlet O'Hara in the end are

536
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.599
solely focused on a man that isn't to
say that you can't have men who develop

537
00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:28.480
excellent fictional women in history but
at the same time there is no guarantee

538
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.880
that women are going to write excellent
female characters either woman is not a

539
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.640
monolithic experience for which every
aspect of Womanhood is accessible to

540
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.480
every woman no one woman can embody all
the experiences within their gender but

541
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.079
when you belong to one particular
experience you may have an easier time

542
00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:48.119
extrapolating on different
manifestations of that experience I can

543
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:51.119
imagine myself as a different man
because those experiences are

544
00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:55.000
tangentially related to my experiences
it's not that it's more difficult per se

545
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.760
for a CIS man to write a female
character however it does require a

546
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.720
great deal more research empathy and
observation Stephen King is pretty good

547
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.000
at this there's a reason why his first
novel Carrie has become a regular in

548
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.960
feminist Theory classes and queer Theory
watch my video on deep cuts to find out

549
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.520
why he's also great at writing female
villains like with misery but when it

550
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.000
usually comes to villains well that's
rough especially in America audiences

551
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.119
tend to lean towards the idea that the
protagonist is the character whose

552
00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:27.280
values are meant to be emulated the
antagonist by contrast is demon

553
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.680
which typically holds that everything
about the antagonist is a problem and

554
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.280
ought to be shunned back to Gan how is
it that the weird queer kids flock to

555
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.079
him in spite of desire and the
Corinthian or other less than flattering

556
00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:42.440
queer characters especially when he does
not have a great deal of openly queer

557
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.680
Heroes the key there is that these
characters are villains because of their

558
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:52.000
objectives and motivations but they are
not villains because they're queer and

559
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.200
they are not villains because of their
queerness and it's true of most queer

560
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.760
villains lately too we're beginning to
make a comeback as villains because of

561
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.040
this not so simple trick and truly being
able to have a character's motivations

562
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.040
separated from their identity isn't a
talent every writer has though it's far

563
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.079
from the only important Talent out there
but for those who can deliver it

564
00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:17.400
generally makes for a better character
to have intersectional compartments of

565
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.599
their

566
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.400
personhood the secret to representation
at its core is not to represent end if

567
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.640
representation is the goal it's going to
suck the objective needs to be life the

568
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.280
author is not to look at themselves as a
Creator but a gatekeeper their role is

569
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.520
to allow identities to be found where
they are in real life to show the

570
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.200
hypothetical lives these people may lead
to create an imagined version of this

571
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.400
person based on the kinds of people who
live like this and it can't come from

572
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:55.319
nothing the best fiction is plagiarism
of life even if it's fantasy especially

573
00:39:55.319 --> 00:39:59.280
if it's fantasy because if your
protagonists are jousting on griffins or

574
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.839
discovering Ancient Aliens under the ice
caps the reader needs something human to

575
00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:08.440
grab on to they really can only truly
imagine something incredible the more

576
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.040
they can imagine a real person doing it
I highlighted the queer element of

577
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.400
American Gods very deliberately it was a
queer reference to a matter of a

578
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.640
pansexual deity that is very heavily
supported by documented historical

579
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.560
reality given the current day cultural
climate of this world that reality is

580
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:31.079
selectively forgotten we are disinclined
to portray or even remember that because

581
00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:34.920
it does not align with our present day
perspective of the world gaimon's

582
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.920
positive betrayal of queer people begins
with this he forces others to remember

583
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.079
what they willfully forget it seems to
be part of the quintessential queer

584
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:49.839
experience if others like me had existed
then others like me must exist now giman

585
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:54.119
works to spell out a Fantastical realm
of Dreams where reality waffles and

586
00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:58.400
Imagination runs wild all things are
possible because the only rules that

587
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.680
exist in this place are the rules you
bring to it we spend one-third of our

588
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.800
lives in this world of Dreams why
wouldn't we want to spend it all there

589
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.079
surely we can imagine a world where all
the Dow Grand challenges of our lives

590
00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:15.880
and societies become Petty grievances
that can be ignored we can be anything

591
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.720
do anything so much more than the
limitations of our own world where we

592
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:26.319
must share the dream of a sleeping God
our realities are at odds with other

593
00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:31.440
others and an absolute truth for one is
not an absolute truth for all however

594
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.960
there is a pivotal weakness to the
dreaming and a pivotal limitation to

595
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.839
dreams Powers though vast they may seem
dreams are lonely places when we sleep

596
00:41:40.839 --> 00:41:45.960
we are solitary save for the odd ghosts
drifting through through our dreams we

597
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.920
confront the possibility of what the
world could be the world as we would

598
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.920
make it if we could the world as we
would most fear it to become dreams

599
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.839
cannot be our reality because Dreams Are
Meant to reflect reality and we can look

600
00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:04.200
at them as Idle entertainment or we
could think of it like slipping into a

601
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.680
different existence in a change room
just to see how it looks though the

602
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.000
advantage of Dreams is that we can make
them real in a fashion we can take what

603
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.079
we like and work to make it true we can
ward off what we fear we can explore the

604
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:23.599
fringes of our imagination in a way our
waking Minds would dismiss as Idol

605
00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:28.200
fantasy the extent of the world we want
to create doesn't need to end in dreams

606
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.359
dreams are a mirror that can reflect the
future for all that we create our dreams

607
00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:37.920
without thinking it's still possible
though challenging to create our

608
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.160
reality though it is easier to create a
world we all dream of

609
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.880
together having a dream is not teasing a
reality that could never

610
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.440
be it becomes an
obligation to make it come
