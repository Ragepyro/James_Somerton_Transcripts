00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.800
Whenever I’m playing Overwatch, I’ve 
started gravitating toward Soldier 76  

2
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
when my favorite killer robot with 
PTSD, Bastian, isn’t practical.  

3
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.960
I didn’t play as Soldier for the first few years 
the game was out though. But then Blizzard, the  

4
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.400
company behind Overwatch, revealed that Soldier 
was gay and, well, I Stan a gay video game daddy.

5
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.640
But did you know that gay characters have 
actually been in video games for over 30 years?  

6
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.960
The first known game to feature a queer character, 
at least in the west, was MoonMist in 1986.  

7
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.880
More games like this popped up with queer 
characters in the years to come, mainly for  

8
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.680
the Apple II and the Commodore 64. Circuit’s 
Edge, and Caper in the Castro among them.

9
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.120
Nintendo even got in on it with Birdo, a character 
from the American version of Super Mario Bros 2  

10
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.200
who, in the game’s manual, was described as a man 
who likes dressing up and going by the name of  

11
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.320
“Birdetta”. They’ve, of course, done 
everything they can to pretend this  

12
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.960
never happened ever since because, 
well, Nintendo gonna Nintendo.

13
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.360
However, despite Japan’s seemingly 
inherent social conservatism,  

14
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.000
Most of the time, queer characters were actually 
purposefully censored for the West, mostly  

15
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.560
removing bits of dialogue from NPCs in games 
such as Phantasy Star II or Streets of Rage 3.  

16
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.120
In America, only adventure and computer games made 
direct references to queer characters early on,  

17
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.920
but they were often stereotyped. The first 
speaking role for a gay character, for example,  

18
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.200
was in the FMV game Dracula Unleashed, 
but the character was an overt pervert.

19
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.800
And that’s kind of how it stayed for a long 
time for Western gaming. Even in the late  

20
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.880
90s when the industry became dominated by the 
hyper heterosexualization of characters like  

21
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.440
Duke Nukem and Lara Croft. The closest we really 
came to queer representation was straight boys  

22
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.720
saying that hulking female villains in beat-em-up 
games were transgender. Or Cloud in a dress.

23
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.240
With some very minor examples in 
computer games that used the presence  

24
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.440
of a queer character to market the game 
as edgy and adult only, we mostly didn’t  

25
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.720
exist in the world of pixels and polygons. 
The modern video game industry as a whole was  

26
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:49.840
only about eighteen years old. But it was about 
to go off to college and start to experiment.

27
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.400
Early queerness in video games wasn’t 
really a... thing anybody was asking for.

28
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.080
Mario saving Princess Peach from Bowser 
was less of a dramatic or narrative option  

29
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.800
and more just a reason to have you play the 
game. Believe it or not, early video games had  

30
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.880
relatively little to do with romance options, 
in the era of side scrollers and platformers.

31
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.280
The advent of the RPG and turn-based fighting 
games meant that narrative games didn’t have  

32
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.320
to be done with text-commands anymore. There was 
a story, sure, and yes, if romance was a thing,  

33
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.520
it was going to be heterosexual. And nobody was 
really fighting for queer rep in these games  

34
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.800
because queer communities had 
other priorities at the time.

35
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.920
Namely… survival.

36
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920
And when it did come to queer representation,  

37
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.520
activists were pushing for being seen in much 
more visible media like television and movies.

38
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.280
So no. Gay developers and gamers and activists 
weren’t really pushing for queer representation  

39
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.840
in whatever JRPG you remember playing… Even 
though we showed up to show our support  

40
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.600
when the siren called.

41
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360
Through the gaming generation 
of Xbox and Playstation 2,  

42
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
there was a period of experimentation. This 
is back when moving with one thumb-stick  

43
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.040
and aiming with the other was 
a revolutionary new mechanic.

44
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.800
This also was roughly the same 
time that home computers became  

45
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.960
a ubiquitous necessity in households.

46
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.000
The early 2000s era of game development was when 
the industry was really figuring out how gaming  

47
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.640
was going to transition to a high-fidelity visual 
experience. Especially now that games could store  

48
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.720
audio information much more clearly than 
before — leading to game development  

49
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.600
that was able to record dialogue that 
matched the encroaching photorealism.

50
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.360
Retrospectively, developers might have argued that 
each game they produced was highly calculated…  

51
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640
but it seems to me that nobody was 
really sure of what would be a hit,  

52
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.440
and what would sink. These five, maybe 
10 years were met with an influx of games  

53
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.360
that were indicative of an industry that 
was still trying to figure itself out.  

54
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.080
Before the giant corporations started 
telling them what needed to be popular.

55
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.280
A large chunk of the industry kept 
trying to use mascot branding to  

56
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.920
sell E-rated games and wacky characters, 
most of whom would wind up in obscurity.  

57
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.400
A sizable chunk was trying to capitalize 
off of the success of Doom, Duke Nukem,  

58
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.080
and other gritty hyperviolence in an appeal to 
gamers who had freshly aged out of needing their  

59
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.440
parents to buy games for them. Very few were 
trying to push video games into the realm of  

60
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.760
interactive realism — which is where the 
industry believes games need to be today.

61
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.920
But before the major gaming companies 
really began to corporatize,  

62
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.000
there were a few… really weird ways 
that these developers began pushing  

63
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.480
the envelope. And though it may be a 
microtransaction machine these days,  

64
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.880
few people remember just how much of an 
impact The Sims had on the gaming world.

65
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.000
It was a create-your-character RPG RTS without a 
story. There was no narrative, no plot, no victory  

66
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.760
conditions — there were only game mechanics. 
Any story that existed was created by the user.  

67
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.400
And the objective? Just… exist. Buy expensive 
stuff. Own property. Get promoted in your career.

68
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.760
…Things that are still only possible 
in video games for millennials.

69
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.920
Who needs a retirement plan? I’ve got 
six mansions and a husband in the sims.

70
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.920
It’s not that games like this didn’t exist 
before this, it’s just that they were…

71
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.640
Simple. Straightforward. Either text command 
based, or choose your own adventure. And they  

72
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.400
always had a continuous, driving objective. The 
Sims had no objective. There was… no reason to  

73
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.680
play the game aside from having a good time. By 
all accounts on paper — there was no reason for  

74
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.800
anyone in management to sign off on this 
game. It was too simple to be bankable.  

75
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.280
The growing video game market was leaning 
towards action, challenge, and violence.

76
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.000
But it turns out people really liked being 
able to live in a house and have several  

77
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.760
friends and have a job where you could 
get promoted into being an astronaut.

78
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.760
And somehow, in this game, it managed 
to be possible for two sexy, ripped,  

79
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.880
pixelated men to totally get naked 
and get in the same bed together.

80
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.880
Was it design oversight? Someone slipping in 
a code? The design philosophy of the game was  

81
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.520
to be as unrestrictive to players 
as possible so… maybe it was just  

82
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.920
always intended to be there. Granted, 
same-gender marriage was impossible,  

83
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.160
but you could form romantic attachments to 
and move in with same-gender characters.

84
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.880
But the chief significance 
about gayness in The Sims  

85
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.920
was how little the game cared 
about whether you did it or not.  

86
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.120
It was just there. What’s even more absurd 
is the blending of child-like animations,  

87
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.560
mechanics, and all around sense of michivious 
fun with actual video game toons having sex.

88
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.880
Or at least the euphemism The 
Sims uses for sex: woohoo.

89
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.560
In fact, in more recent sims games, 
and the addition of more age brackets,  

90
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.880
even gay teenagers can woohoo. And 
yes, Gay marriage has been added to  

91
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.800
later games and even more customization 
around gender, and gender expressions.  

92
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.600
Choosing a male or female body type and selecting 
either or both sets of gendered clothing.

93
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.360
I have to wonder how things would 
be progressing without the Sims’  

94
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.880
lazyfair approach to gender 
pairings? Knowing how parent  

95
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.520
company EA feels about games needing to 
be ‘safe’ as possible to make a profit,  

96
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.480
I don’t know whether they’d be so open about 
this same approach if they had to choose now.

97
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.200
Can we really be aware of the doors 
the Sims opened up? Would we have gay  

98
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.520
characters in narrative games now, if it 
wasn’t for this everyday life simulator?

99
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.760
Four years later, you could find this 
same attitude towards gay coupling, though  

100
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.920
in an adventure game. Fable branded itself as… 
well, leading up to release, they said it would be  

101
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.200
many things to many people — legendarily 
— but it was not. Which sucks because even  

102
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.240
without the weird Lionshead promises, it was 
still a fun romp. Kinda half-baked, but fun.

103
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.760
We couldnt do everything lead 
designer Peter Moluneu said we could,  

104
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.400
But one thing you could do… was be gay.

105
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.080
In retrospect it seems a little problematic. 
You, the heroic protagonist, never spoke nor  

106
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.400
did you have a name. And any one who was 
available for marriage was a procedurally  

107
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.960
generated villager who was generally half as 
tall as you. Though still. This is a world where  

108
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.520
homophobia didn’t exist and that was nice. 
The second game was more or less the same,  

109
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.960
but with additional parenthood mechanics and 
very inconsistent rules about condom use.

110
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.560
But like I said this depiction did run a little 
bit… shallow. There’s generally no impact to being  

111
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.240
gay whatsoever. And while the fantasy is nice, 
the trilogy of games does follow a bloodline, so  

112
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.600
canonical heteronormative conformity is to 
be taken for granted. It would have been  

113
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.200
a bit nicer to have some queerness 
addressed by the plot, wouldn't it?

114
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.080
Maybe even queerness being related to the plot?

115
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.720
One could argue “well what were we going 
to expect for gays in video games?”

116
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.360
“What? Were you looking for games built around 
gayness? What kind of lib-tard nonsense is that?  

117
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.240
It’s not like straightness is a 
driving component of video games!”

118
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.120
So Kratos, an ancient greek spartan, can 
literally lay so many women he breaks  

119
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.040
the furniture, but we can’t have one 
game where being gay impacts the plot?

120
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.440
For some reason, this was a 
much taller order. Actually  

121
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.200
get a fully-written gay character who 
has meaningful contributions to a plot?  

122
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.280
Much less a fully voiced one. And perish 
the thought of it being a protagonist.

123
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.080
Thus rose the first cop-out of 
gays in gaming: The Gay NPC.

124
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.760
Not even the fem NPC who has a few 
auspicious dialogue interactions in an RPG.

125
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.800
Outside of the ambiguously camp Final Fantasy 
henchvillian, we did begin to see a rise of  

126
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.280
core-cast secondary characters who were 
either coded as queer, or who very subtly  

127
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.280
outed themselves, given the right dialoge options. 
Which… given that at this point, marriage equality  

128
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.840
was very much still up for debate in America, the 
fact that we even got this was a pivotal step.

129
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.280
And in all honesty, in many cases, it was 
handled very respectfully. But many of you  

130
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.120
may be surprised to know that one of the 
earliest (high-profile) examples of this  

131
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.280
came out of Star Wars.

132
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.800
Yes. Before Saint Abrams deigned to give 
us an exactly 3-second lesbian interaction,  

133
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:48.080
LucasArts served up this angsty, angry, claws-out 
catgirl. Who, if shown mercy after attacking the  

134
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.520
main character, can be recruited. And if said 
main character is a woman, can be flirted with.

135
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.960
And if you don’t show her mercy,  

136
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.440
another NPC alluded to be her ex 
gets REALLY mad at you later on.

137
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.280
Juhani’s queerness is subtle. And 
she can be sensitive about it if you  

138
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.800
pick it up too soon. But if you follow 
through with enough dialogue options,  

139
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.960
she does open up as a vaguely established 
romantic option... but only for other ladies.

140
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.200
Queer rep wasn’t a main staple of the Knights 
of the Old Republic series… or Bioware as a  

141
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.760
whole until Dragon Age many years later. But 
every other queer character in a video game  

142
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.320
would inevitably follow in Juhani’s footsteps. 
The NPC. In fact it seems shocking at all that  

143
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.360
even an allusion to a Juhani 
romance would be in KOTOR 1,  

144
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.200
given how queer characters were relegated 
to being side-characters played for laughs.

145
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.800
But it’s been a long 20 years.

146
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.520
A very. Very. Long… 20… Years—

147
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.680
And in that 20 years, the 
landscape of video games,  

148
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.640
both in terms of player-bases, accessibility, 
tropes, technology, development, and business,  

149
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.080
has shifted remarkably quickly. With the growing 
attention of prestige directed at video games,  

150
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.840
there’s been an increasing demand to see a greater 
spectrum of identities represented in games.

151
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.480
And for better and for worse, the industry 
leaders — trying to attract new players and  

152
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.640
tap into new markets — have been trying very hard 
to have queer inclusion without alienating a very  

153
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.400
dedicated (though questionabley sized) fanbase 
that loves to scream F** over the team chat.

154
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.960
So the game industry is trying 
to give representation without  

155
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.440
biting the hand that they think feeds them.

156
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.480
Which is leading to new problems and 
new cop-outs to have gay representation,  

157
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.840
while avoiding haveing anything that might 
be construed as outright gay representation.

158
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.520
From about the year 2000 and onward, video 
games went through huge changes. Specifically on  

159
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.240
the scope of what a game could depict, and how 
much information could be written into a game.  

160
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.640
Photorealistic textures, combined with 
increased processing power in consoles  

161
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.440
allowed ‘immersion’ to be a much more 
significant element of gameplay experiences.

162
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.720
Furthermore, the amount of storage space on disks  

163
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.880
allowed the branching-narrative style 
of text adventure games to easily  

164
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.320
translate into fully-rendered 3D environments. 
And this transition happened very quickly.

165
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.160
In branching-narrative games, entire 
sections could become inaccessible  

166
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.880
due to decisions you make. Dialogue options, 
going this place before another place,  

167
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.920
solving certain puzzles, and 
morality choices could determine  

168
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.640
whether a character died earlier, or was 
a reoccurring character. Like Juhani.

169
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.360
Knights of the Old Republic, released in 2003,  

170
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.520
was an early example of a guided 
narrative with branching options.

171
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.280
But other studios like Bethesda were pioneering 
open-world games like Daggerfall in 1996,  

172
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.760
and the much-beloved Morrowind in 2002. However 
in all cases, these games were massive in scope.  

173
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.920
So much so that most of the game 
would never be played by most gamers.

174
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.600
This is significant because… this is where queer 
representation could be hidden in plain sight.

175
00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.880
It would have made sense that queer characters 
would be more easily found in platform games  

176
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.600
which would take much less time to build, 
and whose focus would be gameplay mechanics  

177
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.160
rather than narrative ones. For instance, what 
would it matter if a fighting game roster had  

178
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.640
a character who was mentioned to be gay in the 
character bio? Most people never read that stuff!

179
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.720
And yet, in this world of massively 
expansive and expensive choice-based RPGs  

180
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.720
was where we found our first major 
representation. And… where we still  

181
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.960
find the overwhelming majority of our 
representation today. Game execs read  

182
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.000
the room and realized that gays flock to tabletop 
gaming and nerd culture like you wouldn’t believe.  

183
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.120
And the gaming industry also learned that the 
gays will flock to stores to buy copies of a game  

184
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.640
if a friend of theirs told them that there 
was a gay character somewhere in there.

185
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.000
Thus set a precedence for the most annoying  

186
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.680
one-foot-in instances when it 
comes to queer depictions in media.

187
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.400
See, immersion-based games function best where 
the player’s own personality is a component of  

188
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.920
the gameplay experience. You’re a soft, sensitive 
love-conquers-all type? There’s dialogue options  

189
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.440
for you. You’re a no-nonsense, any-means-necessary 
mercenary type? There are options for you.

190
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.680
I do think it’s hilarious though that developers 
allowed options to comit genocide and war crimes  

191
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.480
before they let us say yes homo.

192
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.040
This opened the door for them to sneak in queer 
representation to tap into a queer audience  

193
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.760
without explicitly offending the 
fragile sensebilities of big, tough,  

194
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.680
heterosexual ‘True Gamers’. If gay romance is 
an option… then there is an option to ignore it.

195
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.840
This is creating a very weird precedent in gaming 
and… well is something I’m becoming annoyed with.

196
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.880
See. If you have a character creation 
screen. And you create a black character.  

197
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.080
Is that developer committing to a 
game featuring black representation?  

198
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.560
No. They’re simply giving you the option. The 
game will not actually portray a black experience.

199
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.760
Instead, we look to the side-characters and quest 
companions for that diversity. Which, itself,  

200
00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.040
is problematic — as most of these games 
take place in sci-fi or fantasy settings.

201
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.240
Mass Effect is a culprit of 
this. You run into a problem  

202
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.880
where you have science fiction properties 
where the aliens are meant to be an analogy  

203
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.440
of ‘ethnic’ people, whereas the humans are 
the shoe-ins for Euro-American culture.

204
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.760
In fact it isn’t until Mass Effect 3 that the game  

205
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.840
clarifies that yes non-American 
cultures do exist in humanity.

206
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.720
The thing about having a gay romance option in a 
game though — where you can choose what gameplay  

207
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.880
experience you have — is that I don’t think 
we can actively qualify it as representation.

208
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.120
The funny thing is. We actually got queer 
representation since the beginning of  

209
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.360
BioWare’s progressively complex mission 
to present sex scenes to gamers on the  

210
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.800
brink of discovering masturbation, 
by having two rendered models of  

211
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.880
lifeless marionettes in painted-on 
underwear clipping into each-other.

212
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.200
Like I said, Juhani in Star Wars, but 
Liara of Mass Effect, who is from an  

213
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.520
“all-female” species, is a romance option 
for both genders of the player character.  

214
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.800
This… carries on in Mass Effect 2 where there is 
once again a couple of lesbian-inclusive ladies.

215
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.320
And no. It’s not her.

216
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.600
And not her either.

217
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.800
Which culminates in Mass Effect 
3 where there are a whopping  

218
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:15.520
5 bisexual-or-lesbian romance options 
next to… one… bisexual romancable man.

219
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.280
Which is laying the groundwork for 
another odd situation. In Mess Effect 3,  

220
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.000
there are more bisexual women 
than there are straight ones.

221
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Which isn’t me saying we need less 
lesbians or bisexuals in gaming,  

222
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.720
it’s me saying that developers are dangling 
lesbians on a string to titillate straight men.  

223
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.240
Bisexual women are especially appealing 
to developers because they’re under the  

224
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.600
impression that straight men 
fantacise about MFF threesomes.

225
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.400
But only when they have 
impossible waist-ass ratios.

226
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.560
It’s not representation if it’s exploitation.

227
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.760
And this is an ongoing problem in BioWare 
content, across Mass Effect and Dragon Age.  

228
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.120
Because even when they pat themselves 
on the back for having gay and lesbian  

229
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.200
exclusive characters in Dragon Age: 
Inquisition, they still have a much  

230
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.840
higher ratio of bisexual women, and a 
large cast of exclusively straight men.

231
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.560
(Mass Effect Andromeda is an 
exception to this rule and is  

232
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.320
the crowning highlight of the series 
— no I will not be taking questions.)

233
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.240
But when it comes to Bioware, is it really 
representation if you can opt-out of it?  

234
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.000
Despite the number of queer characters 
in BioWare games, it’s outstandingly easy  

235
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.400
to make a play-through that simply does 
not have queer characters in it at all.

236
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.880
In Dragon Age, You can kill Zervan before you 
talk to him. You can kill Anders at the end of  

237
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.560
the game, maybe he’s flirted with you by then? 
And both Dorian and Sera are optional recruits.

238
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.360
In the core Mass Effect, yes there’s Liara and 
other Asari, but other queer characters are  

239
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.000
generally out of the way or unessential. And for 
queerness, you have to dig for it unless you’re  

240
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.160
playing Andromeda and everyone is very keen to 
let you know that they want in your space pants.

241
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.560
In order for it to qualify as representation, 
I feel like it needs to do more than just…  

242
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.640
let us, queer gamers, choose to see ourselves.  

243
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.800
Seeing ourselves is important, but it’s 
also important to be seen by others.  

244
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.680
Representation’s role in activism doesn’t end 
with making queer content intended to be seen  

245
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.440
only by queer people. Representation has the 
additional goal of normalizing otherwise fringe  

246
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.360
identities. And bear in mind even suburban gays 
were considered ‘on the fringe’ not that long ago.

247
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.000
And identities cannot be normalized if:

248
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.160
They are unseen by hegemony-conforming audiences.

249
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.080
Or when They are depicted fetishisticly.

250
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.600
Choice-based sexuality has a 
lot of weird implications too.  

251
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.560
Primarily, the old tune that 
being gay itself is a choice.

252
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.280
Claiming that real-life people ‘choose’ to be 
gay probably isn’t going to be what most people  

253
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.520
take away from a gaming experience. But I don’t 
know how long the rest of you have been living  

254
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.720
on this planet, but people really do seem 
to have an aversion to thinking rationally.

255
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.480
Especially when it comes to 
straight, cisgender communities.  

256
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.520
Bear in mind this is the same group that set 
California on fire with a gender-reveal pipe bomb.

257
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.720
HOWEVER! Given just how common it is 
for homophobes to believe that being  

258
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.680
gay or trans is a choice, I’m not sure 
that we need to re-enforce that idea.

259
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.240
Another problem with choice-based romance options 
is that the sexual orientation of the protagonist  

260
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.960
is never really called to attention. 
Neither by other elements within the  

261
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.680
game nor in the ways these relationships pan out.

262
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.320
Well, Ignorable queerness in video games 
condones queer erasure while pretending  

263
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.960
to champion our rights. Take for instance the 
character Dorian from the Dragon Age series.  

264
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.240
Leading up to and following release, Dorian 
was pushed as a milestone for gaming — the  

265
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.960
first fully-voiced, exclusively 
gay man to be in a major RPG.

266
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.880
When you first meet Dorian — you can 
point-blank tell him you don’t want  

267
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.320
him around. And he’ll leave forever. Same with 
Sera, the exclusively lesbian character who got  

268
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.400
considerably less press despite the fact 
that she’s basically the only likeable  

269
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.720
and interesting character in that game. I 
feel in order to qualify as representation,  

270
00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.960
there needs to be unmissable, unavoidable 
queer character confrontation.

271
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.520
Other games have gotten around this by having 
queer side-characters. Very… small roles,  

272
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.760
granted. The Witcher 3, while… gratuitously 
heterosexual, opens up one of the first story  

273
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.200
quests by seeking out help from a hunter who was 
involved with a local lord’s son. Who ended up  

274
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.920
committing suicide because kill your gays. 
Later on, Geralt encounters a genderfluid  

275
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.000
elf as part of a mandatory quest. But b oth 
of these instances last about 5 minutes so…

276
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.840
That also kinda sucks because once again, it’s 
not that it’s ignorable but… it is forgettable.

277
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.960
Funny thing. The Witcher 3 spends a significant 
amount of time following Ciri, Geralt’s adoptive  

278
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.760
daughter. And while playing as her, there is 
a dialogue option to out herself as a lesbian.  

279
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.040
Which, the world of the Witcher 
is a little bit homophobic so  

280
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.960
approaching that so casually 
feels a little… forced?

281
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.240
Which reflects another weird problem 
around choice-based sexuality in gaming.

282
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.480
If you’re queer in any way, in the real 
world, things are different. It’s not  

283
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.480
always about discrimination — in fact, 
some things are better. Like not having  

284
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.600
your parents ask you when you’re going to 
get married or give them grandchildren.

285
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.960
...Well we USED to have that.

286
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.680
Congratulations to gay rights for removing our 
abilities to set boundaries with our parents.

287
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.320
There is a different, albeit subtle 
social feedback. While in a science  

288
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.160
fiction atmosphere like Star Wars or Mass 
Effect, it’s acceptable to say that this is  

289
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.040
a period of time when humankind has shrugged 
off hang-ups around sexual orientation.

290
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.280
(And yet it’s still more acceptable 
to boink an alien than another dude.)

291
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.440
In games like Dragon Age or the Witcher 
or other medeval-set fantasy worlds,  

292
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.320
there’s — apparently greater creative licence 
to depict extreme homophobia which is actually…  

293
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.320
kind of off and ironic.

294
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.200
So. Mass Effect takes place in a future 
version of this world. Which means that  

295
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.040
it’s a world which has endured racism, sexism, and 
homophobia. And yet, there’s a greater acceptance  

296
00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.480
that these are worlds where sexuality would be 
unrestricted, racism has more or less ended...

297
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:07.520
And yet, fantasy worlds are usually presented 
to us as other worlds. As in, their worlds never  

298
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.600
underwent mass-christianization. In fact, many of 
these fantasy worlds involve a form of polytheism.

299
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.560
Whereas, in our world the major reason why we 
have institutional homophobia — at least in  

300
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.720
Roman-derived cultures, is because 
of the Christianization process which  

301
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.080
prosecuted barbarian cultures for relatively 
liberal viewpoints on who can have sex with whom.

302
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.520
Homophobia in our world is arbitrary — but 
it’s even more arbitrary in fantasy worlds.

303
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.120
Which means that every queer character 
getting their moment where they  

304
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.640
step up on a soap box to harp about how love is 
love feels abundantly arbitrary. Or how their  

305
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.600
culture has super weird and uncommon ways 
of giving gay sex the stamp of approval.

306
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.080
Which, in spite of the gay persecution in fantasy 
worlds, nobody really… reacts to queerness.

307
00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.320
“Oh look there goes the Inquisitor. 
Commander of legions, advisor to empires,  

308
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.600
unparalleled warrior, and 
wielder of arcane secrets.  

309
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.880
He’s gonna go take it right up the butt 
from the giant bull man. Thumbs up.”

310
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.960
Because a huge portion of queer experiences 
is coping with the way that society changes  

311
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.560
it’s treatment of you. Either relative to before 
you came out, or to your heteronormative peers.

312
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.640
Your amalgom of gay romance pixals has to explain 
in great detail why their same-sex affections are  

313
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.920
valid and justified. But literally NOBODY else 
in the damn story makes a big deal out of it.

314
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.520
You could argue that there’s only so much 
content that developers can commit to,  

315
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.400
and that’s valid. But at the same 
time if gay representation matters  

316
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.000
so much to them why don’t they put the 
care into figuring out the little nuances?

317
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.400
Not that I’m calling for 
more crunch in the industry.

318
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.320
But depending on the degree of bigotry in a given 
video game, you would need to record duplicates of  

319
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.800
entire character interactions to appropriately 
capture the subtle ways that people treat queer  

320
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:03.760
or straight identities. Which may get impractical… 
But Red Dead Redemption 2 has a specifically built  

321
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.880
engine for animated horse balls, so maybe their 
attention could stand to be pointed elsewhere.

322
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.280
In the same way I struggled with Assassin’s 
Creed: Odyssey. Where you have the option of  

323
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.720
playing as a male or female protagonist. And how 
there was almost no difference in dialogue lines,  

324
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.120
or social treatment of the main characters from 
one gender or the other. While this is great for  

325
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.960
modern representation, Ancient Greece was one of 
the most misogynistic cultures in human history.

326
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.840
In ancient Greece — wealthy homes were divided 
into two sections so men and women would not  

327
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.880
interact with each-other. There was a significant 
seperation of sex-equality. To the point where  

328
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.720
ancient Hellenic myths about the Amazons depicted 
them so terrifyingly because the concept of a  

329
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.520
woman warrior was absurd. To be historically 
accurate, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey would have  

330
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.360
needed to be two games — and playing as a woman 
would have added a massive layer of difficulty.

331
00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.480
Which… would have been a cool way to have 
an easy mode and a hard mode. Especially  

332
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.320
because Ubisoft considered the Cassandra 
character to be canonical. And you know,  

333
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.440
being a straight man of privilege with a good 
body is pretty much god’s easy mode as it is.

334
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.960
Granted it makes a little more sense in Valhalla, 
where Vikings held masculine women, effeminate  

335
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.120
men, and queerness in much higher esteem. Even 
though Valhalla also has the additional problem of  

336
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.320
seeing straight and gay romantic 
interactions as being interchangeable.

337
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:31.360
So yes… being a gay person and having experienced 
homophobia… these relatively shallow depictions  

338
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.560
are a little bit irritating. And for me, 
they break the immersion a little bit.

339
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.600
A weird saving grace is a property like 
Skyrim. Which is not shy about existing  

340
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.000
almost entirely detached from this world. 
And you can just walk right up to Farkas  

341
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.760
with an Amulet of Mara and marry the 
big dumb werewolf boy and adopt kids.  

342
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.320
It’s so comically simple. There’s literally no 
social hang-ups over gay marriages. Same thing  

343
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.120
in Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4. It’s just 
a thing you can do. NPC companions don’t really  

344
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.640
have a different way of interacting with men 
than they do with women. Why would they? They’re  

345
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.160
living in the apocalypse! But we’re living 
in the apocalypse too, so what’s our excuse?

346
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.320
But even in science fiction post-utopias,  

347
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.640
this feels a little off. In the same way 
that every non-human species in Mass Effect  

348
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.720
refers to everything by acronyms derived 
from English. In the same way that feet  

349
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.280
clip through the ground when a character walks up 
a ramp. We need some kind of connection to this  

350
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.320
world to remind us that it’s based on our 
world. It just feels a little… too smooth.

351
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.120
And maybe this is our future, but for us 
in this world, we like our wish fulfilment  

352
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.240
with a little bit of context that acknowledges 
the world that we, the audience, live in. We,  

353
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.560
after all, continue to struggle with problems 
in queerness. And not all of our problems are,  

354
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.280
as the cis-het developer management beleive, 
about battling homophobia. Within queer spaces,  

355
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.040
we face a number of problems that 
have very little to do with bigotry,  

356
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.680
but rather existing in a world that is primarily 
designed for baby-rearing heterosexual coupling.

357
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.480
Once again, Andromeda was much 
better at setting up this context.

358
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.120
In Andromeda, certain same-sex relationships 
didn’t face homophobia, but they did address  

359
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:08.080
gay problems. Specifically, in the romance 
with the exclusively gay character Gil Brodie,  

360
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.720
a large portion of it is built around the 
question of surrogacy and shared parentage.  

361
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.200
And it just feels like the writers spent some 
actual time thinking about what elements of gay  

362
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.880
relationship hang-ups would carry over into 
a society that had largely shed homophobia.

363
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.360
Which is the next problem with 
choice-based queerness. Queer relationships  

364
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.560
are different than straight 
ones. Not even in a bad way.  

365
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.240
It’s just a matter of gender roles. Even if 
you pretend that society has not developed  

366
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.080
with any pre-existing framework that favours 
heterosexual coupling over homosexual ones.

367
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.200
Two men interacting with each-other romantically 
is going to be different from the experiences of  

368
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.280
one man and one woman together. Which will, 
in turn, be different from how things would  

369
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.800
work with two women, or a pairing that involves 
a nonbinary person, or a polycule of any size.

370
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.960
But when you have bisexual characters in games, 
their dialogue lines are exactly identical,  

371
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.960
barring pronouns. Their treatment of the main 
character is identical. There’s no functional  

372
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.840
difference in how this relationship works. Which… 
maybe that’s how it’ll be in the future. But for  

373
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.760
now, most accounts I’ve heard from bisexual 
people in relationships is that they can  

374
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.600
sometimes have vastly different mechanics 
depending on the gender of their partner.

375
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.360
This is true even if they have no 
specific preference for any gender.

376
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.760
It’s all other peoples’ bullshit. You 
just learn to adapt to it differently.

377
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.960
But wouldn’t queer people in narrative 
games kinda solve all these problems?  

378
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.880
Every single one? Confrontational representation?  

379
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.680
Controlled queer expiriences? Creating a 
narrative statement on the state of being queer?

380
00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.520
It might not be too far off that 
we start seeing some of that.  

381
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.080
Games which no longer present straightforward 
and cis-hetero romantic expectations. And,  

382
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:49.840
more importantly, present a kind of 
queerness you can’t look away from.

383
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.040
The main concern that I have when it comes 
to depicting gays in… media in general is:  

384
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.560
“Can it be ignored?”

385
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.720
In film and television, it’s a matter of 
deconstructing the coding, or gauging what  

386
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.720
value a random gay kiss has to the overarching 
plot and if it’s something that could be  

387
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.600
hypothetically removed so that it can get screened 
in Russia or China. But at the end of it all,  

388
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.080
I really am having a discussion 
about visibility in media, aren’t I?

389
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.160
How visible are we? Again, can we be ignored?

390
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.040
Many times where we are told 
something has queer representation,  

391
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.040
the queer people are made invisible  

392
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:31.920
somehow. We are told we are represented. We are 
told we are seen. And yet, we do not feel seen.

393
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.560
Video games are a challenge to this model because 
in many ways a video game bypasses directorial  

394
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.360
intent. Video games, in many cases, are used to 
tell non-linear stories. And even when they are  

395
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.080
linear, a game experience can change vastly 
depending on how a player approaches certain  

396
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.280
challenges, what pieces of lore are missed or 
how deeply a player engages with visual elements.

397
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.360
Giving the player the choice whether or not 
to engage with the game’s story and lore  

398
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.080
is becoming oddly commonplace in the industry.

399
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.360
This is abundantly clear in games 
like the Soulsborne franchise.  

400
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.120
Details about the world and even 
the plot are never really clear.  

401
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.520
You can go along in the game and just do what 
NPCs tell you to do. Depending upon what you  

402
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.400
do and who you speak to in the game, you may 
or may not have a clue as to what’s going on.

403
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.720
Whereas that’s much more difficult to do 
in linear media, where everything you see  

404
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:24.560
is the way it is because it was crafted to release 
information, emotions, and visuals in a specific  

405
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:33.360
order. It’s not impossible. For instance there are 
films like Citizen Cane, Memento, or Pulp Fiction  

406
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.560
that rearrange narrative chronology so that 
information can be withheld from the viewer,  

407
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.760
and things become more clear 
after the whole film is seen.

408
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.320
Even movies like Black Swan that don’t play 
with chronological structure accomplish  

409
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.840
this by both obscuring details and forcing the 
viewer to question what is and is not reality.

410
00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.400
Leading to you, the viewer, developing your 
own opinion of what events are occurring.  

411
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.560
The same is very true of Soulsborne-style 
games — where world-building is done  

412
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.040
primarily through reading 
the descriptions of items.  

413
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.360
You pick up scraps of inference and 
strong hints about the world you’re in.

414
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.800
And this is important, believe it or not, 
for framing a discourse about what queer  

415
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.000
representation in video games can look like. 
Because this feeds into the problem of whether  

416
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.760
a queer side-character in a video game can 
be accurately described as representation.

417
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.560
And the answer is… they usually can’t.

418
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.480
Side-characters in films are elements of the 
story. This is true for video games also, but  

419
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.240
story is only one component of a video game, and 
sometimes… isn’t the primary draw for a video game  

420
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.560
and can be (and maybe sometimes 
should be) ignored completely.

421
00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.240
And if the purpose of representation 
is to normalize fringe identities,  

422
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.720
then confrontation is necessary.  

423
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.200
Which means queer characters need to be an ongoing 
and clearly defined element of the narrative.

424
00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.000
Which… the gamer bros are going 
to complain about that but  

425
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.480
they complain when even optional gay characters 
aren’t just there to be a punchline so  

426
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.880
let them complain. Let us not give 
a shit about the opinions of idiots.

427
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:15.200
That said, a good way to make a game 
undeniable queer is to just to… you know…  

428
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.560
make the main character queer.

429
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.520
The Last of Us 2 didn’t really make history 
as the game with the first gay protagonist,  

430
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.520
but it was indeed the first to come out of a major 
studio. And it was met with an incredibly divided,  

431
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.080
and often harsh, response from fans of 
the first game who didn’t like that this  

432
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.360
game killed off a man for no other reason 
than the emotional development of a woman.

433
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.720
… How’s it feel guys?

434
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.040
Never-mind that Ellie as the protagonist was 
something set up from the prior game and that it  

435
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.600
wouldn’t have mattered if they killed Joel or not, 
these same shit nuggets wouldn’t have had anything  

436
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.240
nice to say about it anyway. And while Ellie’s 
sexuality is certainly an element of the plot,  

437
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.240
it is only tangentially related 
to the progression of the story.  

438
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.680
As in, Ellie’s bisexual girlfriend 
is pregnant from her ex-boyfriend and  

439
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.600
that is addressed as Ellie goes about her 
revenge mission. Which is the main plot.

440
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.840
But it’s not like her queerness is defined by 
having to escape an extremeist cult that is  

441
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.160
trying to kill her for being queer. Surely 
we’re moving past the point where queer  

442
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.360
characters can only resolve conflicts that 
relate directly to combating bigotry, right?

443
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.080
And this… is the part of the video where we 
talk about the highs and lows of The Last of  

444
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.360
Us 2’s queer rep. Yes. Ellie is out and proud 
and her queerness has nothing to do with the  

445
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.840
progression of her plot. And honestly that’s 
what we’re looking out for. At least I am.  

446
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:41.760
Because when it comes to expensive media projects 
— usually, our queerness is the plot. Queer media  

447
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.240
is about queer people whose queerness is 
the driving conflict of their queer story.

448
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.120
It’s been the only story we’re allowed to 
inhabit in mainstream media since… ever.

449
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.040
But we’re moving into a generation of 
queer creators who are so completely over  

450
00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.080
‘the gay plot’ that they’re crafting 
stories in which sexuality is irrelevant.  

451
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.680
Where these stories are not ‘queer stories’ — 
but instead, stories experienced by queer people.

452
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.480
Ellie’s on a revenge quest. It’s not even revenge 
for the gay bashing of a girlfriend. It’s a more  

453
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.680
universal story about the human condition. For 
which there are plenty of straight versions.

454
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.720
But the elements of the story around 
character, and character interactions,  

455
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.560
are slightly modified because 
one or more characters are queer.

456
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.200
Abby’s story falls into the problem of 
‘the queer victim.’ Abby is Ellie’s rival  

457
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:33.040
and a POV character in the game. She herself is 
not gay, or nonbinary she’s just… really jacked.

458
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.000
When you start out with Abby, 
one of the first things you do  

459
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
is save a post-apocalyptic trans 
man, Lev, from a post-apocalyptic  

460
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.760
religious cult that — go figure — hates 
trans people for no discernable reason.  

461
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.720
Abby’s story is almost entirely built around 
surviving Ellie, but also helping Lev survive  

462
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.440
this cult who keeps trying to kill him. 
Sometimes she has to save Lev from Ellie.

463
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.520
Ellie doesn’t wanna kill him because he’s trans,  

464
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.040
but as part of her mission to 
kill Abby and all of her friends.

465
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.920
Still, this turns into one of many instances 
where, because media needs to be so thoroughly  

466
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.760
framed from and for the perspective of privilege, 
that a story about queer identity becomes a story  

467
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.000
that focuses more on anti-queer bigotry. 
Just like how a lot of black-framed movies  

468
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.560
made by white people focus more about the 
racist people’s journey into acceptance.  

469
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.960
Coming from privilege, it’s very easy to 
make a story about bigotry and focus on  

470
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.080
the bigoted people’s feelings and justifications.

471
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.320
And there have been other critics of The Last 
of Us 2 who claimed the game seems to validate  

472
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.760
queer identity on the ability of queer people 
to endure suffering. Which even though Ellie’s  

473
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.360
story isn’t necessarily queer, she is a queer 
person, and her entire story is about enduring  

474
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.680
immense amounts of suffering 
and trauma. Gratuitously so…

475
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.240
It’s unfortunate that we have a game in 
which, even if Naughty Dog didn’t make the  

476
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.720
claims themselves, Ellie is perceived to be 
the first gay protagonist in a game and yet  

477
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.200
this game is so divisive even among the queer 
community. Many of us having lived through the  

478
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.560
90s and early 2000s of gay media have reached 
a saturation point of gay suffering narratives.

479
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.640
It’s difficult to say on one hand 
that it gets better, but on the other  

480
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.280
hand celebrate a glowering totem of media 
about gays for whom it certainly does not.

481
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.560
Gays, these days, are tending 
to lean towards media that is  

482
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.840
queerly optimistic, or media where queer 
characters are either triumphant or where  

483
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.520
emotional growth is achieved 
in spite of romantic failures.

484
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.840
That doesn’t necessarily mean that The Last of Us 
2 is bad representation. I love that it doesn’t  

485
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.360
give the player a choice other than to play 
as a lesbian. And It’s far from a bad game,  

486
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.600
and Ellie’s story is still significant even 
as a queer narrative because regardless of  

487
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.480
whether we want media that depicts us outside 
of suffering, queer suffering still exists.

488
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.680
But as I’ve mentioned, The Last of Us 2 is far 
from the first game to depict queer characters.  

489
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.240
In fact when The Last of Us 2 swept gaming 
awards (in spite of the studio, Naughty Dog,  

490
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.600
demanding overtime from their employees, which 
in the gaming world is called ‘crunch’ and is  

491
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.040
exactly what you should not have needed to do 
if your game won ‘best direction’) — detractors  

492
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.720
who said that it shouldn’t have won 
were decried as being ‘homophobic.’

493
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.240
Which I feel like a lot of that came from 
allies who just assumed that if someone  

494
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.760
didn’t like The Last of Us 2 it was because you 
didn’t like that Ellie was a lesbian. Which…  

495
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.800
doesn’t really help a discussion of our 
representation in media because if someone  

496
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.280
doesn’t like the type of representation, there’s a 
perfectly valid discussion to be had about how to  

497
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:35.200
make it better. And by putting it on a pedestal 
that is beyond reproach, you’re going to paint  

498
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:41.520
the entire fanbase as a cult which actively 
denies any shortcomings the media does have.

499
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.760
No media is perfect and therefore, 
no media is beyond scrutiny.

500
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.160
Especially because many people saying 
The Last of Us 2 shouldn’t have won all  

501
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.600
the awards it did were saying that it should 
have gone to Hades instead. But The Last of  

502
00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.560
Us 2 stans mostly did not know what Hades was and 
doubled down and called you Homophobic some more.  

503
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.040
Completely oblivious to the fact that Hades is 
probably even more gay than The Last of Us 2.

504
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.720
It was just made by a small studio 
and has taken over a year to reach  

505
00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.120
the level of cultural permeance it has. 
But Hades is still getting fanart while  

506
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.480
the media narrative has largely 
forgotten about The Last of Us 2.

507
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.880
But make no mistake, Hades, a game set in 
the Hellenic underworld of ancient Greece,  

508
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.120
is incredibly gay. You play as the relatively 
obscure mythological figure: Zagreus, the god of  

509
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.160
cycles and rebirth. Son of Hades and Persephone, 
and sometimes is an alter-ego of Dionysus.  

510
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.240
Though in the game he’s just the sassy prince 
of Hell with a heart of gold and abs of steel.

511
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.960
The game’s story focuses around Zagreus’ quest to  

512
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.480
escape the underworld and reunite with 
his long-lost mother on the surface.

513
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.280
And on the way, he encounters a number of 
Olympic and Chthonic figures from mythology.  

514
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.240
The story both celebrates and subverts a 
number of tropes in Greek myth, and places  

515
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.600
itself in the historic context of life in ancient 
Greece, before modern homophobia existed. And as  

516
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.400
a result, nobody really raises an eyebrow at 
instances of queerness and sexual liberation.

517
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.800
For instance, both Achilles and Patroclus are 
characters here, and it’s no secret that they’re  

518
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.480
both depressed because they have to live in an 
eternity in hell apart from each-other. There is  

519
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:18.400
a significant side-quest about getting them to see 
each other again — and then they’re happy gays.

520
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.880
Happy gays! What a concept.

521
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.440
I mean they’re already dead, so it would be a  

522
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.880
pretty tough job for writers to pull a 
kill-your-gays on us in that situation.

523
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.800
But Achilles even openly discusses his 
relationship with Patroclus with other  

524
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.200
residents of Hell, without any pushback. Nobody 
gives it any thought, and nobody questions why  

525
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.640
Achilles is so attached to another man. They’re 
not… very good friends. They’re boyfriends.

526
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.680
However, that’s not all.

527
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.600
Zagreus himself has a few romanceable NPCs.  

528
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.120
One of them, Megara, is more of a contemptuous 
hate-sex kind of deal. Frenemies with benefits?  

529
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.000
And the benefit is that Megara gets to peg 
Zagreus at her leisure. And it’s not subtle.

530
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.800
You know what also isn’t subtle? Thanzag.

531
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.440
At some point in your journey 
upwards, you encounter Thanatos,  

532
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.200
the god of peaceful deaths. 
Who is… not at all happy that  

533
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.280
Zagreus decided to leave without saying 
goodbye. And while it’s only inferred  

534
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.400
that they used to be an item, it certainly 
is not just inferred that they want to be.

535
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.720
I find it interesting that the NSA sex 
relationship in the game is with a woman.  

536
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.680
And the pining, romantic, ‘you make me feel 
so (not) alive’ romance is with another man.

537
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.840
Now… technically these qualify as romantic 
‘options’ and they don’t have any bearing on  

538
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:07.120
the main quest of the game. However, this is one 
of those games with a ‘secret’ or ‘true’ ending.  

539
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.080
Where, if you complete the 
social fetch quest of each god,  

540
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:16.640
you do get the true ending. And you can only 
get this by going through the gay romances.

541
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.960
Because even if you turn down Thanatos (which…  

542
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.440
I never have and I’m not sure if you actually 
can?), you still have to go through Achilles and  

543
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.240
Patroclus’ very drawn-out relationship 
drama. And also Theseus and Aristeus.

544
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.720
But even then, in spite of all of this, there are 
many who continue to refute Hades as having queer  

545
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.040
representation. At least, the kind of queer 
representation they want. And then proceed to  

546
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.040
scream at Activision for more queer characters. 
Which feeds back into the problem I mentioned.

547
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.400
When Blizzard, which is owned by 
Activision, canonically confirmed  

548
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.400
that the Overwatch characters, Tracer 
and Soldier 76, were homosexual…  

549
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.720
well you’d think it would have generated 
more of a buzz than it did. Overwatch had,  

550
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.240
for a few years, been the most celebrated 
competitive E-sport in the world.  

551
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.880
And taking the female character most 
sexualized by male fans, and the most stock  

552
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.160
FPS call-of-duty derived machismo character 
and making them gay — that’s quite a move.

553
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.320
But they were only confirmed to be gay 
in a cross-promotional comic book tie-in.  

554
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.920
And there are not any clear references to 
his sexual orientation in the game itself.  

555
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.640
Which… back to square one I guess. So big 
studios manage to squeeze in these little,  

556
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:29.120
ignorable details of queerness, and then media 
commentators on Twitter — queer-directed media  

557
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:35.200
commentators no less — treats it as if we have 
received a gift that we need to be grateful for.

558
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.800
Never-mind the slew of indie-developed 
games which feature queerness prominently,  

559
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.080
like Hades. Queer identity has 
flourished in visual novels,  

560
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.560
dating sims, and pixelated retro-style 
platformers. Indie games are usually made  

561
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.640
by incredibly small studios and in some 
cases may be run entirely by queer staff.

562
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.440
When we talk about representation in gaming, 
sure, we’ve got Ellie from The Last of Us 2.  

563
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.960
But we’re also going to re-open 
this discussion about Iron Bull  

564
00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.520
and how he somehow makes BDSM even more 
boring than it was in 50 Shades of Grey.

565
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.840
We’re almost never having a discussion about Dream 
Daddy, Life is Strange, or… Neko Jishi…? Which  

566
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.200
I’ve never heard of but I’m sure it’s wholesome.

567
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.120
But even though we got a bestselling 
tripple-A game that gave you no choice  

568
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.440
but to play as an out lesbian, and protect 
a trans man in order to finish the game,  

569
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.320
and we got a pro-queer indie game that was by 
far more successful than anyone anticipated,  

570
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.840
the future of queerness in 
video games is still uncertain.

571
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.040
In spite of a very recent influx of 
queer-inclusive gaming, I don’t know  

572
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.200
if we’re on the brink of a queer renaissance 
in gaming. I don’t want to cast any disrespect  

573
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.000
on many of these developers and studios, but 
of the examples listed above, only Naughty Dog  

574
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.400
is considered a ‘large’ developer. Due in part to 
how it at least functions as a subsidiary of Sony.

575
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.600
The other games, Hades, visual novels, dating 
sims, are produced by very small, very niche  

576
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.600
developers. These games are in no way meant to 
hit the big kind of broad-audience sales numbers  

577
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.680
like The Last of Us was expected and required to 
hit. Hades was this weird omnisexual anomaly that  

578
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.040
oversold in a way even Supergiant Studio neither 
expected nor were they prepared for. In fact,  

579
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.120
towards the end of development, studio heads 
were convinced the game would be a massive flop.

580
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.520
Who wants to be trapped in a hellscape where 
it is functionally impossible to escape?

581
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.880
Who could possibly identify with that scenario?

582
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.760
But then suddenly we were all trapped 
at home during a pandemic and we really  

583
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.640
identified with Zagreus’s attempts to escape hell.

584
00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.840
And yet, in spite of some very weird breakout hits 
like Hades and like Dream Daddy and Stardew Valley  

585
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:47.920
— whose sales numbers by far exceed many Triple-A 
games — there is a strong reluctance for studios  

586
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.120
to commit to these kinds of gameplay experiences. 
Not to mention, their queer inclusive content.

587
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.800
And as much as we, queer people, are 
represented in indie games and smaller  

588
00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.840
projects, a huge amount of the demand for 
queer rep is on larger studios. Which is…  

589
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.520
kind of immediately setting 
ourselves up for failure.

590
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.560
It’s like expecting a gay 
disney princess all over again!

591
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.360
Studios… aren’t inherently bigoted. 
Executives operate on two paradigms:  

592
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.880
follow the money, and break into untapped markets. 
They do what’s popular because it’s shown to sell.  

593
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.560
This is indicative of the slew of soft-palate, 
cell-shaded, nature-focused, anime-realism  

594
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.960
adventure games that started popping up 
about 4 years after Breath of the Wild.

595
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.360
If a trailblazer takes on a new format that ends 
up doing well, you can guarantee that others will  

596
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.240
follow. Not even always out of a need to ape on 
the popularity of a given aesthetic or mechanic,  

597
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.400
but also because smaller developers want 
to pay homage to inspirational games.  

598
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.480
Both of these instances are clear 
with the torrent of Dark Souls clones.

599
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.840
All this to say that, yes, studios and developers 
are interested in representing queer characters.  

600
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.440
If they can make a game that 
the gays flock to en masse,  

601
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.210
they’re more than happy to take our money. Same 
thing with women, characters of colour, disabled  

602
00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.600
people, and any combination of the bunch. And 
specifically in regards to queer representation  

603
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.960
and women leads, there have been marked strides 
in how well these games will draw in an audience.

604
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.080
However, as was discussed with The Last of 
Us 2, there is a risk associated with this.  

605
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.200
Though it’s grip is slipping, 
‘Boys-Will-Be-Boys’ sensibilities  

606
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.320
still dominate a significant 
swath of Video Game spaces.  

607
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.480
There are many cis men who celebrate games 
that feature women or queer characters.  

608
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.520
In fact, some people make a special point of 
playing the queer romance options in RPGs.

609
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.880
Regardless of the support, there 
is still a loud, if not large,  

610
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.440
section of the video game player-base 
who will stage petty boycotts and spam  

611
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.880
review sites with one-star ratings 
if a game has a queer character.

612
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.360
Would a Triple-A studio risk an original 
IP with this kind of boycottable diversity?

613
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.440
When it comes to female protagonists… 
it’s difficult to plot a pattern.  

614
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.800
Studios don’t seem to be able to 
pull in much money from exploiting  

615
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.800
big-boobs like with Ivy from the Soul 
Calibre series these days. In fact,  

616
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.280
fighting games seem to be the only place it can 
get pulled off. And even then that’s probably  

617
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.440
less about titilation for straight men and 
more about serving hot luuks for gay men…

618
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.280
Who happen to be one of the most 
significant markets for fighting games.

619
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.000
You’d think Mortal Kombat would have kept their 
first openly gay fighter around when they released  

620
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.880
MK11 since they patted themselves on the back to 
no extent when they released him in MKX. But no.

621
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.840
Though one could say that a lack of sexual 
availability is what triggers the bigoted gaming  

622
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.080
audience… Many blame Ellie’s controversial 
backlash less on her sexual orientation,  

623
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.120
and more on the fact that she presented a 
femininity which was not meant to depict her  

624
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.880
as available for the straight male gaze. This was 
a similar criticism for the Captain Marvel movie.

625
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.040
As well as the protagonist from another 
Playstation exclusive — Horizon Zero Dawn.  

626
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.800
Aloy, while sexually ambiguous, is still to 
this day the subject of many digital artists  

627
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.360
‘fixing’ her appearance. Namely by 
angling her jawline, narrowing her face,  

628
00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.240
removing her freckles, darkening her 
ginger hair, and giving her a smile.

629
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.160
Ladies I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but 
apparently you really need to smile more.

630
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.320
But while we have a slew of female protagonists in  

631
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.320
games where we can try and scrutinize a 
pattern about marketable representation,  

632
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.200
we really don’t have that much data 
on how to sell queer characters.

633
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:21.040
Yes, as I said, we are represented in many smaller 
games and simulators. However, when general fans  

634
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.320
demand more queer representation, they’re a 
little bit put off when you recommend Celeste.  

635
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.200
There’s this attitude that a video game means less 
if it’s made with pixel art or 2-D animations.  

636
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.000
This isn’t necessarily a tried-and-true 
glass ceiling. (See Hades.)

637
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.840
But there is a sense of hierarchy 
among video games. This is indicative  

638
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.280
of Nintendo’s decision to release 
Metroid Dread at full price, whereas  

639
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.120
‘fans’ slammed them because the game wasn’t 
as graphically intensive as say God of War.

640
00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.320
So when fans demand representation, they are 
demanding representation in games like this.  

641
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.040
But reject representation in smaller games, or 
at least ignore it. The assumption here is that  

642
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.360
those games don’t matter as much because they 
aren’t meant to reach the kind of wide-audience  

643
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.880
that Call of Duty is meant to. But a gay 
person in call of duty? That, apparently,  

644
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.120
is a larger indication of queer acceptance.

645
00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.480
Never-mind that Ronald Regan respecting 
your pronouns is about the most ridiculous,  

646
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.760
politically-charged, unnecessary virtue-signalling 
I’ve ever heard of in gaming. Which, in turn,  

647
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.520
leads Gamergate to believe that this is 
what we, queer people, want from gaming  

648
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.560
representation — intrusive, emersion-breaking 
experiences that don’t need to be there.

649
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.680
Hey gamer bros? Queer people 
actually hate that too.  

650
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.200
We dont want Ronald Regan respecting our 
pronouns. We don’t want him anywhere.

651
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.200
But maybe on the other hand, Activision has 
an agenda to woke-wash Regan-era policies.

652
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.920
So representation in Celeste or dating sims 
regardless of their popularity does not register  

653
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.840
as representation because these games are not 
considered to have an audience large enough  

654
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.880
to consider their depictions impactful.

655
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.480
...By us. By queer people. It’s us. We’re 
the ones putting the hierarchy there.  

656
00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.480
We’re the ones who demand queer representation, 
but don’t show up to put money down for the  

657
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:09.280
people who are already giving it to us. We seem 
to have an aversion to supporting smaller studios.  

658
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.320
Or even worse, we dismiss some kinds of video 
games as simply being ‘not real video games.’

659
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.160
Which is a problem through the entire 
gaming industry — but we’re the ones  

660
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.520
asking for something specific in this case.

661
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.120
It’s kinda rude of us to flock to large 
studios at the slightest mention of  

662
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.600
queerness while ignoring smaller developers 
— sometimes even queer-run themselves.  

663
00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.760
And in some cases, queer media will heap on praise 
for even the smallest instance of representation.  

664
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.480
Like when Lego Avengers included Wiccan 
and Hulkling as playable characters.  

665
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.600
Who were not in the story. And you could only 
unlock them at the very very end of the game.  

666
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.800
And they had no effect on the game 
except to get 100% completion.

667
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.080
Why is gay media more interested in celebrating 
a straight-run corporation with a board  

668
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:08.960
of straight directors and predatory straight 
management for making a financially-calculated,  

669
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.880
bare-minimum effort to represent us? Rather 
than, you know, showcasing queer developers  

670
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.920
and smaller studios who produce labours of 
love aimed at depicting our own stories?  

671
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:27.760
Queer news media does have a phenomenally shallow 
scope of what it chooses to cover… In most cases.

672
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.440
By the time queer news broke the 
story on Hades’ queer themes,  

673
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.480
the game had already been a top seller 
on the Nintendo Switch for months.

674
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:44.240
And yet it’s queer media that will lift up 
Bioware for showcasing yet another gay romance  

675
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.680
which you can choose to ignore.

676
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.840
Like I said before, all of this smacks of 
the Disney issue all over again. Where we’re  

677
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:58.880
begging giant corporations to represent us. 
The difference being, there’s actually swaths  

678
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.800
of queer content already existing in the video 
game space. From small independent developers.  

679
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.440
Sometimes those games are leagues better than 
the ones put out by AAA studios. I personally  

680
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:16.320
really like The Last of Us 2, but I put a hell of 
a lot more time into winning over the affection  

681
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.760
of a certain Gridball playing stud in Stardew 
Valley than I did on Ellie’s quest for revenge.

682
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.480
So instead of begging the AAA 
giants to pay attention to us,  

683
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.960
let’s help little games like 
Stardew Valley and Hades  

684
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:38.400
become giant hits. Let’s support the people who 
are already supporting us, not the ones who think  

685
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.160
we need to convince them that we’re worth 
their time. Don’t we already do that enough?
