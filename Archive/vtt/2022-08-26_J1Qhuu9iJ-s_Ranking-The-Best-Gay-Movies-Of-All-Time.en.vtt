00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.720
hello everyone and welcome to my tier
ranking of the uh it was gonna be 50 but

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.519
i added two more so 52 best with big ass
quotes lgbtq movies ever made i created

3
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.240
this list by going through about 16 or
17

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.240
best queer movies ever made lists
finding the movies i've actually seen

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.439
and putting them all together and coming
up with a tier list slay which is

6
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.680
they are like amazing movies must watch
fierce fantastic movies fine

7
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.239
which is kind of
they're good i like them they're not for

8
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.200
everybody flop
i don't like them honestly homophobic

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.640
these aren't necessarily actually
homophobic movies they are more so

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.399
i really don't like the movies people
have asked me for this kind of thing a

11
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.920
lot kind of recommendations for queer
movies so i figured this would be a fun

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.120
way to do it instead of me just you know
putting out a list on twitter actually

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.440
make a movie
make a movie about it i'm going to make

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.320
movies but not right now actually make a
video about it so i can monetize it

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280
because
youtube likes to demonetize everything i

16
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640
make so if it's just me sitting in a
chair i don't

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.799
i don't think they can demonetize this
they'll probably find a way to do

18
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.799
monetize this but i won't let them
because i won't say any dirty words

19
00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.320
because i'm good and
innocent like that but before we

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.119
actually get to the list uh if you just
want to skip ahead to the list skip

21
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.640
ahead to chapter two but anyway i just
drank a lot of coffee little channel

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.400
life update there's a couple of new
videos coming out for september so be

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.920
excited for that or dread them because
one of them is talking about attack on

24
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.560
titan so depending upon your opinion on
that also in september i am moving to

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.079
toronto so there's going to be a little
bit of a gap between when we can make

26
00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.840
the next video so we're going to try and
get some kind of in the can and ready to

27
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.119
go out before the move nick and i are
both moving to toronto very excited

28
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.159
about that we're moving because
as you know from the past we raised a

29
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.479
bunch of money for telos pictures to
make some queer inclusive movies not

30
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.719
queer inclusive queer movies and
where we live now there are no actors

31
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.360
and so we're moving to where there are
actors and we've already got people

32
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.840
applying so that's awesome and if you
like the stuff that i do i would really

33
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.319
appreciate it if you could sign up for
my patreon youtube consistently

34
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.040
demonetizes my videos they've stopped
rating them 18 plus which is nice but

35
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.000
they consistently demonetize the videos
so the only reason that nick and i are

36
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.800
still able to do this is because of
patreon and we've got some really cool

37
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.920
like bonus features patreon exclusive
podcast and all sorts of cool stuff like

38
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.360
that behind the scenes exclusive videos
there's lots over there so we would

39
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480
really appreciate it if you have the
ability to sign up for patreon that

40
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640
would be amazing uh if you don't want to
give your information out to patreon you

41
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.480
can also sign up as a youtube member and
get the same benefits as the patrons if

42
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.000
you can't sign up for patreon or the
youtube membership that's totally fine i

43
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.440
know not everyone is in the position to
be able to do that so you know just

44
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.040
liking and sharing and subscribing to
the channel is a huge huge help that's

45
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.599
the housekeeping done now let's move on
to the tier list the first movie we're

46
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.760
going to talk about is beautiful thing
which is a british movie that came out

47
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.120
in the early 2000s i believe uh about
two boys kind of growing up in not the

48
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.360
best area of england and kind of finding
each other and you know falling in love

49
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.120
and it's cute and stuff it's it's not my
favorite movie because it's very low key

50
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.120
but it's something that it's a gay movie
that isn't stressful it's not incredibly

51
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.440
stressful to watch which is a nice
change of pace so i'm going to rate it

52
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.200
as fine some people are going to hate me
for only putting it in fine but like i

53
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.159
said that's for the movies that are good
but maybe not for everyone maybe

54
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.680
everyone doesn't want the sort of
low-key thing so

55
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.920
that's where that goes more controversy
because the birdcage

56
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.920
is going in sleigh and let me explain my
reasoning for that i know a lot of

57
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.080
people think the birdcage is very
homophobic i disagree

58
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.519
the birdcage is if you haven't seen it
the birdcage is about two older gay men

59
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.439
who have a son together and their son is
marrying this lovely girl whose father

60
00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.400
happens to be an extremely conservative
anti-gay politician drama ensues dragon

61
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.120
sues it's funny it's hilarious nathan
lane is perfection robin williams just

62
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.120
kind of cements his ally status he was
the whole reason the movie got made

63
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.840
it's based on the french movie and play
la caja fall which is also very good but

64
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.600
i do prefer the bird cage partially
because i absolutely adore robin

65
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.560
williams may he rest in peace next up is
bohemian rhapsody i'm torn

66
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560
uh i wanna say it's honestly homophobic
but remy malek's performance is so good

67
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.040
i'm gonna put it in flop remy malik's
performance is really good and of course

68
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.680
you know you can watch it just for the
queen music but the kind of backstory of

69
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.720
the movie being made is very much the
band queen trying to remove as much

70
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.199
gayness from the movie as possible if
you know anything about the queer icon

71
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.280
that is freddie mercury you know that
removing his queerness is kind of hard

72
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.400
but they did their best yeah it just i
i'm not a huge fan of it the director

73
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.600
the original director was brian singer
but he you know disappeared and whatnot

74
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.520
the director who replaced him would go
on to make a much better queer biopic

75
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.680
the following year which we'll talk
about later on on the list it's a flop

76
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.280
remy malik is good though the rest of
the movie not so much next is bound

77
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.360
which is kind of iconic so it's going
into sleigh it's one of the very early

78
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.199
movies from the wachowskis it's
lesbian kinky wonderfulness it's got

79
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.160
gina gershon from showgirls it's got
jennifer tilly from

80
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.240
the chucky universe and it's it's really
good again probably not for everyone

81
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.080
just like the birdcage but as far as i'm
concerned

82
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.840
slay is kind of for the movies that are
iconic these are the iconic queer movies

83
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.759
that everybody should watch and bound is
absolutely iconic and not enough people

84
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.280
know about it everyone just thinks of
the matrix when they think of the witch

85
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.960
house keys and i'm like no the
wachowskis were doing stuff long before

86
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.000
the matrix that you should be paying
attention to for anyone who enjoyed

87
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.120
sense8 i think you will get something
out of bound so definitely worth

88
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.639
checking out next up we have
boy erased which is unfortunately

89
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.400
going into honestly homophobic because
the movie has

90
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.240
good intentions it wants to bring light
to the act of conversion therapy but in

91
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.800
doing so it cast a straight actor as the
kid being sent to conversion therapy

92
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.720
troye sivan is there to try and save it
for its gay cred and he does a fantastic

93
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.680
job by the way i don't know why he
doesn't get more job acting because more

94
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.319
jobs acting cause he's a fantastic actor
but it's just very much

95
00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.560
this movie is being made to educate
straight people by straight people i

96
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.759
don't buy that i don't want that i don't
want movies made for straight people

97
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.759
about gay stuff straight people have
enough movies can we have our gay movies

98
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.919
at least boy erased goes into honestly
homophobic not because it's homophobic

99
00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:20.000
just because i'm kind of like does it
need to exist i don't think it does next

100
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.160
up we have boys don't cry which again
i'm gonna put this into fine

101
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.360
because it is a fantastic movie amazing
performances hilary swank won an oscar

102
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.360
for it for good reason she did a
phenomenal job as brandon tina but god

103
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.440
dang it this movie is sad and depressing
and based on a true story so it's not

104
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.879
like you know it was like bury your
queers or anything like that it's a

105
00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.440
phenomenal movie that's totally worth
watching

106
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.199
if you're in the right headspace but if
you're not in that headspace

107
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:57.039
don't watch it if this movie were made
today

108
00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:03.280
and it was an actress playing a trans
mask character i would bury this movie i

109
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.960
would throw it under a bus okay so next
up we've got back-to-back boys in the

110
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.560
band the first version of the movie came
out in the late 60s i think it was 69 it

111
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.919
might have been 70. 1970. recent one
came out uh on netflix a couple of years

112
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:21.360
ago directed by ryan murphy the
original boys in the band i'm putting up

113
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.879
into fierce because when you look at the
time it was released like i said the

114
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:32.560
very very very early 70s late 60s it was
kind of revolutionary to have a movie

115
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.360
with the entire cast of characters is
queer and it was kind of revolutionary

116
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.560
because it looked at them as people with
you know problems and challenges and

117
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.040
they weren't perfect and again not the
happiest movie in the world directed by

118
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.279
william friedkin who would go on to who
had i believe already

119
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.720
if he hadn't already he was about to
direct the french connection he was

120
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.120
going to go on to direct the exorcist so
william friedkin and i believe he may

121
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.480
pop up somewhere else on this list i
can't remember and so the movie is

122
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.880
incredibly well made based on the play
so like i said kind of revolutionary the

123
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.880
netflix movie made a couple of years
later also really good actually has i

124
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.440
believe it all gay cast or all queer
cast at least but that one's going to go

125
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.200
in fine
because it is a really good movie and

126
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.480
it's totally worth watching and it may
be easier to watch that than the 60s one

127
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.480
just because a lot of people they can't
handle old movies for whatever reason it

128
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.040
is dealing with a lot of gay
self-loathing which i feel like we're

129
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.279
past that now i would hope that we're
past that now but it's a really good

130
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:39.200
movie and it does have an all-gay cast
whereas the original movie didn't

131
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.040
so it's kind of a toss-up between the
two of them of which one kind of gets

132
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.600
more gay points i'm putting the original
in fierce because of how revolutionary

133
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.360
it was at the time
and the remake in fine because it is

134
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.399
still a good movie and it is worth
watching and it does have an all gay

135
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:58.959
cast and a gay director and a gay writer
but the self-loathing can we get over it

136
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:03.600
please next up we have brokeback
mountain which i'm putting in honestly

137
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.240
homophobic hate me if you want but this
movie was is the epitome the epitome

138
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.839
of gay movie made for straight people
straight actors straight directors

139
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.560
straight writers straight people all
around it's

140
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.640
so made by straight people that they
didn't even clue in that having anal sex

141
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.279
after eating beans is not a great idea
and also based on a novella written by a

142
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:29.839
straight woman who has been kind of
problematic in the last couple of years

143
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.680
jake gyllenhaal and heath ledger do a
great job i don't know i just i i've

144
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.600
never got the appeal of the movie like
even when it came out everybody was

145
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.720
talking about it and i mean it was
months before i came to a theater near

146
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.320
me because i was in such a small town
and when it finally did come and i went

147
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.040
and saw it i was expecting to cry
because everyone said this movie so sad

148
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.720
i got to the end and he's there you know
crying into the shirt and everything and

149
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.040
i'm like

150
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.480
i don't get it still i don't i've
watched it since and i don't get the

151
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.399
emotional gut punch that people talk
about and you know a lot of gay people

152
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:05.360
and this is something i completely
understand did kind of put it up on a

153
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.800
pedestal and still hold it up on a
pedestal to this day because it was so

154
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.560
rare to have a gay love story happen in
a hollywood movie even though it was

155
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.959
independently produced a hollywood
studio had nothing to do with it it was

156
00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.600
independent producers come out of the
hollywood machine so i understand why it

157
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.360
is put up on such a pedestal and it
confuses me like the movie made almost

158
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.160
200 million dollars worldwide on a
budget of like five cents you would

159
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.240
think there would have been a whole lot
more gay love stories at least coming

160
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.640
out in the coming years because it was
such a moneymaker and it never did

161
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.120
i wonder why and this movie also it
didn't start the trend but it kind of

162
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.480
cemented the trend of
let's show gay suffering and trauma so

163
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.800
that you know the straight people can be
like oh those poor gays

164
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.240
and we're gonna see a lot more of that
on this list we're gonna we're gonna do

165
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.079
gay suffering so an actor can get
nominated or win an oscar

166
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.440
okay
and we keep doing that next is not a

167
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.320
movie about gay suffering cabaret which
goes into slay because it is

168
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.120
maybe the best musical ever made it
takes place in weimar germany before the

169
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.360
rise of the third reich by the end of
the movie they have kind of risen but

170
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.200
it's before the bad stuff it starts
before the bad stuff really starts to

171
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.360
happen and
you

172
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.279
get to follow a bisexual love triangle
that is actually bisexual the men are

173
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:36.720
sleeping with the men and the women are
sleeping with the men and it's

174
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.760
very refreshing and very interesting and
i love that in the early 70s we got a

175
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.320
movie that won like
a bajillion oscars except best picture

176
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.680
that had at its core
a bisexual love triangle in a musical

177
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.200
and the music is fantastic it's kind of
gone down in history as the musical for

178
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.200
people who hate musicals i don't hate
musicals i love musicals but cabaret is

179
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.000
like the best musical i adore cabaret
and bear in mind the only reason it

180
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.240
didn't get best picture pictures because
it came out the same year as

181
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.000
the godfather so next we have call me by
your name another honestly homophobic

182
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.839
movie though i love the chalamet
sometimes not so much in dune this is

183
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.839
another movie that was
obviously made

184
00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:25.600
for straight people at least it feels
like it was boring it was very boring i

185
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.959
know a lot of gay people love this movie
specifically gay men really love this

186
00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.399
movie and are very willing to overlook
the

187
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.160
let's say questionable age difference i
found it so boring brokeback mountain

188
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.720
was boring too a lot of gay movies that
like everyone loves i find so boring the

189
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.480
stereotype of gay people is that we're
so exciting and flamboyant and you know

190
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.120
we've got the feather boas and the drag
and everything and then the movies that

191
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.560
everyone is like oh my god i love that
gay movie it's so fantastic it's the sad

192
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.639
gays who just cry at the end of the
movie if they're not crying into a

193
00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:01.920
fireplace they're crying into a shirt so
honestly homophobic and the book is also

194
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.920
horrible don't read it next though we
have a really good gay movie but i'm a

195
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720
cheerleader which is going into fierce
because it is a really fun movie

196
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.320
definitely not for everyone anyone who's
kind of gone through any kind of type of

197
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.680
conversion therapy probably not the best
movie for them to check out because it

198
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.399
does it seems like it's making fun of
conversion therapy that it's like a very

199
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:26.639
heightened version of conversion therapy
but from the people i've talked to who

200
00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:30.240
have been through it are like the more
you know about conversion therapy the

201
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.440
more this becomes a horror movie because
it's a lot more real than you would

202
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.800
expect and you know it has a happy
ending which is

203
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.800
rare for gay movies to just kind of have
a happy ending

204
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.120
that's especially in the 90s it was kind
of rare i wish we could go back to the

205
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.320
happy endings in gay movies the next
movie absolutely does not have a happy

206
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.720
ending that is the children's hour which
is fierce because it is a phenomenal

207
00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.880
movie but oh damn is it sad i talked
about it in my history of gay movies

208
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.360
video so for more detail you can go
there basically women as a teacher gets

209
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.600
accused of being a lesbian basically
loses her life and then kills herself so

210
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.639
not for everyone not for everyone but it
is just so good gotta be in the right

211
00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.920
mindset which means i should put it in
fine but i'm putting it in fierce

212
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.760
because it's just so good and the time
of which it came out at the time in this

213
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.760
in the 60s actually worked to humanize
queer people a little bit next we have

214
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.160
cruising starring al pacino which i
talked about in i think monsters in the

215
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:39.600
closet it's a pretty good movie but it
is actually kind of homophobic so i feel

216
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.519
like i gotta put it down there because
it is actually honestly homophobic i

217
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:47.440
don't think they meant it to be
i think they had good intentions but

218
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.360
it's still
[Music]

219
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:56.240
not the best next we have a twofer
first up is dallas buyers club which

220
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.240
is all about a straight guy
with hiv fighting for the ability to get

221
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.199
treatment instead of being a movie about
say act up or gay men's health crisis or

222
00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.880
something like that
uh it's about a straight texan and this

223
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.880
is one where jared leto plays a trans
sex worker and of course won an oscar

224
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.839
for it because queer suffering and of
course the movie about fighting to get

225
00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:25.759
treatment for people with hiv stars
the straightest actor in hollywood i'm

226
00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:29.279
putting this in honestly homophobic
because it honestly kind of is i don't

227
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:33.040
know if there were any gay people who
worked on that movie did you have to

228
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:40.399
cast a cis straight man as a transgender
woman did the main character have to be

229
00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:46.639
a cis straight man dealing with hiv did
it have to be again this is another one

230
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:51.199
of those movies that's obviously made
for straight people which is again like

231
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:54.639
i said a twofer followed up by the
danish girl

232
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:59.600
starring eddie redmayne uh again
honestly homophobic in this case

233
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.400
transphobic because again a man playing
a trans woman isn't great because here's

234
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.640
a clue here here's some information for
people who

235
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.480
don't quite get why that's a problem
when it comes to trans characters you

236
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.400
are telling the audience that this man
is pretending he is acting

237
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.720
as literally acting as a woman in the
story and then people get it in their

238
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.919
heads that trans people are just men
acting as women or women acting as men

239
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.640
that is problematic and that is bad and
that is something that we need to stop

240
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.480
doing and i think eddie redmayne has
actually come out since this movie and

241
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.760
said you know if this was being made
today i wouldn't take the role maybe you

242
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.679
say you wouldn't take the role because
you didn't win an oscar for this one but

243
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:47.919
you know he's still working with joanne
so yeah it goes into honestly homophobic

244
00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:53.120
next is the life and death of marsha p
johnson which goes into slay it's a

245
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.039
fantastic documentary about marsha p
johnson there should be like an actual

246
00:17:57.039 --> 00:18:00.400
hollywood movie about her at this point
but there still isn't it is absolutely

247
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.280
worth watching because the history
is so important to know because there

248
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.600
are so many figures in
what we call the gay rights movement who

249
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.720
were actually trans women and we give
them no credit and it is just huge like

250
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.960
trans erasure by
not giving these women credit for the

251
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.039
things that they did and also again kind
of doing the danish girl thing by saying

252
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:27.440
like oh you know men fought for the gay
rights and then you see marsha b johnson

253
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.919
and you think oh maybe that's a drag
queen no marsha p johnson was a woman

254
00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:35.200
that's why i think everyone needs to
watch this documentary which is followed

255
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.840
up oddly by disclosure another sleigh
which is a documentary that's on netflix

256
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.600
which is about trans representation in
media over

257
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.320
about the last century which is first of
all an incredibly well made documentary

258
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.720
but also points out all the problems
with with having

259
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.039
cis actors playing trans characters and
how that can really kind of give the

260
00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:01.360
audience the impression that being trans
is just acting it gives so much

261
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.559
information and such a quick
just

262
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:08.559
in such a quick time absolutely worth
the watch check it out

263
00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:13.120
it's on netflix everybody has netflix go
watch it next we have a movie that is

264
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.600
little known among the youthful gays
edge of 17 which is a movie that came

265
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.440
out in the 90s but it takes place in the
80s about two boys who fall in love in

266
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.679
the 80s lots of awesome the soundtrack
is phenomenal i saw this movie on cable

267
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:28.960
when i was really young it was on at
like two in the morning i think i was

268
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.559
like 10. i just immediately fell in love
with it i can't it's been a while since

269
00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:37.120
i watched it but it was really good and
i had such a crush on the blonde guy

270
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.240
he's got bleach blonde hair i had such a
crush on him totally worth the watch but

271
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.000
i'm gonna put it in fine because it is
very much of the time

272
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.480
and so maybe not for everybody
but absolutely worth watching especially

273
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.280
if you're around my age and it's a movie
that you probably should have seen at

274
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.919
that time frame you know it's kind of
the

275
00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:00.320
gay never been kissed kind of thing
every 12 year old girl saw never been

276
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.799
kissed but every 12 year old boy did not
see edge of 17. so definitely worth

277
00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:10.320
watching it now to pick up on it next we
have everything everywhere

278
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.760
all at once which i'm not going to talk
too much about it goes into slay but i'm

279
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.240
not going to talk too much better
because there is a video coming out

280
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.039
dealing with everything everywhere all
at once i'm just going to say watch it

281
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:24.720
all right so
next we have a movie that

282
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.000
i'm willing to bet a lot of you actually
haven't heard of it's called heavenly

283
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.520
creatures
and it was directed by peter jackson

284
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.039
before lord of the rings it was actually
the movie that convinced new line cinema

285
00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:42.559
to allow him to make lord of the rings
it got pj an oscar nomination for best

286
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:45.679
original screenplay i think it might
have been adapted screenplay but best

287
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:50.640
best screenplay it's just this very sad
but beautiful story of

288
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.799
two teenage girls
kind of falling in love and it's this in

289
00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:58.720
new zealand in the 1950s i think it
might be the early 60s but it's that

290
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.679
time period the sort of surrealist world
they have to create where they can go

291
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:08.400
and be themselves because
in the real world everyone is pushing

292
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.760
against them it's an incredibly
beautiful movie it's kate winslet before

293
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.760
titanic it's peter jackson before lord
of the rings it's

294
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.440
absolutely worth watching it is
it's a beautiful movie so heavenly

295
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.520
creatures goes into fierce
next is

296
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.159
hedvig and the angry inch which i'm
putting into slay immediately because it

297
00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:34.960
is phenomenal i know a lot of people
find it

298
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.440
a bit problematic because the main
character hedvig is a born a boy and

299
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.760
growing up in east berlin and meets an
american military

300
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.159
general i think
and falls in love but in order to get

301
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:54.480
married and get out of east berlin has
to have gender reassignment surgery

302
00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.320
which doesn't go over well the angry
inch and so it's kind of this weird

303
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.280
middle ground of choosing to be trans
but not really wanting to be but then

304
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.520
accepting the role of the woman and so
it's

305
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.280
a lot of people find it problematic but
the way i kind of look at it now as the

306
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.440
creator of hedvig john cameron mitchell
has come out as non-binary i kind of see

307
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.679
it as more
of

308
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:26.159
them exploring
that sort of non-binary identity that in

309
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:31.120
between between man and woman it's just
fantastic and the music is amazing and

310
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.120
john cameron mitchell was fantastic in
it they got nominated for a golden globe

311
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.640
but not an oscar which i feel is just a
slap in the face that should have been

312
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.240
nominated for an oscar for the next
movie we have another documentary and

313
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.840
i'm putting it in fierce it's called how
to survive a plague

314
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.480
which is the story of act up which is
basically the reason that treatments for

315
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.880
aids and hiv
actually became available to people they

316
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.880
were a nice way of saying it is that
they were a protest movement

317
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760
um
straight people at the time would maybe

318
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.640
even go so far as to call them
terrorists

319
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.520
but they were not they were a protest
movement fighting to make aids treatment

320
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.360
available
and they're the only reason that hiv and

321
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.320
aids today
is considered a very livable disease

322
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.440
it's something that if you're diagnosed
with it's not a death sentence anymore

323
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.280
you take a pill every day and you're
probably good and it's because of these

324
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.200
people that we got there and the fact
that thousands of them had to die

325
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.880
literally fighting for their lives
before we could get there

326
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.080
because the government especially in the
united states was so just

327
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.919
the government just didn't give a damn
and i feel like their story really ought

328
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:49.600
to be told because there are a lot of
people who don't know the story of act

329
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.200
up and don't know the story of the gay
men's health crisis and don't know the

330
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.200
story of hiv and aids and they just know
that it used to kill you and now it

331
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.440
doesn't and it's like yeah but the story
of how we got there is so important and

332
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.919
necessary i feel like a lot of people my
age and younger don't appreciate it so

333
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:10.480
much because we came of aids after
protease inhibitors kind of kicked in

334
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.600
really necessary viewing
for people who don't know the full

335
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.159
context of what was going on in the 80s
and early 90s next we have the imitation

336
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:24.080
game which i'm putting into honestly
homophobic because

337
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:31.039
we have a person a real life person in
alan turing who was gay and the movie

338
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:34.159
basically ignores it until the last five
minutes and they're like oh and he was

339
00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:36.480
chemically castrated by the government
has had

340
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.679
they focused on his achievements which
were

341
00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:43.840
amazing achievements in scientific
fields and basically won world war ii

342
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.159
for the allies but the movie doesn't
really deal with the fact that he won

343
00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:52.240
world war ii
for the allies for england and then

344
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.400
england punished him by chemically
castrating him and putting him in a

345
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.640
state where he killed himself it very
much glosses over it in the end i would

346
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.320
have put it into flop because of that
but the writer of the screenplay very

347
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.200
vehemently
said

348
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.360
i this is not a gay movie girl you wrote
a movie

349
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.840
about a gay man
and you are saying it's not a gay movie

350
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.720
i am sorry you have mistaken your
screenplay for something that it is not

351
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.799
and so because of that it goes into
honestly homophobic next we have in and

352
00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:32.799
out which is a comedy from the mid 90s
which is about a man who thinks he's

353
00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:35.760
straight for most of his life and then
realizes he's gay just as he's about to

354
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.720
get married and it's kind of about his
coming out process and he's

355
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:48.080
uh late 30s early 40s ish so you know
he's oh god older oh i feel old now and

356
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.279
it did really well in the 90s and was
really well liked in the 90s it is very

357
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:58.960
of its time though it is very
much a 90s movie so i'm gonna put it in

358
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.679
fine
because it's not the best movie ever

359
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:06.640
made by any means it's not the best gay
movie ever made it's not

360
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.400
great
but it's worth a watch like if you're

361
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.919
bored and you've watched all the other
movies on the list that i'm recommending

362
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:18.320
it's worth putting it on to just kind of
see where the mindset of

363
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.600
hollywood was when it came to gay people
in the mid 90s next we have the movie

364
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.080
kill your darlings which i used a bunch
of footage from

365
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.679
in
the

366
00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:33.200
recent uh queer panic video in that
section of the queer panic video it is

367
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.880
the story of that that's what the
movie's about it's not a great movie it

368
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.600
puts a lot more
humanity i think into the character

369
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.200
slash real person of lucian carr than he
had in real life who may or may not be

370
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.559
the progenitor of the demon twink but it
is a well-made movie and the

371
00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:54.320
performances are really good and there's
you know a gay sex scene between deng de

372
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.600
haan and daniel radcliffe so i can't say
it's a flop so i'm going to put it in

373
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.039
fine but maybe seek out a documentary
about the murder if you actually want to

374
00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:04.559
know what happened and the whole
conflict and everything because it's a

375
00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:07.760
bit more complicated than the movie
portrays which is a running theme

376
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.640
apparently because the next movie is
king cobra which is a highly

377
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.840
fictionalized version of the murder of
brian coaches i talk about this in my

378
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.840
documentary making it big it's the story
of kind of the drama between brian

379
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.159
coaches and brent corrigan sean lockhart
the movie has some

380
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:29.840
really solid performances in there
especially from garrett clayton and

381
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.640
christian slater they do a fantastic job
in it gary clayton is a lot more

382
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.520
built
than brent was at the time considering

383
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.200
brent was legitimately underage during
his time working with brian it's

384
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.840
probably better to have him look a
little older but the problem with the

385
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.600
movie is that it does not tell the truth
it erases real people it kind of

386
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.399
moves blame onto
different people that weren't to blame

387
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:58.480
it doesn't make brian look
completely innocent

388
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.880
but it kind of goes out of its way to
say isn't it sad that he's dead and it's

389
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.559
like well it's sad when anyone is
murdered but brian coaches was kind of

390
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:11.360
an absolutely trash person the movie
really goes out of its way to

391
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.720
make it seem like he wasn't i think they
were trying to do that in the screenplay

392
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.840
phase to get the family to allow them to
use his name which they did not anyway

393
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.279
that goes into flop because i know the
story of brent corrigan slash sean

394
00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:32.880
lockhart very well intimately and i know
that there is a much better movie to be

395
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.159
made of it than was made in king cobra
so next we have the looking movie which

396
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:44.240
was produced by hbo as a sort of
consolation for not giving it a final

397
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.679
season it's fine
i think the movie is actually better

398
00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:52.880
than the show i watched most of the show
and i just could not get into it i tried

399
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.080
it like i was expecting it to try and be
a new queers folk and it was so boring

400
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.919
the fact that i got through as much of
the show as i did is entirely because of

401
00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:05.919
jonathan groff but the movie is better
than the show and so i'm putting it in

402
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:09.760
fine it's worth watching if you did
watch the show if you haven't watched

403
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.640
the show don't bother because it means
you have to watch the show to know

404
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.679
what's going on in the movie and then i
just i don't recommend watching the show

405
00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:20.880
next up we have the very controversial
love simon based on the book by becky

406
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.159
albertalli
simon in the homo sapien agenda which i

407
00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.880
really liked the book and at the time i
really liked the movie i do think the

408
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.039
movie's really cute but it is very much
a movie i i think the filmmaker the film

409
00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:36.559
the director
um i'm pretty sure he was like meant to

410
00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:42.399
make a movie for gay teenagers but what
it turned into was a movie

411
00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:47.600
for teenage girls and their moms
to kind of go ah aren't the gays cute

412
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.919
and that's what it became on social
media so it's it's not a bad movie i'm

413
00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:58.159
also annoyed that the the lead actor is
ostensibly straight i don't think he's

414
00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:00.559
come out one way or the other i think
he's kind of

415
00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:04.799
remained vague about it you're making a
movie with a gay lead character find a

416
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:09.039
gay actor please they made such a big
deal of this movie being so gay and it's

417
00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:14.320
like you couldn't find a gay actor
in all of hollywood really but i'm gonna

418
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.000
put it in fine
because it's not a bad movie but if

419
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.760
you're kind of older and cynical as i
have become since the movie came out

420
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.279
you're probably not going to enjoy it
okie dokie so next we have mambo

421
00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:32.000
italiano which was a canadian movie made
in the early 2000s and kind of aped the

422
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.640
um my big fat greek wedding thing except
it was italian even though they actually

423
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.480
shared a lot of the same actors for the
supporting cast because

424
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.600
they were like well greeks and italians
they look alike it's mediterranean

425
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.960
what's the difference and it's a cute
movie like it i wouldn't say it's like

426
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.480
peak cinema or anything but it's worth
watching

427
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.640
it's not offensive is it as good as my
big fat greek wedding

428
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.799
no but neither was the sequel to my big
factory wedding i'm gonna put it in fine

429
00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:01.360
fine is the middle of the road that
seems to be where most of the movies are

430
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.039
ending up so that makes sense so yeah
worth watching if you're looking for

431
00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:08.640
something very light-hearted that you
can just put on and kind of enjoy and

432
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.320
not have to think about too much
and if you want to be exposed to

433
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.480
canadian cinema before i do that to you
before i expose you to canadian cinema

434
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.559
sounds so ominous anyway next we have a
movie from the czech republic called

435
00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:29.919
mandragora which i accidentally watched
when i was a teenager it's it's a long

436
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:37.519
movie it's like three hours long maybe
even longer about a teenage sex worker

437
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:44.559
in prague i believe it's like it's dark
as far as like tone it's not dissimilar

438
00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:49.120
from requiem for a dream so if you've
seen requiem for a dream and you're like

439
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.799
i can deal with that for three and a
half hours and reading subtitles

440
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:56.080
absolutely worth watching because it's
actually a phenomenal movie and nobody

441
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.360
like hears about this movie i added this
to the list because it's really good

442
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.159
it's not on any of the lists because
they all ignore movies that aren't in

443
00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:05.919
english but i added this to the list
because it is really good so i'm putting

444
00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:09.519
it in fierce
because it is a really really good movie

445
00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:13.440
next we have maurice which is the movie
that made every gay man in the world

446
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.279
fall in love with hugh grant and it's
really good it's a very it's a very

447
00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:23.279
certain type of movie it is um if you've
seen any other merchant if you know what

448
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:26.559
a merchant ivory film is you know what
the kind of movie i'm talking about it's

449
00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:30.559
very slow it's not the most exciting
movie in the world but it is really well

450
00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:36.240
made and hugh grant does a fantastic job
in it as a period piece watching a gay

451
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.399
story take place pre-1960s
it's almost a novelty while watching the

452
00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:45.919
movie
and so i'm gonna put it in fierce the

453
00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:49.279
next movie is
mayor pete

454
00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:52.880
a documentary about pete

455
00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:01.279
butterjudge the next movie is milk the
2008 film starring sean penn as harvey

456
00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:05.679
milk directed by gus van sant i
loved this movie i haven't watched it

457
00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:09.600
since 2010
i think somewhere around there it came

458
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.279
out while i was in film school and i saw
it five times in theaters and i cried

459
00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:17.120
every time the ending of the movie with
the candles going down the street i just

460
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.679
bawled every time total
crying mess i took i went so many times

461
00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:24.960
because i just kept taking different
people i was in school with to the movie

462
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.720
and so i'm putting this in sleigh
because it is an amazing movie

463
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.200
it should have won best picture that
year in my humble opinion it's a movie

464
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.159
that really makes you wonder okay if
harvey milk

465
00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:41.760
had not been murdered how much further
along would gay rights have been not

466
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.159
just today but like say in the 80s in
the 90s at least in like even even just

467
00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:50.559
limiting it to california how much
further would gay rights have been in

468
00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:56.480
california would it have been 2004
before the mayor of san francisco said

469
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.240
i'm going to start performing
same-sex marriages would that have maybe

470
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.640
happened in the 80s or the 90s had
harvey milk been around to kind of be

471
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.399
the mouthpiece for the movement that we
really needed and

472
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:12.560
never got
again really there was never a sort of

473
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.520
martin luther king figure for the lgbt
rights movement and harvey milk was kind

474
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.919
of being set up to be that figure but
died before he could really get a

475
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:25.440
national
stage he may have been the first gay

476
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.639
person to be elected to congress at
least the first out gay person and of

477
00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.440
course you have to take into context
that would he have lived through the

478
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.599
aids crisis and all of that but even
then you know it's just it's interesting

479
00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:39.839
to think about how much further along we
might have been had dan white not

480
00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:44.800
apparently eaten too many twinkies and
went and killed harvey milk and mayor

481
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.000
moscone that day in san francisco and
next we have monster which is going

482
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.720
directly into the fierce category it's
not going into slay because it is

483
00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:01.280
dark but it is charlize thrawn at her
best everyone says she won the oscar

484
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.599
because she got ugly for the role i i do
not believe that for one minute she

485
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:09.599
deserved that oscar because of the
performance she gave it was phenomenal

486
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:13.359
it was her being amazing it was patty
jenkins being amazing before she had too

487
00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:16.560
much control and ruined the second
wonder woman movie it was really really

488
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.240
good and we don't have enough movies
about lesbian serial killers so if you

489
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.839
are in a dark mood put on monster it's
it's a really phenomenal movie it's kind

490
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:30.240
of been forgotten over the last 20 years
it's like oh that movie that charlize

491
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.520
thrawn won her oscar for yeah but it's
actually a really good movie and i'd

492
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.320
also like to point out which nick just
reminded me of

493
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.680
charlize thrawn has a trans child who is
she is very protective of

494
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.359
and she's a huge ally so support
charlize thrawn

495
00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:50.880
always next we have moonlight the movie
that lost best picture to lala land i

496
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.960
mean no it won best picture right faye
dunaway doesn't think so

497
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.560
she she's still angry about the gays and
mommy dearest

498
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.480
it go it goes into slay it's a lot of
people were like oh it's going to be the

499
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.280
black brokeback mountain it's like
that's not how movies work you know it

500
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.920
follows this person this gay person
through their life it's not about their

501
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.960
relationship with someone it is about
them

502
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.560
being
a person and they're gay but they are

503
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.960
first and foremost a person
who is growing up in this kind of

504
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.480
environment that
you know the overall environment is

505
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.480
toxic toward gay people hyper masculine
thug crime environment but in the end of

506
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.599
the movie he finds someone who allows
him to kind of exit that a little bit

507
00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:42.880
and we don't know if you know he leaves
the life of crime or anything like that

508
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.960
but
for a moment

509
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.800
he is allowed to leave that and be
just

510
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.599
a person instead of a gangster you know
he lets he's allowed to let the facade

511
00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:58.800
drop and watching the progression of
this character go from this

512
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.000
innocent child to this teenager trying
to make it through with an incredibly

513
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.599
abusive mother
to this man who has put up every

514
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:12.079
possible wall to protect himself from
the world and the people in it

515
00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:17.520
to get to the end of the movie and see
him let some of those walls drop for one

516
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.160
person
it's incredibly touching and i am so sad

517
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.720
that it's really for so many people just
remembered as the movie that won best

518
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.599
picture instead of la la land instead of
it being you know one of the best movies

519
00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:35.760
made in the last 20 years so next we
have

520
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.359
mulholland drive david lynch's
lesbian fever dream if you've never seen

521
00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:46.160
a david lynch movie this is probably a
safe place to start no no

522
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.359
i i don't know what i would recommend
being the first david lynch movie to

523
00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:54.400
watch but mulholland drive is i think
along with blue velvet tied for his best

524
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.920
movie naomi watch deserved best actress
for this movie if you have seen it you

525
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.800
know what i'm talking about because she
runs the gamut from like

526
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.720
innocent girl moving from the midwest to
california to be an actress to

527
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.079
rung out actress who has been put
through it by the system and the

528
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:12.960
hollywood system and is just
you know

529
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.119
left a junkie in the end oh my god it's
such a good movie i i'm still angry that

530
00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:20.480
david lynch didn't win best director for
this movie because there is there are

531
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.839
moments of this movie that
reach a level in filmmaking

532
00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:31.520
that other movies could only hope to
reach there is a moment that is

533
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.599
considered the most terrifying moment in
film history and this isn't a horror

534
00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:39.839
movie this and it's not a gory thing
it's just

535
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:46.480
the existence of a type of person and
it's considered more horrifying than

536
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.920
like anything else ever made and that
has nothing to do with the whole the

537
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.240
main storyline which is about amnesia
and all sorts of stuff it's

538
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.960
watch it but watch it when you have
absolutely nothing else to do and all of

539
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.839
your like phone and your phone and
computer and everything is off because

540
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:05.520
you need to pay attention to this movie
and then watch it again

541
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.400
and suddenly everything will click it's
one of those movies you gotta watch

542
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.839
twice so
yeah mulholland drive goes up to sleigh

543
00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:15.839
because it's one of my favorite movies
flop is missing so many movies i know

544
00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:19.839
i'm seeing so much nicer this time i
filmed this video once before and i was

545
00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:24.000
much meaner the last time alright so the
next movie is

546
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.079
my own private idaho uh it's going up
into fierce oh maybe fine see it's

547
00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.599
better than the movies in fine but it's
a movie that's kind of like

548
00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:37.119
you need to be in the right mood to
watch my own private idaho yeah but man

549
00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:41.359
dragora also is that kind of mood and
the children's hour so i'm not really

550
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:45.119
following that rule yeah i'm not
following the fine rule at all i'm

551
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:49.760
following my heart's rule the movie
stars keanu reeves in probably his best

552
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.359
performance of his entire career
and river phoenix also giving his best

553
00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:59.359
performance of his entire career and
watching it now it's so

554
00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:04.720
like the movie is sad in itself but
seeing what river phoenix was capable of

555
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.200
and then knowing that he died not long
after the movie was made

556
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.520
is like wow we've lost a huge talent so
it's it's it's like it's a sad movie

557
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.839
anyway but it's even sadder with the
real life context so next we have the

558
00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:24.400
normal heart
which is a relatively recent movie from

559
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.240
i think it was hbo based on the play of
the same name by larry kramer which is a

560
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.440
fictionalized account of the creation of
act up in the gay men's health crisis so

561
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.040
it's kind of following the same
story-ish of how to survive a plague but

562
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.280
with kind of different people it's
fictionalized because larry kramer had a

563
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.040
habit of writing things about his
friends and his friends being very angry

564
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.160
at him about it so he fictionalized it
and they still knew who they were anyway

565
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.520
the the cast is kind of split between
straight actors and gay actors it's

566
00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.400
directed by ryan murphy and ryan murphy
i think is a much better film director

567
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.680
than
sort of show runner for tv his tv shows

568
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.280
are like great for half a season and
then fall off but his movies don't have

569
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.160
time to fall off so they just kind of
sustain their goodness so the normal

570
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.160
heart is going into
fierce not just because it's a good

571
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.720
movie but because people need to know
more about that

572
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.839
time period
and they need to know about the people

573
00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:28.079
who were actually fighting instead of
saying that nancy reagan was a champion

574
00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:30.960
of human rights if you know who i'm
talking about you know who i'm talking

575
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.200
about so next we have paris is burning a
documentary about the ballroom scene in

576
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.960
new york city in the 1980s which a
couple of years ago i would have put

577
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.040
into slay but have recently found out
that there's some behind-the-scenes

578
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.960
stuff that sucks being that the
filmmakers have been very cagey with the

579
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.839
people they made the documentary about
like

580
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:55.599
were kind of perfectly fine with them
living in poverty and didn't try and do

581
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:58.319
anything to help them or anything like
that and they were just like let's make

582
00:41:58.319 --> 00:42:03.920
a movie about these people so although
it is iconic for any drag queen and for

583
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.480
any queer person who has watched it
anyone who's been involved in the

584
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.839
ballroom scene at all if you have
watched a single season of drag race you

585
00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:14.000
have heard a thousand quotes from this
movie but i gotta put it in flop just

586
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.520
because of how the producers ended up
treating the people they were making

587
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.760
this documentary about
so next we have philadelphia which stars

588
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.920
tom hanks
and

589
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.680
antonio banderas and denzel washington
it was directed by jonathan demi right

590
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.560
after silence of the lambs and it was
his way of apologizing to the gay

591
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.720
community for silence of the lambs
because lots of gay people were angry at

592
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.079
him and lots of trans people were angry
at him for silence of the lambs and so

593
00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:45.200
he felt like he needed to apologize by
making a movie

594
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.720
humanizing
people in the gay community especially

595
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.079
aids victims which was very good at the
time because it did kind of you know

596
00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:55.760
with tom hanks who had the one-two punch
of getting best actor for philadelphia

597
00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.560
and forrest gump one after the other and
it's a very well made movie but

598
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.800
my problem with it is that it is
very much oh look how the gays do suffer

599
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.400
and so even though it's incredibly well
made i gotta put it in flop because i am

600
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:19.839
really just over the
oh look how the gays suffer movies yeah

601
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:27.599
so sorry next we have the iconic the
impenetrable pink flamingos which i want

602
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:31.680
to put into slay because i absolutely
love it but i'm not going to because i'm

603
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.760
going to put into fierce
because you need to be in the right

604
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.680
mindset to watch pink flamingos you need
to be in the right mindset to watch most

605
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:45.040
of john waters movies barring like hair
spray and cereal mom but pink flamingos

606
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:52.400
in particular because there are some
scenes people might consider

607
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.760
to be in bad taste
maybe if you have recently watched

608
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.560
cello 120 days of sodom
then this would be a good palette

609
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.160
cleanser for you
okay we just had to do a little cut

610
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.880
because the hard drive wanted to crap
out right where we're getting to the end

611
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.800
of it so next up priscilla queen of the
desert which i'm gonna put into

612
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.640
fierce because how can i not put it into
fears again talked about this in the

613
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.640
camp video which is like two hours long
but you should totally go watch it cause

614
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:29.920
like nobody did priscilla is hilarious i
find that a lot of americans don't find

615
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.000
it funny and i wonder if it's like a uh
there's a disconnect between american

616
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.520
comedy and comedy from all the
commonwealth nathan

617
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.319
nathan's
nations like the uk and ireland and and

618
00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:46.560
canada and australia and new zealand
america's comedy is kind of different

619
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.640
you've got a great performance from hugo
weaving before the matrix and lord of

620
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.800
the rings you got a great performance
from guy pierce before like memento and

621
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.280
stuff like that and guy pierce is just
like totally sexy the entire time he's

622
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.680
on screen and a great performance from
terence stamp who is playing

623
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.960
again
a man playing a trans woman but

624
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.800
considering the time when which this
movie was made that was kind of

625
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.640
brave i hate saying that that it was
brave but you know it could have been

626
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.480
like a career killer at the time but he
just did it so well

627
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.599
and but you know if this movie was made
today i would be like demanding that

628
00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:24.960
that character be played by a trans
person considering it's like almost 30

629
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:32.480
years old i kind of have to look at it
with that framing of how many movies

630
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.760
had trans
characters

631
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.720
who were wholly sympathetic
at that time and this one does have a

632
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.839
wholly sympathetic trans character and
so i'm like

633
00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:48.720
okay me a cis person will forgive you
for that but if you're trans i totally

634
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.960
get it if you'd like to hate the movie i
totally get it next up we have rocket

635
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.359
man which is the better version of
bohemian rhapsody same director much

636
00:45:57.359 --> 00:46:02.400
better so much gayer actually has gay
sex in there between taran edgerton and

637
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.000
richard madden which is like put me in
between those two please and it doesn't

638
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.480
shy away from the gay it doesn't shy
away from the queerness it doesn't it's

639
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.880
not like
it's very gay and very truthful that was

640
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.839
one of the nice things is that elton
john was like there's no point in making

641
00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:20.319
a movie about me
if

642
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:24.160
we try and sanitize it and so they
didn't he is a drug addict and he does

643
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.599
have problems and stuff like that the
ending of the movie is him kind of

644
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:31.520
overcoming a lot of that stuff and so
it's fantastic it's so so good and then

645
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.400
taryn edgerton ended up like becoming
really good friends with elton john and

646
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.319
narrated his audiobook and everything
it's it's just a fantastic movie really

647
00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:42.880
really good so i'm gonna put it
in

648
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.040
fierce
next we have the rocky horror picture

649
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.720
show which is so many people's first
queer movie i think i've got to put it

650
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:56.400
in fierce again because
it is it's so good i mean it's bad but

651
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.920
it's so good
it you know introduced the world to tim

652
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.839
curry so that alone is worth putting it
in fears it inspired generations upon

653
00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:10.480
generations of baby drag queens i know
that some of the lyrics

654
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.280
are problematic sweet transvestite from
transsexual transylvania but it's it is

655
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.640
pure camp and the thing is the movie is
very aware that it's problematic you

656
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.160
know not trying to say that any of these
people are great people because even it

657
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.960
like acknowledges that brad and janet
are boring and not entirely against the

658
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.000
idea of cheating on each other with the
right sweet transvestite or

659
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
kind of newly born sexy man so yeah i
love rocky horror um

660
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.720
i'm kind of tempted to move it up to
sleigh to be honest

661
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.280
yeah it has to it's iconic it's an
iconic queer movie it has to next we

662
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.800
have stonewall directed by roland
emmerich best known for anonymous

663
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.440
and also independence day and that
god-awful godzilla movie he is gay and

664
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.599
he wanted to make a movie that would
kind of tell the historical story of

665
00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:10.880
stonewall from the point of view of a
midwestern

666
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.599
blonde white boy who happened to be
there and started the gay revolution

667
00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:20.000
um instead of the people who were
actually there fighting the cops who

668
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.240
were
trans women and lesbians and uh people

669
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.880
of color whereas all the white men
were you know screening away so that

670
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.280
they could go back to their office jobs
the next day it's honestly homophobic

671
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.359
epitomizes
all of the negative stuff i've been

672
00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:41.440
talking about in this video everything
that's in flop and honestly homophobic

673
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.359
is kind of right there in stonewall and
it's so weird that because stonewall

674
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:51.040
wanted to be the gay movie it wanted to
be you know the gay oscar movie and it

675
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:57.920
was just bad like not just the content
like badly it was badly made it was it

676
00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.000
erased so many trans characters it
erased characters of color maybe with

677
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.319
the best intentions but roland
know your limitations don't try and win

678
00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:13.359
an oscar speaking of oscars the favorite
which is going immediately into slay

679
00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:17.599
because the favorite is one of the best
movies made in the last like 20 years it

680
00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:23.599
is fantastic olivia coleman is just
iconic

681
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:27.599
in this movie i started watching it
knowing that everyone was kind of like

682
00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:31.440
over the moon about it i didn't know
there were lesbians in it and i started

683
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.559
watching it i was like oh is this
are they

684
00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:40.160
is it oh oh oh i adore olivia coleman
now i've always loved emma stone and

685
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.359
rachel vice and then olivia coleman
comes on the screen and it's just like

686
00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:49.359
oh
this is magical the cinematography is

687
00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:54.079
beautiful
and the costumes and everything and you

688
00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:57.599
know i'll watch anything with nicholas
holt in it and him just being a dumbass

689
00:49:57.599 --> 00:50:01.119
during the entire movie is great and
duck racing

690
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:05.839
have you ever seen ducks race
if it's in the movie you should see it

691
00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:10.640
uh the kids are all right i'm gonna the
kids are all right is basically

692
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.640
um two lesbian moms are dealing with
kind of their kids

693
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.160
meeting their
biological father

694
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.440
and you know it's it's
it's fine

695
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.960
it's fine it's not like revolutionary or
anything the performances are good the

696
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.280
directing is good the script is good but
it's not like oh you have to rush out

697
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.640
and watch this right now unlike the next
movie the old guard which is absolutely

698
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.599
going into fierce because i would put it
in sleigh but the main characters aren't

699
00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:47.599
queer but just watching the movie and
then suddenly there's two guys in the

700
00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:51.839
background cuddling and then you have
this profession of love from one of them

701
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:54.720
and it's just like
from one of them to the other and it's

702
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.800
like oh my god i love this where has
this been in every action movie ever why

703
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.520
is this just happening now and the
action in it is unbelievable amazing

704
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.960
action again charlize thrawn because she
is ally supreme and i just i i loved it

705
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:14.319
it was fantastic i talked about it in
the yuri on ice video oddly and it's

706
00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:18.319
just such a good movie the hilarious
thing was

707
00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:23.280
nobody was talking about joe and nicki
being gay because although it is it's

708
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.559
obvious you know they have that scene
where they you know profess their love

709
00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:30.240
to each other everything else in the
movie was so good and it's kind of this

710
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.040
you know gay people were talking about
joe and nicky but straight people were

711
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.280
like this movie's badass and it's like
hollywood see when you make a really

712
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.480
good movie and there are gay characters
in it and you don't make a big deal

713
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.760
about their being gay characters in it
they just exist like we do in real life

714
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.960
people don't make a big deal about their
being gay characters in it because the

715
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.839
people watch the movie and they're like
this is awesome and then you have

716
00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:52.880
everyone saying this is an awesome movie
and then the bigots are too afraid to

717
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.319
get ripped apart on twitter so they
don't say anything bad about it

718
00:51:56.319 --> 00:52:00.559
so
to certain studios who keep trying to

719
00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:04.559
make their being gay characters in a
movie the biggest pressed tour event in

720
00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:09.280
the world stop doing that next we have
some more much needed sapphic

721
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.960
representation with carol
which is not a happy movie by any means

722
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.920
but
really good and one of those movies

723
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.440
that's just like some of the best
performances i've ever seen from rooney

724
00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.800
mara and
cate blanchett and it's so rare to see a

725
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.760
movie about queer people taking place in
that time frame in that you know that

726
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.880
late 50s early 60s kind of hoop skirt
housewife kind of era and to kind of

727
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.319
show just
what it was like

728
00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:42.640
to be not just gay but to be a gay woman
at that time because you were a part of

729
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.720
two minorities that were basically
considered

730
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.800
powerless and worthless like women were
only good for making babies so if you

731
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.000
were a lesbian
well your one utility in the world was

732
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.599
gone so what's the use of you at all and
that's kind of the outlook that people

733
00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:03.200
had at the time so being a lesbian was
really worse than being a gay man

734
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.160
because if you were a gay man at least
you could still you know

735
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.079
i don't know lift a
hammer and build something or something

736
00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:14.480
like that but for lesbians it was like
you have no use to us you know the movie

737
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.599
does not shy away from saying that and
one of cate blanchett's best

738
00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:20.000
performances
rent

739
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.400
2005.
when rent first came out it was like my

740
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.119
favorite movie ever because it came out
at a time i had just gotten my first

741
00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:34.319
digital video camera and i was just
starting to make movies uh like movies

742
00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:37.200
that i was actually editing and stuff i
started making movies when i was in the

743
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.119
sixth grade but i was in the 11th grade
at this time

744
00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:45.599
and i had just gotten my first digital
video camera and i was making movies and

745
00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:50.000
editing and experimenting and doing
stuff like that and the whole idea of no

746
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.480
but no day but today and be creative and
all of that just really

747
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.720
was very important to me and then i
watched it again

748
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.319
i didn't watch it for probably a decade
and i just had really fond memories of

749
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:06.400
it because
it came up came to me at a time in my

750
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.920
life that i have very fond memories of
because i'm a gay who has fond memories

751
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.720
of high school because i'm weird like
that because i watched lindsey ellis's

752
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.319
video tearing rent apart and i was like
no rent is amazing what are you talking

753
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.640
about you crazy woman what are you
talking about

754
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:25.040
and then i rewatched it and i was like
maybe i'm the crazy one when i watched

755
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.200
the movie originally i really identified
with mark and when i watched it the 10

756
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.480
years later i wanted to beat him with
that camera everything in it just i mean

757
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.440
just go watch lindsay's video on it and
i am eventually going to make a video

758
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.960
talking about rent because it is
necessary some of the musical numbers

759
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.400
are like supreme like awesome like
fantastic i love them i will put on take

760
00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.559
me or leave me and i will belt for four
minutes straight but i've gotta put it

761
00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:56.640
in flop because it is so much gen x
angst and as a millennial i can't i

762
00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:03.040
cannot accept that anymore mark is
offered like a sixty thousand dollar a

763
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:08.799
year part-time job
filming videos and he quits

764
00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:14.640
and this takes place in the late 80s
flop it's a flop but it was also a flop

765
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.280
at the box office so last but certainly
not least

766
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.480
angels in america talking about the
movie but also the play because there is

767
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.839
a pro-shot version of the play that you
can check out and it's totally worth it

768
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:30.960
because andrew garfield is in it and i
love andrew garfield angels in america

769
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.680
subtitled
a gay fantasia on national themes and

770
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.880
it's very gay it deals with a lot of
very kind of philosophical

771
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:46.000
things you know has god abandoned us
rise of the aids crisis questions of

772
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.280
identity it and and lots of gay
characters none of which are actually

773
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.880
played by gay actors i think but that's
fine because the movie is amazing it's

774
00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:00.480
one of the rare
movies that is very willing to

775
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.960
say just how the reagan
administration was when it came to aids

776
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.839
it is as a movie the hbo movie it was
technically a mini series so it is six

777
00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:14.240
hours long so it is a commitment but it
is worth every minute and you can watch

778
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:18.160
it in hour long chunks because it was
originally aired as six episodes so

779
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.520
angels in america
the last entry

780
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.839
in this tier making thing that i'm doing
is going into slay we're ending on a

781
00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:30.240
high note instead of rent which would
not be ending on a high note despite it

782
00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.799
being a musical and unlike rent which i
don't want to say completely ignored how

783
00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:38.240
terrible aids was angels in america does
not shy away

784
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.720
from pointing out
how

785
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.640
horrible
the aids crisis was that it's not just

786
00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:48.480
oh you get sick and eventually die
through the character of roy cohn and

787
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:55.440
through the character of prior walter
you see how horrible that diagnosis was

788
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.599
what it did to your body and why it
would kind of make you question the

789
00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:03.280
existence of god and when you're kind of
in that situation where you're

790
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.520
questioning it and then literal angels
start coming to you you know what does

791
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.880
that do to your mindset but yeah so that
is the final tear i was expecting there

792
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.040
to be more flops and more homophobic
ones in there but i was feeling generous

793
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.079
the ones in sleigh bird cage bound
cabaret the life and death of marsha p

794
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:26.160
johnson disclosure everything everywhere
all at once hedvig in the angry inch

movies are
there you go you know now and if you've

801
00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:52.720
got some gay movies that aren't listed
here let me know in the comments below

802
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.440
because i would love to watch them
because i love expanding my knowledge of

803
00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.559
gay cinema because most of my gay media
intake recently has been tv shows and

804
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:06.319
anime and so you know recommend the
anime and the tv shows as well

805
00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:09.440
definitely recommend the movies because
maybe there's some good ones that i'm

806
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.160
missing there's definitely some bad ones
that aren't listed but that's not

807
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.280
