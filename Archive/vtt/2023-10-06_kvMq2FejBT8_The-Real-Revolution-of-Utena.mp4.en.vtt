1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.080
this is what happened more or less the
magical girl Trope of anime hit a fever

2
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.080
pitch in the 1990s with the
international phenomenon of Sailor Moon

3
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.800
which typified the style both in homage
and parody these tropes have been

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.960
recreated by artists ever since and have
also become an entire genre in their own

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.880
right whether it's newer magical girls
like P maim Madoka Maga the westernized

6
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.520
magical girls like the cast of Shira and
the princesses of power or the

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.360
genderbent magical boys of cute high
Earth Defense Club the Trope has been a

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.280
staple of animation for decades but none
to my knowledge have been more discussed

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.000
and dissected than the 1997 series
revolutionary girl utena created by

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.600
bapas a production group formed by
director ikuhara kunihiko saoo hasaa

11
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.280
enokido Yoji and uro yiro so let's dive
into into the mesmerizing world of

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.640
Kara's creative Journey you see back in
the 9s iohara graced toi animation with

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.119
his presence during the production of
the Beloved Sailor Moon series he

14
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.720
co-directed the second season Sailor
Moon R alongside sat yichi and took the

15
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.720
helm as the sole director for both the
animated film Sailor Moon R the movie

16
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520
and the third season Sailor Moon s but
Yahara grew Restless in the confines of

17
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.079
adapting existing Works longing for some
creative control thus after the

18
00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.320
conclusion of Sailor Moon s in 1995 he
set forth on a quest to birth an

19
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.320
original series in this endeavor he
assembled the illustrious bapas a

20
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.560
Consortium of creative talents from
anime and manga you see bapas had quite

21
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.680
the history together hasawa and enokido
had previously joined forces with ukara

22
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.000
on Sailor Moon where enokido penned many
episodes featuring the iconic Sailor

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.640
Uranus and Sailor Neptune Bap Papas had
also lent their talents to the esoteric

24
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.119
Neon Genesis Evangelion as for syo she
was a seasoned manga artist who had not

25
00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.719
yet ventured into the realm of anime now
initially iohara envisioned utena as a

26
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.640
mainstream showjoe series hoping to ride
the coales of Sailor Moon's commercial

27
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.200
success in fact they began with a
concept titled revolutionary girl utena

28
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.720
kiss featuring a group of valiant female
warriors known as the Neo elanar

29
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.239
Eleganza
Extravaganza battling the enigmatic end

30
00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.800
of the world but as the creativity
flowed they settled on a different path

31
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.640
a romantic action show starring a pretty
girl who wears boys clothes the school

32
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.519
setting was a Cornerstone of anime but
other elements like the duels and the

33
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.280
Mysterious Rose rde were yet to enter
the plot as bapas commenced their

34
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.879
six-month planning phase after syo's
arrival they delved into the

35
00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.599
nitty-gritty of the story World building
and the intricate process of translating

36
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.879
syo's visual style into anime in
parallel Sao embarked on creating a

37
00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.480
manga adaptation of aenna while still
contributing her expertise to the

38
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.599
anime's development now a fascinating
tidbit here is that while lutena

39
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.519
inevitably carries Echoes of Princess
Knight and the rose of versailes to shjo

40
00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.799
manga series known for their
crossdressing sword fighting heroins

41
00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.480
ikuhara was persistently apprehensive
about being seen merely as a parody of

42
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.120
these iconic works sitto on the other
hand was brought in to be Papas

43
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.920
primarily because the team wanted a
female perspective to avoid

44
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.720
unintentionally parodying Shojo manga
Shojo manga is manga that's aimed at

45
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.000
Young Girls by the way fast forward to
1996 with syo's manga adaptation of

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.920
utena underway negotiations for the
broadcast of the utena anime were

47
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.920
finally sealed and production began in
Earnest bapas took the Reigns of

48
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.239
production with the esteemed JC staff
handling animation duties but here's

49
00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.760
where the story takes a Twist iohara
vision for utena underwent a profound

50
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.239
transformation once the series commenced
production no longer content with aiming

51
00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.280
for Mass Market success he decided to
infuse the series with a unique

52
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.879
non-commercial identity this shift saw
the incorporation of avangard elements

53
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.120
such as theatrical inspired layouts
Shadow plays that offer commentary on

54
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.519
each episode's events and the
experimental Coral compositions of Ja

55
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.079
Cesar as production Advanced tensions
simmered within bopus the series veered

56
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.000
away from its original commercial
trajectory creating what agoro described

57
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.280
as a tug-of-war between Sao and ukara
Sao ardently championed the initial

58
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.080
romantic concept for Anna over ikuhara
increasingly esoteric Vision they even

59
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.160
reached a point where they didn't speak
to each other for 3 months straight

60
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.880
sao's concern you see was not
ideological but pragmatic she believed

61
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.800
the mainstream shjo audience might not
Embrace anything other than a

62
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.320
traditional male female romance iohara
however kept the full extent of his

63
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.520
intended same-sex romance between utena
and anthy Under Wraps throughout most of

64
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.759
the production ultimately syto supported
the way the series handled the

65
00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.039
relationship between the characters
nothing succeeds like success since then

66
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.120
revolutionary girl lutena has garnered A
Chorus of Praise both at home in Japan

67
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.160
and across the International stage for
all that Sailor Moon takes the Lion

68
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.680
Share of public discussion utena's
influence can be felt in the development

69
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.280
of anime to this very day in 1997 the
series won the coveted animation Kobe

70
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.600
award for the best television category
and as the years rolled on in 2017 NHK

71
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.639
the network behind utena conducted a
national poll to determine the 100

72
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.600
greatest anime in commemoration of the H
100th an iversary of the medium in which

73
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.759
utena placed 19th utena has graced
multiple best of lists with his presence

74
00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.240
anime Insider hailed it as one of the
top 10 best anime ever writer Mike tulle

75
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.600
in his review declared the series to be
the most important anime of the

76
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.919
9s however with all this hype about
it what is revolutionary girl

77
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.479
utena actually about get comfortable
because that's not an easy question to

78
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.960
answer and things get
[Music]

79
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.039
weird revolutionary girl lutena is
divided into three sagas the student

80
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.479
council Saga the Black Rose Saga and The
climactic akori Saga or the apocalypse

81
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.240
Arc depending upon the release uten
atenu is a middle school student and

82
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.840
it's very very important to remember
that she's a middle school student

83
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.160
throughout the series and the movie to
say that she struggles to keep up good

84
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.759
grades is UN fair to her because she
doesn't really seem to care about that

85
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.639
stuff or anything that is in sports or
her friends she is as we would describe

86
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.520
a tomboy and a subject of simultaneous
jealousy Fascination and desire from

87
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.880
almost everyone in the school as a child
utena lost both of her parents in an

88
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.599
undescribed accident she managed to pull
herself together due to a quote unquote

89
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:57.360
chance encounter with an individual she
described as a prince he gave her a rose

90
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.080
engraved Signet ring with the promise
that it would help them meet again in

91
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.879
the future though she admits her memory
on this is a bit foggy she doesn't even

92
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:09.520
quite remember what her prince looked
like probably not what this Prince was

93
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.879
intending utena didn't fall madly in
love with him per se though she has

94
00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:18.720
lived out her youth in anticipation of
one day meeting him instead she decides

95
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.360
that she will one day also become a
prince like him to save the imperil

96
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.400
princesses of the world just as the rose
Prince had once saved her as an audience

97
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400
you really don't have any idea how
important this is until like the last

98
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.879
five episodes maybe even the last two
until then it simply seems to be a

99
00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.879
backstory that drives utena to enroll in
the prestigious and exclusive otori

100
00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:44.840
Academy there she is the source of
Wonder for the girls a source of Envy

101
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.960
for all the boys and a source of
confusion for all the teachers she acts

102
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.560
and dresses like a boy and is noted for
her Fierce sense of justice and

103
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.240
dignified nobility spying a shy and
reclusive anthy Hima being slapped by

104
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.319
her boyfriend she intervenes on what she
believes is anthy's behalf oh I

105
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.639
challenge you to a duel anthy is a piece
in a very complicated game of chess that

106
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.560
focuses around this school's enigmatic
student council this befits a beloved

107
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.599
anime Trope of the high school student
council holding a position of political

108
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:17.039
power that can rival a small government
anthy has a secret double life as the

109
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:21.280
rose bride and the student council is so
interested in her because the rosebride

110
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.879
is the key to unlocking a power that can
revolutionize the world the one who is

111
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:30.520
engaged to the rosebride can access this
power and bring about Revolution

112
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.519
presumably to suit their own whims the
rose bride becomes engaged to whomever

113
00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:38.760
can best her current betroth in a duel
utena wins a duel with the student

114
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.880
council vice president to stop him from
hitting anthy so utena becomes anthy's

115
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.839
New Groom to be just works like that and
this makes sense compared to everything

116
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:53.399
that follows it don't worry it gets
weirder the key to these duels are the

117
00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:57.880
Signet Rings which at present only
members of the student council wear the

118
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.519
student council is
not pleased that they've lost their

119
00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:07.200
ability to shape the world of the future
and seek to get anthy back from utena

120
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.720
with the help or perhaps at the whim of
a mysterious benefactor codenamed end of

121
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.399
the world the Japanese version is more
clearly translated to apocalypse I'm

122
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:20.839
told but was not used in English because
of the apparent close ties to religious

123
00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:28.440
overtones nomy you like girls more than
boys yes listen nomy God created men and

124
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.800
women for a reason reason that reason
being that they join in the best sort of

125
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.680
way no matter how good something may
feel going against God's plan what are

126
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.000
you implying Big Brother you know you're
the only one that I

127
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
love utena threw her close connection
and apparent engagement to Ane works at

128
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.160
coaching Ane to think for herself an
unfortunate drawback of the rosebride is

129
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.760
that the rosebride can only ever do or
feel the way that she is instructed to

130
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.240
by her betrothed even as her bridegroom
utna tirelessly coaches anthy to

131
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.000
advocate for her own needs and her own
feelings and to do what she wants rather

132
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.519
than what her magical husband person to
be tells her I'm sure tops of all

133
00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:14.320
genders can identify with both the irony
and endless struggle of trying to coax

134
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.600
their bottoms into being less
subservient in the first Arc we see the

135
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.839
various reasons that the members of the
student council would want to use the

136
00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:25.160
power of Revolution her winning streak
against all of them is brought to an end

137
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.640
when the student council president toga
tricks utena into believing that he is

138
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.120
the Rose Prince from her childhood
though after utena finds her courage

139
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.480
again she defeats him handedly the first
Arc is privy to a number

140
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.800
of oddities outside of the premise of
dueling in the upside down floating

141
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.800
Castle in the Sky where eternity lies
with the power to bring Revolution to

142
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.600
the world toa's younger sister nmy seems
to have a bit of a complex like a very

143
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.000
strong fixation that by far
exceeds protective but don't worry it

144
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.839
does get
weirder the first Arc does a lot of the

145
00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:04.160
heavy lifting in terms of establishing
the rules of the world and the themes

146
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.519
running through the whole series
subsequent plot arcs just get deeper and

147
00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:14.360
more unsettling truth be told the second
Arc doesn't really do much to elaborate

148
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.320
on the plot though it is important for
establishing some guiding mechanics of

149
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.200
this world as well as introducing some
key players for the ongoing series

150
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.880
through a plot divised to kill the rose
bride and replace her we see a

151
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.160
recurrence of the same weapons the
student council used to challenge and

152
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.120
Jenna we had seen the sword of dios a
powerful weapon and the key to the power

153
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.200
of Revolution being removed from anthy's
chest in her capacity as the rosebride

154
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.000
and this seems to be her primary role as
the rosebride just as anthy's body hosts

155
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
the sword of dios initially each student
council member hosts their own blade in

156
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.399
the third Arc however anony no longer is
host to the sword of dios instead she

157
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:58.040
draws a blade from utena's body that's
important keep that in mind we get to it

158
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.120
later the other primary element of the
second Arc is introducing anthy's

159
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.240
brother AIO and hey if you thought nomy
and toga stuff was a little weird we got

160
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.240
a couple episodes into the second Arc
with AIO and Ane and like yeah they're

161
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:18.600
uh
yeah anthy come

162
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.320
here I really don't want another content
strike from YouTube I already have one

163
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.760
so as graphic as this is I am simply
going to to euphemize and refer to it as

164
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.360
domestic abuse Akio is the principal
villain of the series and was both end

165
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.120
of the world as well as the rose prince
who gave utena her ring which drawing a

166
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.920
parallel to utena's duel with toga
akio's primary objective seems to be to

167
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.720
feminize utena and groom her because
utena is under the impression that she's

168
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.120
basically promised herself to the prince
from her childhood she is magnetically

169
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.639
drawn to him this naturally causes anthy
to Fester due to being so gaslit her

170
00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.040
whole life that she feels her only sense
of value is to be of service to men

171
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.000
something that utena is interrupting and
the once best friends develop a toxic

172
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.560
rivalry I put a lot of poison in your
tea you don't say as one does the girls

173
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.800
appear to resolve their differences when
utena rescues anthy from an unal living

174
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.199
attempt and acknowledges that this is
kind of completely up after a

175
00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.240
final stab at gaslighting utena into
believing that it's her time to shed her

176
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.320
juvenile boyish fantasies and be a
proper lady to be valuable to him and

177
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.839
presumably by extension societ at large
utena challenges Akio to a duel for

178
00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:37.440
anthy's fate Akio basically says that
the dueling rules are different now a

179
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.480
because he'll straight up murder her if
she loses and B because the dueling

180
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.720
Arena may or may not have existed and
may have been a hologram this whole time

181
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.360
but don't worry we've yet to hit the
summit of weird Mountain guarding anthy

182
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.399
from her brother utena is stabbed in the
back by anthy who upon the command of

183
00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:57.880
her brother has accepted that it's
simply her role in life to suffer

184
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.360
according to a man who has been
domestically abusing his own sister for

185
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.399
who knows how long Akio claims that she
has chosen this and that she's happy

186
00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:13.360
like this and now she actually enjoys
living in this pathetic tortured role

187
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.880
she can no longer be happy except like
this looking at real world parallels a

188
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.519
given individual can endure much less
debilitating physical and psychological

189
00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:28.880
trauma and be ruled as unfit by the
state to make their own decisions there

190
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.959
are a number of other hints and
instances in the plot that strongly

191
00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:36.040
indicate that anthy's willpower is so
eroded that she has no sense of

192
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.399
self-preservation whatsoever and is
emotionally stunted to the point where

193
00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:44.079
she needs people to make decisions for
her because she does not know how to

194
00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:49.079
think for herself something that utena
has been trying to get her to realize

195
00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:53.040
about herself this whole time with anthy
being stabbed by the swords of hatred

196
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.399
probably men's hatred it's symbolic or
not we'll talk about it Akio takes the

197
00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:01.160
sword from utena and tries to open the
door that guards the power to

198
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.360
revolutionize the world and finally oops
it broke not that it really matters what

199
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.199
can you possibly get for the man who has
everything Whiskey

200
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:15.639
Stones it's not like any of this really
mattered it's fine Lenna meanwhile

201
00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:20.480
desperately claws at the rose thorns
that guard the power of revolution in a

202
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.040
sheer refusal to give up on anony for
which I'm sure there's a heterosexual

203
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.959
explanation somehow and in a final
attempt to free anony from the cofin of

204
00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:33.839
her psyche the floor gives out and utena
is left wounded defeated and at the

205
00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:39.000
mercy of all the swords that Akio forced
upon anthy so that they would not attack

206
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.160
him Flash Forward a few weeks and utena
is not in school and all of the students

207
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.600
have begun to forget her save for anthy
and AIA the latter is disappointed that

208
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.680
utena never managed to use the power to
revolutionize the world and begins a new

209
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.440
scheme to try it all again anthy however
declares that she'll have no part of

210
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.319
this and next to a bewildered brother
announces that she's leaving otori

211
00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:08.519
Academy to find aenna the manga and the
movie have some vast differences but

212
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:12.360
maintain the overall themes this is
primarily going to cover the anime but

213
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.120
will include some elements of the movie
in order to elaborate on themes because

214
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.319
on top of what I just narrated there's a
whole mythology and some magic realism

215
00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:27.240
and anmy in general that is going on at
the same time and specifically in the

216
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.800
realm of magic realism the sword of Dos
dos himself the upside down Castle

217
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.560
anthy's magic and backstory as a witch
and just a whole lot more I am going to

218
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.800
drop some bombs because my reading of
revolutionary girl Lenna seems to be

219
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.959
vastly different than the bulk of the
discourse I have found not to mention

220
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:50.279
the actual Wikipedia page and sure you
could take it literally you could assume

221
00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:55.639
that Doos was the former incarnation of
AIO who was transformed SL imprisoned by

222
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:59.839
anthy who is a witch a damsel in
distress and also simultaneously the

223
00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:03.040
vesage of all men's hatred who
desperately want Prince Doos to deflower

224
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.480
their daughter and that's not outside
the realm of normal for anime or we can

225
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.039
observe revolutionary girl Lieutenant as
a deeply allegorical and symbolic story

226
00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:15.039
about the struggles of coming of age
amidst widespread institutional

227
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:19.480
corruption in a high school and which
describes a passive culture of inaction

228
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.760
in regard to Brazen instances of
domestic exploitation in which there is

229
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.480
not only a question about the capore
reality of the events transpiring but

230
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.080
also which events can be taken for
granted and which events are meant to

231
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.840
signify abstract sociological
institutions which may be otherwise

232
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.480
difficult to articulate in fiction which
is quite frankly a lot more effort but

233
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.830
unfortunately we have postmodernism so I
guess we have to

234
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:54.080
[Music]
try postmodernism is a literary artistic

235
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.559
and philosophical school of thought
something something Wikipedia uses big

236
00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:01.880
words what you need to know is that
postmodernism is a response to the

237
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.200
modernism movement which hit its peak in
the 1920s it's complicated there was a

238
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.960
lot of overlap especially when looking
at areas of study which began to shift

239
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.120
away from the modernist movement
architecture was the first area to

240
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.760
significantly adapt a style that would
be referred to as postmodern in contrast

241
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.120
to the modernists postmodernism is
rooted heavily in relativism and

242
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.559
implores a rejection of stable and
concrete let alone Universal truths due

243
00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:32.120
to the focus around ephemerality
identity and especially the ways that

244
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.000
identity may be concealed or altered in
a world which is chronically changing

245
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.520
revolutionary girl lutena conforms
miraculously to this school of thought

246
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.320
and quite frankly it seems to be a
shining Exemplar of presenting these

247
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.120
tenants in a way that is clear though
compelling enough to be more than just a

248
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.600
textbook case this is considered one of
the most significant and influential

249
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.720
animes of the '90s for a very good
reason now it's easy to see how this

250
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.559
anime fits into a postmodern framework
from the theme alone you've got a bunch

251
00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:05.039
of teenagers who are not only struggling
with ways to project their true selves

252
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:09.840
into the world but also struggling to
reconcile what that true self even is

253
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.240
there is an ongoing discussion about
gender developing sexuality Coming of

254
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.200
Age direct and indirect challenges to
establish values a question of Truth

255
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.760
Versus illusion a distrust of therapy
that feels at home with Scientology and

256
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.760
ultimately a threat of losing oneself in
a sea of modernity that's lowercase

257
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.480
modernity by the way prominent in
postmodern writing are unreliable

258
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.400
narrators imagery of mirrors masks being
trapped in Lial spaces a use of glitter

259
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.440
to describe seemingly important things
of little value and a strong prominence

260
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.720
of feminist ideals and themes given the
post-modernism not to be confused with

261
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.880
postmodernity which is a different thing
kind of seems to hold a particular focus

262
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.880
on the appearance versus reality of
something and also challenging the

263
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.600
belief of objective truth second W
feminism felt very at home when

264
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.440
post-modern thought made its way into
literature by the 19 60s the two could

265
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.200
often be spoken of in the same breath
they both Drew roots from the rise of

266
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.799
existentialist thought that endured the
second world war spurred by an

267
00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:11.120
intellectual school of thought that
placed importance on the self and

268
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.919
developing a sense of self-worth based
on action rather than Birthright or

269
00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:18.600
strictly through Labor also unfortunate
is that existentialism was a primary

270
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.520
influence for Aon Rand and her school of
objectivism still an ongoing Trend

271
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.640
within stories with a female lead was
that in order to frame The Narrative

272
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.480
towards emotional validation The
Narrative needed to contain the typical

273
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.880
post-modern elements of social
destabilization which leads us back to

274
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.679
utena where the very plot is about
Revolution and whether or not a

275
00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:42.919
tomboyish young girl has the ability or
the right to be responsible for it but

276
00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:46.799
you're here for the hot takes right what
does this have to do with that

277
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:51.360
throughout utena there is both an
element of magic realism juxtaposed

278
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.440
against the reality of High School drama
in spite of the fact that these are high

279
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.240
school students they fight Grand fencing
duels in a stadium in the sky where an

280
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.600
inverted Castle floats above the student
council has this anxious anticipation

281
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.799
about their ability to self-actualize an
anxieties about growing up while at the

282
00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.000
same time carrying the kind of weight
and Authority one would expect from

283
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.760
feudal politics it's like Game of
Thrones with Minik skirts in my reading

284
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.720
of otna there is very little that we can
verifiably say is not symbolic or

285
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.360
directly allegorical of something this
anime incorporates nearly every

286
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.320
significant icon of postmodern language
it would be wrong to assume that this is

287
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.360
not deeply allegorical what have we just
going to take the doo stuff seriously

288
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.320
when it serves the plot much more
significantly to say that the background

289
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.440
mythology is meant to characterize the
way these characters interact my reading

290
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.600
of this media is that there isn't a
whole lot we can take at face value and

291
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.279
much much more that we can assume is
Fantastical illusion meant to convey

292
00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:51.400
deeper meaning about what the author has
to say about power abuse control

293
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.720
schooling and Adolescence in general
especially because the final two

294
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.720
episodes strongly imply even
misleadingly that everything Fantastical

295
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.600
about this story from the duels the
castle the power of Doos was an illusion

296
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.320
projected by Holograms though in the
same breath where AIO explains that

297
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.400
people see a castle because they're too
naive to see the power of the Chairman's

298
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.360
residence they see the more literal
power of a castle Akio doesn't seem to

299
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.799
question himself at all and whether or
not the Chairman's office is an illusion

300
00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:21.720
he is choosing to see in a discourse on
power it's very heavily implied that the

301
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.000
Chairman's Authority is representative
of a broader definition of higher

302
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.960
authority evidence of his own
self-deception is that he too buys into

303
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.760
the fantasy of the power of Doos which
seems to reside exclusively in this room

304
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.360
of Illusions and therefore where he
failed to breach the door to that power

305
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.279
with a sword he drew from utena's chest
utena accomplishes this all on her own

306
00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:50.000
so if we are dealing with a plot that is
primarily an

307
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.360
illusion then how are we supposed to
interpret what was going on at all and

308
00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:04.279
more importantly what does it all mean
[Music]

309
00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:08.400
the weird thing about an analysis like
this is that you kind of have to gauge

310
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.880
what this anime is actually about before
you begin to look for supporting

311
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.400
instances something tricky about utena
is that some things are allegorically

312
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.400
coded and other things are meant to be
taken a face value it's not always clear

313
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.200
which is meant to be which a basic
premise is that uten atenu is a middle

314
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.480
school student who is struggling to
navigate adolescence if we assume that

315
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.320
this is is real as the more Universal
experience that a young lady can expect

316
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.080
in her life then all elements outside
the realm of normal can be seen as

317
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.440
symbolic reflections of struggles that
middle school students will go through

318
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.600
especially because all discourse around
the duels and the rosebride and the

319
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.080
floating Castle in the Sky are not
accessible to most of the student body

320
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.320
only the student council and a handful
of students know about these things the

321
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.000
rest of the students are
just students this creates a broad yet

322
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.640
clearly defined separation between the
Fantastical events events and the

323
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.720
literal ones and this is also primarily
why I prefer the anime to the movie The

324
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.840
separation between reality and illusion
is a little bit more defined whereas in

325
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.679
the movie adolescence of utena students
participated in these duels as the

326
00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:15.039
audience it makes the symbolism of
everything around anthy a little bit

327
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:19.039
more literal except when you get to the
whole cars thing that said the movie was

328
00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:22.840
much less about the question of identity
and more about escaping the oppressive

329
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:28.159
elements of conformity in school the
movie itself I view as more of a compan

330
00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:32.360
piece to the anime beefing up secondary
thematic messaging that was present in

331
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.240
the anime and clarifying some character
motivations for instance toa's romantic

332
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.320
feelings for utena were genuine and that
shiori really is just that that bad

333
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.120
though utena's revamped design was a
great Improvement I felt granted the

334
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.320
whole movie is just gorgeous painting
the school as an mcer esque prison of

335
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.919
militant Conformity it's also just a lot
gayer there's a reason why I chose to

336
00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:58.120
focus on the anime specifically both the
film and the manga are worth their own

337
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.640
analysis each the only major overlapping
symbol is that cars represent adulthood

338
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.399
and passage into adulthood a problem
with postmodern analysis is that

339
00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:11.960
symbolic language and what is presented
as real events can often be overlapping

340
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.000
an element of realism is important in
most stories as most audiences need

341
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.840
these real events to identify within
their own lives in order to empathize

342
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.559
with the characters there is a degree of
uncertainty when gauging analysis and

343
00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:27.720
the temptation to assume that everything
is symbolic which I feel gives a lot of

344
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.520
undo complexity to work that is
otherwise meant to just be

345
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.120
straightforward to bring up an example
nobody's going to expect and I mean

346
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.720
nobody look at the music video for
Wrecking Ball by Miley Cyrus I do like

347
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.080
Miley but this one was a bit of a Miss
she responded to criticism of the video

348
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.840
describing it as weird and unnecessary
by claiming that the whole Lick in the

349
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.159
hammer thing was symbolic of a failed
relationship or something a problem with

350
00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:52.919
the video is that it is under the
assumption that the audience is going to

351
00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:57.799
read these visuals as symbolic without
the music video itself doing anything to

352
00:25:57.799 --> 00:26:02.000
suggest that these things are symbolic
the lyrics also don't do a whole lot to

353
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.679
play off of the housebreaking imagery of
a wrecking ball besides that one line

354
00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:10.960
the end result is a weird sexual trist
with inanimate construction site objects

355
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.760
which seems to be playing off of nothing
but the song but that's a Creator

356
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.000
assuming that Their audience will read
symbolism into their work without prompt

357
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.279
it can work in the other direction too
taking Lord of the Rings as an example

358
00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:26.600
and this is entirely hypothetical it
would be like saying that Aragorn

359
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.600
kicking the orc helmet and crying out in
anguish is symbolic of his rejection of

360
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.360
Regal responsibilities resulting in the
suffering of those around him no he's

361
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.520
kicking a helmet because he's frustrated
that he's misplaced his Hobbits and

362
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.760
screaming because vgo mortson
accidentally broke his foot kicking that

363
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.120
helmet now if the plot made a specific
point of Aragorn repeatedly kicking or

364
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.279
pushing objects away from him with due
consequences then yes we could say that

365
00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:00.240
this action carries symbolic weight but
only only if it's repeated and only if

366
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.480
through repetition the audience can see
evolution in Aragorn's internal conflict

367
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.399
and unfortunately there aren't any solid
rules about when we should observe an

368
00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:13.200
action or element as symbolic and when
we should dismiss it as taken for

369
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.679
granted because if you want to establish
a rule then some author at some point in

370
00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:20.159
history has made a masterpiece textbook
example of a symbolic device that breaks

371
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:25.159
that rule the primary reason that AI
will never be able to replace artists is

372
00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:28.600
because the collection of values that
are used to present literary devices can

373
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.399
shift from one artist to the next it's a
matter of Merit to have the kind of

374
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:36.240
creative judgment to discern how an
audience will interpret literary devices

375
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.159
and in the language of each individual
author there is a variable ability to

376
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:47.919
present meaning in variable ways using
variable methods tldr if there's a rule

377
00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:52.080
then it would not be art the quality of
an artist is gauged by their ability not

378
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.120
only to make their own rules but to
efficiently project that set of rules to

379
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.840
Their audience we live in a world world
where Watchmen carry slaughterhouse 5

380
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.640
and The Color Purple are all considered
post-modern masterpieces yet their

381
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.360
syntactic mechanics narrative structure
and even their very underlying

382
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.600
philosophies are foundationally
different though in utena there seems to

383
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.399
be one side character who is able to
appropriately frame the realism from the

384
00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:20.799
symbolism though she's in less than
about half of the total episodes utena's

385
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.399
best friend wakaba is the most important
character for Discerning what is meant

386
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:30.399
to be symbolic wakaba is a regular girl
whose incredibly gay and not at all

387
00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:34.000
involved in the component of dueling
that takes place in the school wakaba

388
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.600
sees conflict between the dualists but
not the duels themselves she's the

389
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.600
cipher character with whom the audience
can appreciate what the average student

390
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.960
would see I would argue that whatever
wakaba sees is what the audience can

391
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.279
take for granted is the reality of
what's transpiring everything else

392
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:53.960
including very personal moments such as
anthy's attempted unal living and even

393
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.600
including things that happen in the real
world such as school teacher sexual

394
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.720
exploiting his female students can be
read as symbolic representations of

395
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.039
something more abstract and even if we
do read those aformentioned issues as

396
00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:10.559
real that doesn't also mean that they
can't carry additional symbolic value to

397
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:15.919
a larger abstract concept they're just
very well-developed Concepts and because

398
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:19.600
of wakaba we can approach them with
uncertainty rather than confusion this

399
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.399
is the principle of my thoughts on
Attack on Titan where I felt that things

400
00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:28.279
that fans and detractors argued were
symbolic were just too messy and

401
00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:32.840
inconsistent and contradictory to be set
in stone allegories okay this is a world

402
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.039
where people can get bone marrow
injections and turn into giant monsters

403
00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:40.279
who depending on the circumstances may
or may not have sentient reasoning based

404
00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:45.159
on an ambiguous rule of genetic Heritage
but also magic 2 at this point if

405
00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:48.320
anything goes World building Attack on
Titan goes out of its way to establish

406
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.640
that weird happens in this world
and can be accepted as fact rather than

407
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.120
allegory whereas revolutionary girl
lutena does not do that which is

408
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.480
something something you could accept
about utena except for wakaba who yes

409
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.600
participates in one duel but she was
brainwashed and has no recollection of

410
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.919
it wakaba is the element ofnormal in
this cast things that happen in her

411
00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:13.760
awareness are certain wakaba is like us
the audience we don't pull Weaponry out

412
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.679
of random people or have uncommon hair
colors I'm sorry almost none of us are

413
00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:22.120
main characters in an anime and
therefore what happens outside of waba's

414
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.440
awareness is subject to discourse on
Truth or Illusion because of wakaba we

415
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.640
can read some of the more weird things
in this plot as symbolic and not just

416
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.880
absurd not that utena doesn't have some
absurd things but even something

417
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.679
seemingly benign and uselessly cute like
cho cho serves to help characterize

418
00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:44.760
anthy as a sympathetic character who is
earnest in her sensitivity rather than

419
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.840
at being a front to help her brother
groom girls at the school cares about

420
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.039
animals is the tried andrue method in
anime of signifying that the audience

421
00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:57.039
ought to empathize with a given
character okay Mr we're studying

422
00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:01.960
so so I'll have to see you later did you
like eating that mean old snake but

423
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.250
there's a lot more to dig into than
simple

424
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:13.519
[Music]
symbology probably the most prominent

425
00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:18.559
symbol in the entire show is the sword
of dios aside from being the key that

426
00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:22.919
gives access to the power of Revolution
it is made symbolic by how it is

427
00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:27.240
acquired it being removed from anthy's
chest can be read as symbolic rather

428
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.399
other than your average magical girl
transformation stock footage it's very

429
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:34.480
easy in any work of fiction to observe
weapons as symbols of power this is

430
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.559
almost Universal what's a little more
creative is when a Creator questions

431
00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:42.799
what a weapon is so given that a small
yet significant collection of the

432
00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:46.559
student body run around spontaneously
pulling swords out of their chesticles

433
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:50.120
this isn't something that we can really
dismiss the power to revolutionize the

434
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.399
world is hidden behind a gate for which
the sword of Dos is the key to access in

435
00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:59.200
order to get this power dualists usually
men need to extract this power from the

436
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.840
body of a woman however they do not
possess this power on their own they

437
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.279
need a woman as an accessory to their
Ambitions even if the ambition is to

438
00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:13.519
protect the woman granted it probably
should not get lost on us that dios

439
00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:17.320
means god in Latin and a number of other
romance languages even in the Japanese

440
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.559
language versions he's called dios and
I'm not going to get too deep into that

441
00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:24.000
especially with the language of
apocalypse and Revolution that's a whole

442
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.279
master's degree dissertation right there
however the figure of Dio as a character

443
00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:32.320
is important to the plot and in my
opinion a rather contentious one a

444
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.120
surface level reading of Doos is that he
is either a god a reflection of a god a

445
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.919
prince who died ages ago or a collection
of household insects given material form

446
00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:44.600
by anthy depending on the version of
your story now yes if you want to you

447
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.159
can look at him like that and that who
he was is now a spectre that resides in

448
00:32:49.159 --> 00:32:53.120
the sword Andor Castle he is the figure
who gave utena her signant ring and

449
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.880
inspired her to become a prince and he
is not AIO though can be read as and is

450
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.480
occasionally a reflection of AIO for all
that dios is approached with the

451
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.919
language of the Christian God akio's
name is derived from a Japanese

452
00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:10.200
character used in the name for Venus the
Morning Star which is associated with

453
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.760
Lucifer Lucifer which is dare I say a
misappropriated name for Satan Lucifer

454
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.440
instead originally referred to a Persian
God Of The Morning Light and Satan

455
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.639
actually means the accuser not the devil
he was God's prosecutor not his enemy

456
00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:28.720
Frenemies but anyway religion and anime
fun so yes the literal reading is there

457
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.000
but that's boring when there's so much
symbolism of foot dios is simply more

458
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.760
useful as a tool to explain the
motivations of characters that do exist

459
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.440
than as a character himself when a
character is a character but is not a

460
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.039
character but represents an internal
character foil that prends to their

461
00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:52.200
identity that may be a figurative mask
but a mask nevertheless so dos doesn't

462
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.279
exist not strictly he exists as a
concept given a name the concept cept is

463
00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:01.600
nobility chivalry and power the subject
of nobility is also noteworthy in utena

464
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.760
the prince of roses as a concept seems
to hold a different meaning to each

465
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.240
character to aenna the prince is the
archetype of the nobility she wants to

466
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.960
represent one may even say a transition
icon if you want to adopt that reading

467
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.320
of utena however additional instances of
castles princesses damsels and evil

468
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.800
witches also enrich this symbolic
language the castle may be an illusion

469
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.720
kind of AIO says it is but then hinges
his entire plan on breaking open an

470
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.040
illusion door so
I don't

471
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:36.480
[Music]
know the castle itself represents a

472
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.839
curious element of the story's Politics
on gender the final leg of the third Arc

473
00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:44.879
heavily deals with AIO attempting to
convince utena to put down the sword and

474
00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:49.240
be a proper lady which utena feels
compelled to do nearly everyone who sees

475
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.839
the upside down Castle wants to go there
to make all their dreams come true

476
00:34:52.839 --> 00:34:57.200
whatever those dreams may be it makes it
easy for someone like Akio to manipulate

477
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.640
others under the promise that he can
make those dreams a reality what's

478
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.839
noteworthy is that the castle is
tantalizing but it's also inaccessible

479
00:35:06.839 --> 00:35:11.560
it is in fact only accessible through
engagement to the Rose bride the reality

480
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.760
of this Castle is challenged by two
things first yes that Akio claims that

481
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.760
it's an illusion an illusion within an
illusion one could say very Inception

482
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.800
but also that it is upside down we know
from the study of symbols that when a

483
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.040
given symbol is inverted it holds an
opposite meaning take a castle what does

484
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.359
it represent monarchy regality nobility
safety and fantasy a castle as a symbol

485
00:35:35.359 --> 00:35:39.560
if inverted still carries those values
but instead becomes an ironic subversion

486
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.040
of those values it's the difference
between saying a castle wall is meant to

487
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.720
keep the bride safe or maybe that it's
meant to keep her imprisoned an inverted

488
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.920
Castle says the latter it's also
significant that as utena faces Akio in

489
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.200
this climactic confrontation she begins
to understand the ways that her

490
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.200
childhood fantasies of princes and
princesses have been used to manipulate

491
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:07.240
her into being just a girl her
realization is marked by the upside down

492
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.560
Castle's collapse the symbolic language
of this Castle is a bit different in

493
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.400
adolescence of utena while it seems to
be a grand magnificent Castle it's

494
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.720
actually a giant tank underneath whose
shifting wheels and Treads form a

495
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.800
labyrinth that one is not meant to
escape and in the movie as in the anime

496
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.400
AIO is directly related to this castle
and the princely figure of Doos this

497
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.480
becomes more significant through the
third Arc to AIO dos uniquely represents

498
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.839
who he believes he is and who he feels
other people ought to see him as an

499
00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:42.400
illusion he himself buys into so
strongly that others also believe it

500
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.760
Dio's story is told several different
ways by several different characters and

501
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.119
no story is entirely consistent the
common Trend in his Fable however is

502
00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:56.319
that he has a sister he seeks a damsel
in distress and that he is tricked by a

503
00:36:56.319 --> 00:37:02.359
witch and imprisoned all of these
figures are anthy at the same time Dio's

504
00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:07.000
imprisonment Andor death as a result of
the witch's actions even though her

505
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.599
motivations range from malicious to
oblivious seems to be what every version

506
00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:16.720
of this story frames as the root cause
for all the world's problems the world

507
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.440
still hadn't Fallen completely Into
Darkness then the reason for this was

508
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.680
because there was a rose Prince not only
is Akio a victim for having his God

509
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.640
could removed but the whole of the world
is worse off for it and that through his

510
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.640
intention to use the power of Revolution
he will re-empower himself to his

511
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.079
rightful status as someone
who has the ability to do anything he

512
00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:42.560
wants without
consequences which is going to make the

513
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.200
world a better place because returning
his power to him is Poetic Justice

514
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.040
returning to him something that he lost
and all of this has been to say that the

515
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.960
role of dios is for Akio to betray his
internal motivations to the audience it

516
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.960
is her punishment for taking the prince
away from the girls of the world so

517
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.720
through a postmodern lens we can use
this to characterize AIO to offer

518
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.960
context for his actions in his mind he
is dios and his version of dios offered

519
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.520
himself to the world and the world's
princesses and the world was better for

520
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.280
it within the shadow play there is
language to suggest that he had the

521
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.560
ability to fight monsters to protect
people in akio's elaboration later on in

522
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.680
the same episode it subtly implied that
Doos gets power from deflowering the

523
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.960
princesses of the world and by the wi
taking away his unbridled ability to get

524
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.079
his dick wet he lost his ability to
maintain peace and order in the world

525
00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:41.520
his exploitation of anthy in that light
is a means by which he can recover the

526
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.760
power he perceives she stole from him in
the most postmodern way possible this is

527
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.520
what I mean when I said that this might
not even be literal exploitation because

528
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.599
this kind of demonstration can be
extrapolated to indicate any kind of

529
00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.280
power and balance in this relationship
this can signify any kind of control or

530
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.640
abuse but the instance of exploitation
here is used because assault has Deep

531
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:09.359
Roots as indicating that akio's gender
is the source of his imbalance however

532
00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:12.960
there is also an invitation to observe
this conflict of princes damsels and

533
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.000
witches as itself representative of a
greater cultural hole the plot outlines

534
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.240
that exploitation of all kinds is
damaging not just the sexual instances

535
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.599
outlined here and how in the situation
of a life's worth of gaslighting someone

536
00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:29.680
can actively believe that their only
role in life is to be a victim people

537
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.000
generally feel good when they are
reassured of their self existing in the

538
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.160
world when you have been told that
yourself is to be a victim over time

539
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.640
your brain can cross those wires
suddenly victimhood feels good because

540
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.240
you get that positive reassurance
dopamine hit ane's Conformity to the

541
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.880
Rose bride is based around the fact that
she feels good being subservient because

542
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.079
this is the only thing in her life that
has ever brought her any kind of

543
00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:58.240
positive reward it takes the entire
series iies for utena to shake her out

544
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.240
of this mindset and she begins to see
herself as her own person and the really

545
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.640
cool thing is that we're now at a point
of analysis where we can get to the

546
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.880
exciting stuff because the language of
plurality it can apply to these

547
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.000
characters themselves so that we're not
just talking about AIO anthy and oena

548
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.079
but the ways that AIO is a standin for
every man and that Ane represents every

549
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:28.079
victim and that utena represents a kind
of a woman so we arrive at a game state

550
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:31.920
where men seek the power of Revolution
to facilitate their control over women

551
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.760
which they already have mostly in order
to return to times when things were

552
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.960
better lacking the freedom to commit
sexual exploitation to AIO and therefore

553
00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:47.119
men like him impedes their ability to
properly manage the world and keep

554
00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:52.880
everything safe this power that was once
exclusively theirs they perceive was

555
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:59.400
stolen from them by the women who they
are already exploiting utena's role is

556
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.680
to signify a new kind of woman this
woman cannot be defeated by the

557
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.720
traditional means and therefore the
method of dealing with them is to remove

558
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.720
their power by feminizing them and
ultimately groom them to accept their

559
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.480
own exploitation and that's just what
you get from the end of the world stuff

560
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.160
which is probably one of the weirder
parts of aenna until you get to the

561
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.880
turning into cars thing but I digress
there's a lot more that aenna has to say

562
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.880
about power Truth Versus illusion
schooling adolescence

563
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.200
in conjunction with other symbols and
themes like the upside down castle and

564
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:37.079
the power of
[Music]

565
00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:43.079
Revolution this is about the
Revolutionary girl utena after all which

566
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.280
is strange because for all that the
language of revolution is dangled over

567
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.400
her head she seems to reject it power
structure itself is something all

568
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.560
versions of utena seems to discuss and
seem to come to a singular conclusion

569
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.680
that the objective of those in power is
to facilitate their control by crafting

570
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.280
the Next Generation into drones and this
is clearest in the movie The power

571
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.760
Brokers don't need to get their hands
dirty when they can just organize an

572
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.960
increasingly complicated schedule of
duels to sick the students onto each

573
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.040
other another reading of AIO outside of
Doos in the revolution is that his

574
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:20.400
surname is otori which is different from
his sister's Hima otori being the same

575
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.359
name as the academy again rather than a
singular individual he could represent a

576
00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:27.800
broader scope of authority figures in
school ring institutions this could

577
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.640
range from statutory malice to Mere
unprofessionalism I mean there is a lot

578
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.680
more to utena than AIO I'm sorry if my
focus is here at the expense of spending

579
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.119
basically no time talking about nomy oh
this can't be I was so close to becoming

580
00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:49.200
the idol of the school I can't seem to
think clearly anymore am I having

581
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:55.160
delusions do I need my appendix
removed bring me a blanket someone and

582
00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:02.160
S shut up girl needs help I'm sure that
whole ordeal is symbolic for something

583
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.880
anyway the ability of a single element
of the show to function in a myriad of

584
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.440
ways with multiple applications speaks
to the Creator's credit even if and this

585
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.079
is often the case with authors many of
these meanings were unintended an

586
00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:17.720
authorial ability to deconstruct the
world into a collection of symbols that

587
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.880
have this kind of universality showcases
a Savvy and insightful creative team

588
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:30.720
however there is something thus far
this is a show called The Revolutionary

589
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.599
girl utena what is this Revolution and
how is utena the one to be revolutionary

590
00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:39.680
if she spends most of the anime trying
to prevent others from using Revolution

591
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.200
the use of revolution in the show is
only slightly different from how we

592
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.200
would use it it's not something like the
retirement of the French aristocracy a

593
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.280
nation becoming independent from a
parent state or even say Bernie Sanders

594
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.599
attempting to impose a tax structure in
America that's similar to what existed

595
00:43:56.599 --> 00:44:02.640
in the 1960s Revolution itself in utena
seems to be an object one would use

596
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.960
revolution the same way you would use a
toaster and those who know that the

597
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.960
power of Revolution resides at otori
Academy seem to be desperate to use it

598
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.440
but even though they talk about
Revolution as if it were a power or a

599
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.880
tool the language of postmodernism opens
up a number of possibilities for what

600
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.319
use revolution serves to the characters
to the plot and to the audience when the

601
00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:28.119
characters talk about the power to
Revolution the world it means we little

602
00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:32.839
media analysts that we are don't have to
look at it as a Kamehameha blast we can

603
00:44:32.839 --> 00:44:37.200
approach it as a vaguely established and
largely undefined quality of being able

604
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.160
to bring about a significant change to
the world which helps establish the

605
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.000
deeper motivations of what each
character wants to use revolution to do

606
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.520
of course tied into this theme of
Revolution are Miracles and Eternity and

607
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.520
since I can't read or understand
Japanese I may be losing something in

608
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.240
the translation because miracle are
often associated with Christian imagery

609
00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.920
instead I think the plot is much more in
line with Alan Moore's sense of Miracles

610
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.040
a miracle is a thing that shouldn't be
possible but is in utena Miracles seem

611
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.920
to be things that afford a false sense
of hope the cynical believe this thing

612
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.119
is impossible even if it is actually
true this is the primary driving element

613
00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:20.520
of jwy who is in love with her ex bestie
and considers it an impossibility that

614
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.599
this little psycho would ever
reciprocate those feelings the hope that

615
00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:29.280
she might or that she could
is the source of jory's toxicity which

616
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.599
leads to jory's deeper motivation she
wants to eliminate miracles from the

617
00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:39.319
world she wants to use revolution to
purge herself of Hope which is a

618
00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:42.800
recurring pattern with all dualists
their intended uses for the power of

619
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.040
Revolution are self-directed yes seonji
desperately wants the long-term and

620
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.760
stable affection of a subservient woman
namely anthy but even if these

621
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.200
intentions aren't specifically malicious
a character like Mickey wants to use

622
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.160
eternity to preserve and protect an an
though only for him to use as a muse to

623
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.839
this he needs to first take control of
her whereas utena's motivations are to

624
00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:07.520
liberate anthy utena stands out because
not only does she have no use for

625
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.240
revolution she seems to reject it and
even imply that she doesn't really

626
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.319
believe in any of it her exclusive
motivation is to protect anthy from the

627
00:46:15.319 --> 00:46:19.040
predatorial intentions of the other
dualists treating the duels as symbolic

628
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.720
depicts these conflicts as indicative of
the ways young people clash as they

629
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.640
develop identity though the student
council postures itself as a itical body

630
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.280
they do amount to a collection of young
people who are very nervous about their

631
00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.280
future and questioning what role they
are going to have in the world having

632
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.920
the power to revolutionize the world
means that they can have a hand on the

633
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.440
wheel deliberate driving metaphor from
the student council's introductory

634
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.960
monologue it may seem like something a
villain would say to announce themselves

635
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:51.119
prepare for trouble make it double
however the more we begin to empathize

636
00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:54.760
with the student council the more we
begin to see this monologue as a

637
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:59.079
desperate bid to take take control of
their anxieties if it cannot break out

638
00:46:59.079 --> 00:47:04.559
of its shell the chick will die without
ever being born we are the chick the

639
00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:09.680
world is our egg if we don't crack the
world's shell we will die without truly

640
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.559
being born liutenant Echoes a particular
anxiety of growing up in Japan in the

641
00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:18.720
1990s when the nation was in one of the
worst Financial depressions in its

642
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.760
history to many it did feel like the end
of the world and discourse around

643
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.319
Revolution was not far off we'll get
more into that in an upcoming Evangelion

644
00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:31.079
video I promise and if Japanese Youth of
the 9s got it anything like Millennials

645
00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:34.800
of the late 2000s got it then it would
have seemed like the entire weight of

646
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.319
the world was imparted on their
shoulders to fix things all the while

647
00:47:39.319 --> 00:47:43.240
the powers at be insisting that fixing
things was the responsibility of the

648
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.920
nation's youth simultaneously scolded
them for talking about upsetting The

649
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.000
Establishment values that led to these
hardships in the first place especially

650
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.839
towards the end of the second Arc
discourse around growing up takes a a

651
00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:00.480
central role as a driving theme and then
suddenly we get the third season and

652
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.000
everyone is in cars and their shirts are
flying off and is Aio toga not

653
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.720
that AIO doesn't have these chaotic by
Vibes but what does a casual approach to

654
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.400
sexuality have to do with

655
00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.630
[Music]

656
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.520
cars right so as indicated in an episode
where nm's younger boyfriend desperately

657
00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.319
wants to be a grown-up so that he can
interact with women the way that he sees

658
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:29.400
older boy doing there is a single line
questioning when someone becomes an

659
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.599
adult the gang tosses around a few
things that signify the kind of

660
00:48:32.599 --> 00:48:37.119
adulthood that they have in their mind
and one of them is driving a car and

661
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:40.680
then the third Arc becomes all about
driving cars where we see AIO basically

662
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.240
grooming the student body into helping
him indoctrinate utena these scenes can

663
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.520
be read as an older man ushering high
school students into adulthood at times

664
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:53.200
before they're ready but also certainly
on his terms and not theirs akio's

665
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.440
depiction of adulthood is suave
mysterious and sexy even though his

666
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:04.240
promises seem to ring adulthood there's
an unspoken reminder that they are in

667
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.799
his car even during the duel where each
respective Pretender bride is driving

668
00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:14.520
around trying to vehicular manslaughter
Renna they are in his car they are not

669
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.640
in their own cars it's not until seonji
begins to question why toga is letting

670
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.680
himself be manipulated into being akio's
wingman that we see them in their own

671
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.200
vehicle with togga driving songji a
scene we can read as these two young men

672
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.319
breaking away from the patterns of
manipulation and oppression that have

673
00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:34.559
been established by the adults in their
lives and that isn't to say that either

674
00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:38.160
of these young men don't have a lot to
make up for but they have a better shot

675
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.240
at doing the right thing while cutting
their own path rather than being under

676
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.920
the tutelage of someone like Akio this
is doubled down on in the movie where

677
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.400
the student council members including
zongji appear at the end to help anthy

678
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:57.480
Escape so what is revolution in probably
the most post modern turn of events

679
00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.160
that's never made clear what exactly is
this power that everyone wanted to use

680
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:05.280
abuse and exploit anthy Andor women in
general to get a hold of what made all

681
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:09.640
of this worth it especially because the
power is found in a castle in the sky

682
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.640
that is described as an illusion
generated by a holographic machine but

683
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.160
described by a character who is
routinely outlined as being unreliable

684
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.240
Akio as aformentioned was unable to
access the power of Revolution and not

685
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.280
because he didn't have the power of Doos
which took from utena after he had her

686
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.799
stabbed in the back he breaks the sword
of dios and Revolution remains

687
00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:35.839
exclusively Out Of Reach This tracks
thematically because what honestly was

688
00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:39.799
Akio going to give himself with
Revolution that he didn't already have

689
00:50:39.799 --> 00:50:43.720
his entire plot to bewitch utena was
just to try and convince her to

690
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.079
relinquish Revolution to him but Dodges
the question whenever anyone asks him

691
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:52.720
what he wants to do power for power's
sake he was already doing a bang up job

692
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.559
at finding a horde of people to ship his
sister off to as the rosebride but

693
00:50:56.559 --> 00:51:00.880
somehow his greatest desire and deepest
anxiety stemmed from losing control of

694
00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:08.359
his sister especially to another man and
I can imagine the prospect of losing his

695
00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:13.480
sister to a woman is nothing short of IM
mascula is this a good place to mention

696
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.000
that corrective rape is the most common
form of sexual assault imposed on

697
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.520
lesbians asexuals and transmen and it
means exactly what it sounds like and

698
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.079
while he may Express disappointment
utena for not being able to bring

699
00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:31.599
Revolution to the world he's met with a
nasty surprise that the key to his

700
00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:36.720
martyrdom is suddenly making decisions
for herself and worse yet using that new

701
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.599
power to leave him so we the audience
can easily interpret that as a victory

702
00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:44.720
in spite of utena's apparent defeat that
yes she somehow did manage to use the

703
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:50.000
power of Revolution and she used it in
an impossible selfless way she liberated

704
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.240
her best friend from a toxic power
Dynamic she had with her family and for

705
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.760
those who know getting someone to
abandon a toxic family environment even

706
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.920
if it is emotionally and psychologically
damaging is next to Impossible many

707
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.400
people who try to separate a friend from
a toxic family end up having to abandon

708
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.480
their friendship to protect their own
mental health through a not so

709
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.160
allegorical reading we can say utena did
the same that ultimately in spite of her

710
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:18.200
bravado and nobility she had to throw in
the towel anime can show teenagers

711
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.960
saving the world from interdimensional
vampires all it once presenting a story

712
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.319
where a teenager can engage with deeply
toxic authority figures without

713
00:52:25.319 --> 00:52:30.640
deep-seated emotional scars is always
going to be more unrealistic anthy's

714
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.799
final decision to leave the school and
find utena speaks to her acknowledgement

715
00:52:34.799 --> 00:52:39.119
that she has been a participant in this
and that she wants to make things right

716
00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:42.960
this also Echoes the Final Act of
adolescence of utena where she becomes

717
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.400
the literal vehicle of anthy's Escape
rather than the figurative vehicle in

718
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.640
the anime however this is a postmodern
reading which means this isn't utena

719
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.319
anthy and AIO but a new wave of
conventional women the suffering and

720
00:52:57.319 --> 00:53:01.359
victimhood of all women and the
patriarchal values that oppress women

721
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:05.319
utena prophesies women and their
struggle to free themselves from

722
00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:09.960
victimhood and how this uphill battle
will have casualties because in this

723
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:16.200
context we can appropriately examine one
of the more elusive Concepts eternity

724
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.359
which is spoken of frequently but has
even less elaboration than Revolution

725
00:53:20.359 --> 00:53:24.599
does both eternity and Revolution are
said to exist in the upside down Castle

726
00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:28.119
you'd think that eternity and the power
of Revolution would be contradictory

727
00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:32.720
things and you'd be correct utena's
hidden driving force through the entire

728
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.640
plot is to reconnect with the prince who
gave her the signant ring it's implied

729
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.160
that the prince Akio showed her
something Eternal which she now seeks to

730
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.480
attain and Akio uses this to groom utena
into believing the Eternal thing she

731
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:52.119
seeks is a romance with her prince but
Akio was never the prince utna was

732
00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:56.559
trying to
find it was her all along the signate

733
00:53:56.559 --> 00:54:01.720
ring may have brought her closer to this
Prince however she was the prince she

734
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.640
was looking for though as more
information is revealed to aenna she

735
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:12.400
remembers that no it was not a rose
scented embrace the prince showed her he

736
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.640
showed her the witch Frozen in Time
bearing hateful swords in her body for

737
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:22.599
all of eternity and this is both
punishment and Justice this is how the

738
00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:28.880
world must be the Witch and
anthy must bear this

739
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.960
hatred utena sees this as Injustice and
her vow to become a prince is not in

740
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.720
honor of the prince who rescued her her
bravado is not due to a pep talk from a

741
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.559
handsome man her drive to become a
prince her will her determination her

742
00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:48.000
very driving motivation that she herself
does not remember is to free anony from

743
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.240
the swords of men who somehow believe
that all women are responsible for the

744
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.119
suffering of the world and that a
woman's only cont contribution in this

745
00:54:56.119 --> 00:55:01.599
world is to endure suffering for the
benefit of a

746
00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:08.480
man utena's princely Quest is not just
to rescue anthy but to rescue all the

747
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.960
damsels in distress to rescue all women
from

748
