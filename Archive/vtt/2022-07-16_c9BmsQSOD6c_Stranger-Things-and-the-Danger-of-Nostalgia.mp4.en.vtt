00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.680
nostalgia has this weird grasp on our
society

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.199
it always has really but
recently it's gotten particularly

6
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.880
prevalent movies tv shows books even
politicians have been using nostalgia to

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.399
warm our thoughts to the good old days
make the days we

8
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.879
very well may not have been alive to see
seem like this perfect world we should

9
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.280
all wish to return to one of the biggest
shows to come out of the last decade

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.000
stranger things has been attributed by
viewers and media analysts alike

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.960
as being a huge catalyst for wave of
1980s nostalgia holding on to our member

12
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.800
berries with an iron grip stranger
things is set in the fictional rural

13
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.920
town of hawkins indiana during the 1980s
the nearby hawkins national laboratory

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
performs scientific research for the
united states department of energy but

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.760
secretly does experiments into the
paranormal and supernatural including

16
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.840
those that involve human test subjects
such as the show's lead character known

17
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.520
as eleven inadvertently they have
created a portal to the hellish

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.439
alternate dimension the upside down and
the influence of the upside down starts

19
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.720
to affect the residents of hawkins in
calamitous ways the first season begins

20
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.960
in november of 1983 with the
disappearance of will byers who is

21
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.400
abducted by a creature from the upside
down that his friends name the

22
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.880
demigorgon his mother joyce and the
town's police chief jim hopper lead a

23
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.560
mostly off-the-books investigation into
his disappearance

24
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.119
meanwhile eleven who has psionic powers
escapes from the laboratory and is found

25
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.280
by will's friends with everyone working
together they eventually rescue will and

26
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.520
defeat the demigorgon but not without
some of the upside down finding its way

27
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.159
into our world the second season is set
a year later when will begins having

28
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.280
premonitions of the fall of hawkins
caused by a creature in the upside down

29
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.599
that dwarfs the demigorgon of season 1.
when it is discovered that will is

30
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.840
possessed by the entity his friends and
family make a mad attempt at rescuing

31
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.560
him once again in the process
discovering the grave dangers that lurk

32
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440
just below the surface of their small
town

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.040
season three expands the mythology as we
learn more about the creature believed

34
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.599
to be heading the forces of the upside
down the mind flare which makes its way

35
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.480
into our dimension by possessing and
destroying bodies its defeat is only a

36
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
momentary relief though as season 4
introduces us to the real big bad of the

37
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000
series vecna an evil force 11 once
fought before but has grown much more

38
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
powerful since then it takes the
combined efforts of every lead and

39
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
supporting character on the show to
fight him only to end in a loss as his

40
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.040
plan comes to fruition as the upside
down begins to invade the real world

41
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.360
completely so from this albeit brief
description of events you might be

42
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.400
asking yourself where's the nostalgia in
that

43
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.000
who wants to remember going through
possession child abduction fighting

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.400
interdimensional demons and trauma with
a topping of more trauma good question

45
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.239
it's one i've been asking myself because
while some people love reliving the

46
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.680
1980s via the show a lot of other people
have sworn off the show because of it so

47
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.080
let's make like a cnn news anchor and
look at both sides figure out what

48
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.760
exactly is nostalgia
and

49
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.159
if stranger things is in the right side
up

50
00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:49.770
or the upside down of it
[Music]

51
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.889
[Music]

52
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:24.159
[Music]

53
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.280
if we're going to talk about the
morality of nostalgia that is its moral

54
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.479
implications on our media landscape and
culture as a whole

55
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.680
we need to clearly outline what it is
but when it comes to nostalgia it's the

56
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.400
clarity part that's the problem when it
comes to words most people would agree

57
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.840
that consulting a dictionary is the
easiest way to define one the

58
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.320
merriam-webster dictionary defines
nostalgia as one a wistful or

59
00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.479
excessively sentimental yearning for
return to or of some past period or

60
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.840
irrecoverable condition
also something that evokes nostalgia

61
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.960
and two
the state of being homesick the

62
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.840
cambridge dictionary defines it as a
feeling of pleasure and also slight

63
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.479
sadness when you think about things that
happened in the past neither of those

64
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.759
definitions are inherently wrong
but dictionaries often lack two things

65
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.039
first a description of how these
definitions ought to be applied in

66
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.000
colloquial language and second an
awareness of a given society's emotional

67
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.199
associations of the word take for
instance the word ultimate according to

68
00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.759
traditional dictionary usage something
that is ultimate is the last entry in a

69
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.240
long and perhaps epic catalog the
ultimate letter of the alphabet is z but

70
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.479
in common uses it means something like
the best or the most powerful something

71
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.440
game-changing and dictionaries are often
very slow to catch up on expanding a

72
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.759
formal definition of a word to include
common uses however when it comes to

73
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.000
nostalgia we throw this word around a
lot the problem with these

74
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.880
aforementioned definitions is that they
treat nostalgia as a feeling

75
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.400
when it seems to be used to describe a
thing

76
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.039
this thing is nostalgic i would argue
that especially recently nostalgia can

77
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.280
be seen almost like a literary device
something that creators and producers

78
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.160
especially use in order to hone in on an
audience that is dissatisfied with the

79
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.280
current state of the world roughly
speaking in spite of nostalgia's focus

80
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.479
around a bittersweet recollection of the
past in most examples it's often used to

81
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.240
describe media that celebrates a
particular era in a culture's history

82
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.560
getting back to the question at hand is
stranger things nostalgia it does take

83
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.199
place in the 1980s and therefore as
historic fiction it is naturally going

84
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.199
to include aesthetics and objects from
the decade and therefore will

85
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.280
automatically remind people of the 1980s
and most people tend to have fond

86
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.680
memories of their childhood so yes it
can inspire that feeling but there is a

87
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.160
question about to what extent the series
leans on nostalgia as a reason to watch

88
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.720
his finger looking good is a glowing
rose-tinted depiction of the 80s all it

89
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.880
has to offer see back when season one
first came out i dodged it i read some

90
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.919
people saying they couldn't get through
the first season because they said it

91
00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.759
was just nostalgia bait and nothing more
it wasn't until the second season that i

92
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.880
picked up on the series and now i watch
it when it drops at 4am

93
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.400
every season in spite of whatever
nostalgia it may inspire before

94
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.360
reminding people that the 80s was her
thing

95
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.599
it's just an exceptionally well made
show on nearly every front but it wasn't

96
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.919
until i re-binged the series going into
season 4 that i really struggled to

97
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.240
figure out where to find the nostalgia
in the first chapter of this stephen

98
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.039
king esque kids on bikes supernatural
horror the show points out several

99
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.960
brands that don't exist anymore reminds
you of the role that modern brands had

100
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.639
in contributing to the cultural
atmosphere of the 1980s and the plot

101
00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.759
takes you to places that have mostly
died off when you get down to it that's

102
00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.599
really where the nostalgia is a
celebration of narrative tropes and

103
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:14.000
characters that were frequent in the
1980s specifically those commonly used

104
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.599
by stephen king the duffer brothers were
actually in discussion to spearhead

105
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:22.240
2017's remake of it but warner brothers
didn't want to hire people only known

106
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.080
for streaming shows
and now warner brothers is desperately

107
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.919
trying to get their streaming service
off the ground

108
00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:34.560
however is a reprisal of narrative
tropes alone indicative of nostalgia i

109
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.560
would struggle to justify that even per
the dictionary definition especially as

110
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.399
far as these instances were meant to
reprise these tropes and find ways to

111
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:46.560
fit them into the larger context of
cultural awareness tropes themselves are

112
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.640
not limited to a particular point in
time and when it comes to the second

113
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.440
season
there really isn't that much more in the

114
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.959
way of the feel-good rose-tinted lens we
expect of media about the 80s

115
00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:03.040
again the reverence here is a reverence
for tropes and narrative devices that

116
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.640
were popular in the day
if season 1 is a love letter to stephen

117
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.519
king and steven spielberg with the likes
of e.t

118
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.560
season two is a love letter to the
exorcist gremlins whether or not a piece

119
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.560
of historic media is out to
sentimentalize the past depends on what

120
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.720
it's trying to get you to remember and
what it's encouraging you to overlook

121
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.120
compare and contrast with ready player
one ready player one references the 80s

122
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.880
incessantly with allusions to video
games and cultural icons but does

123
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.920
absolutely nothing to depict the
cultural context from which it was

124
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.640
removed for instance ready player one
almost cluelessly makes the principal

125
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.040
villain an executive who is trying to
gain ownership of a public commodity

126
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.640
this element juxtaposed against the
positive depictions of scrappy kids

127
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.839
fighting the man and reverent treatment
of 1980s iconography establishes a

128
00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:56.000
narrative language
things from the 1980s are good we want

129
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.320
these things to save the day and be
heroic but things shown to be from our

130
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.920
modern culture that being corporate
takeovers commodification financial

131
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.279
exploitation
these are bad things

132
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.440
and the implicit messaging is
things today are bad

133
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.760
so don't you miss the 1980s when things
were good but these are things that

134
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.399
started happening in the 1980s with
reagan's campaign of deregulation the

135
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:25.360
rose tinted goggles allowed the reader
viewer to pretend they didn't pop up

136
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.839
until recently through a viewer's
emotional investment in media a producer

137
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:34.480
can associate positive feelings with the
1980s you want what the characters you

138
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.880
identify with want you want eggos and
when a producer wants you to turn away

139
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.800
from something like
secret government laboratories

140
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.880
they can associate negative feelings
when your main characters interact with

141
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.959
government agencies that's called
subliminal messaging when nostalgia is

142
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:54.880
described as toxic it's referencing
media which seeks to use this subliminal

143
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.839
process to redevelop historic realities
in this instance forming positive

144
00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.839
emotions around cultural landmarks of
the 1980s the more this process is

145
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:07.519
repeated the more the negative aspects
of 80s culture are diminished and there

146
00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:11.200
was plenty about the 1980s that was
horrible and that became more true the

147
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.560
less white the less straight the less
male and the less rich you were the

148
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.880
thing is i can't really say that
stranger things does anything to really

149
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.200
engage with this kind of nostalgic
celebration season one spends most of

150
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.120
its episodes going out of its way to
remind people why stranger danger was

151
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.880
such a big deal stranger danger while
you may have heard the phrase used

152
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.040
comedically has an incredibly dark
history back in the 80s there was a

153
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.040
massive rash of child disappearances to
the point of nearly becoming endemic

154
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.640
stranger danger was a propaganda
campaign and in this context propaganda

155
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.959
is used positively to condition children
to be wary of strangers

156
00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:50.959
even if and especially if they claim to
know your parents and tell you to get

157
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:56.160
into a car stranger things season one
revolves mostly around the disappearance

158
00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.320
of will byers and hinges on his mother
joyce played by multiple oscar nominee

159
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.040
winona ryder who thanks to this series
is finally getting her career back after

160
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.800
shoplifting god it didn't take much back
in the day anyway winona carries the

161
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.839
first season as a mother experiencing an
emotional breakdown over the

162
00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.440
disappearance of her child the first
season also dealt with severe bullying

163
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.519
to the point of knife violence double
standards regarding sexuality among boys

164
00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:23.920
and girls extreme prevalence of casual
homophobia and a complete dismissal of

165
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.959
trauma from almost literally
everyone with stranger things one as an

166
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:33.440
exclusive reference in conjunction with
will buyer's hair the 1980s is not a

167
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.040
period of time i would ever want to live
in and given that the social climate of

168
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.800
the first season is focused entirely
around bullying slut-shaming and casual

169
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.600
homophobia i'm not sure what about
season one made so many people write it

170
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.680
off as mindless nostalgic drivel season
two seemed to have even less to say

171
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.920
about the 1980s specifically aside from
featuring a local arcade as a setting

172
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.959
for a handful of scenes and an
unmentioned albeit obvious racist

173
00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:00.959
sentiment coming from a secondary
villain elements that can be considered

174
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:04.240
to be nostalgia based
i feel like in a lot of ways they're

175
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.240
just there to frame the characters as
being people who existed in the 1980s

176
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.760
the ghostbusters halloween costumes may
be a hollow reminder of the franchise's

177
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.000
origins but it's also not at all out of
the question that a group of four nerdy

178
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.040
friends would opt to make costumes out
of one of the most popular movies of the

179
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.160
year not that they need help to
establish these characters but it would

180
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.720
make less sense if they dressed up as
anything else for halloween if creators

181
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.399
go out of their way to avoid cultural
references in historic media there's a

182
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.760
point where it becomes more apparent
than if they just let their characters

183
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.440
exist in the time period where a
discussion about popular movies would

184
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.600
inevitably find its way into a
conversation season three stands out in

185
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.440
the series however whereas the prior two
seasons do very little to engage with

186
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.839
the celebration of the era season three
seems to want to dive right in without

187
00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:52.959
any prior build up in the first two
seasons the key element of the third

188
00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:59.639
season revolves around the nostalgia
of shopping malls

189
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.079
malls seem to hold a place of particular
prominence in 1980s media

190
00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:12.320
my guess is that first of all there was
a glut of shopping malls constructed in

191
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.440
the 1980s secondly they became prevalent
as teenage safe hangout zones with only

192
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.199
cursory adult supervision capitalism
says

193
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:25.839
get em young so a lot of adults today
have collected a large number of teenage

194
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.760
memories that take place in shopping
malls as they grow up and become

195
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.160
creators and audiences like all
generations they favor media which

196
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
revisits their childhood whereas the
prior seasons were referencing a rash of

197
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.079
missing children that nobody likes to
talk about as well as a mysterious virus

198
00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:46.560
beset on people who may or may not be
homosexual again that nobody really

199
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.880
likes to talk about season three
features a lot of hell yeah the mall

200
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.959
there are two overlapping shopping
montages a strong positive association

201
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.600
between teenage freedom of identity and
consumerism and a plethora of product

202
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.839
placement which feels more like a 30
rock joke wow this is diet snapple i

203
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:07.360
know it tastes like regular snapple
doesn't it but wanton references to

204
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.600
products aren't the only methods this
season has to evoke nostalgic feelings

205
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.279
all seasons stranger things feature a
number of 80 songs that have stood the

206
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:20.399
test of time with specific songs taking
the center stage as pivotal moments for

207
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:24.800
plot developments which in itself is not
altogether uncommon for other media

208
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.680
which focuses on the 1980s or any decade
for that matter and while prior seasons

209
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.639
of stranger things tried to latch onto
one or two songs season 3 kicks it up a

210
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.959
notch the show cuts from one song to the
next at a dizzying rate over the first

211
00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:43.279
half it begins to feel like a jukebox
musical like i said season 3 stands out

212
00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:47.440
in this regard and i have to wonder why
it's reported that eggo had a huge

213
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.040
business spike following season 1 so
you'd think that if there was going to

214
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.639
be a glut of product placement finding
its way into the show it would have been

215
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:59.600
in season two and there were a few more
brands openly depicted in that season

216
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.680
namely pringles and dr pepper steve
drives a bmw but it's really nothing

217
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.519
more than you'd expect from any other
television show and when a piece of

218
00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:12.959
media establishes patterns which it then
begins to change we the audience are

219
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:18.480
implored to wonder why the easy answer
is that netflix knows that this show is

220
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.519
printing money
so they want to double down and sell ad

221
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:25.839
space in the show itself things like the
michael bay transformers movies are

222
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:30.560
infamous for doing this
do you like music

223
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.199
the pill

224
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.680
which is a cynical albeit all too common
occurrence but i'm not convinced the

225
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.800
stranger things sold out like that
because if that was the case it would

226
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.399
have kept it up with season four in
which it goes back to the normal amount

227
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.959
of brand references and even then these
references aren't always the shallow

228
00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:54.160
holding the can at the right angle to
see the whole logo instances of brand

229
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.279
display that we're so used to that we
just ignore now using hey remember eggos

230
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:03.680
as an example they are significant to
the plot insofar as they're meaningful

231
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.280
to eleven whereas other characters
including other kids cie goes as

232
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.600
entirely unremarkable they are
remarkable to eleven because she has

233
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.160
never had food like this to this
remarkable young girl eggos are a symbol

234
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.079
of her freedom which if you feel like it
you can read into it as this very

235
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.280
nostalgic and downright patriotic
depiction of consumer products as

236
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.839
evident of american capitalist freedom
for which eleven's freedom to purchase

237
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.360
and consume her favorite brand of
waffles is at odds with the government

238
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.600
that wants to control her which in
itself is nostalgic for reagan-era

239
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.280
anti-government propaganda as per his
quote the

240
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.280
nine most terrifying words in the
english language are

241
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.280
i'm from the government and i'm here to
help this sentiment coming from the

242
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.200
executive branch no less established an
ideological battle between the american

243
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.960
government and american industry and if
we're presenting nostalgic tropes and

244
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.640
stranger things we must also be aware
that a massive component of american pop

245
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.280
culture from the decade conformed to
this ideological conflict touching on

246
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.600
ghostbusters again probably among the
principal pieces of 1980s corporate

247
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.360
media it was all about a group of
entrepreneurs providing a needed service

248
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.799
which the government was hell-bent on
shutting down due to ambiguous

249
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:19.440
government regulation this movie was not
at all the cause but symptomatic of a

250
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.240
successful propaganda campaign launched
by the reagan administration propaganda

251
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.440
with the intent to erode public trust
for the government in order to garnish

252
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.559
the public support needed to remove
regulations and safety checks placed

253
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:35.600
upon the economy that had existed since
the new deal regulations and safeties

254
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.120
which ensured that the great depression
would not happen again and that america

255
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.960
would have the ability to endure smaller
recessions without decimating the

256
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.440
economy but these regulations also cut
into profit and it's interesting that

257
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.440
season three the season that takes place
almost entirely in a mall is the only

258
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.960
season to engage in any kind of
political economic or ideological debate

259
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.480
about american culture within the
written text of the script so perhaps

260
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.559
what can be read as nostalgic longing is
actually a very specific point being

261
00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:07.440
made about the kind of consumerism that
sprung up in the 1980s because for all

262
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.919
the freedom the mall affords the cast of
teenagers it's not a picnic for everyone

263
00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:15.679
on a textual level small businesses
around hawkins are drying up this is a

264
00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:19.200
brief part of the story that exists more
in establishing shots and it's dropped

265
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.160
early on but on a subtextual level look
at what's going on the shopping mall a

266
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.320
temple to american capitalism was funded
and constructed by a cell of soviet

267
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.960
agents to conceal a secret base deep
underground where they could open a

268
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.200
portal to hell with the intent of moving
an army onto american soil undetected

269
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.880
furthermore the final battle takes place
in the maul against a giant flesh

270
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.400
monster constructed out of the liquefied
remains of the members of the community

271
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.400
this could alternately be read as the
heroic defense of this quintessentially

272
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.679
american capitalistic space against
soviets and flesh monsters however

273
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:57.360
keep in mind that the season does go out
of its way to talk about political

274
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.039
ideology which means that the writers
want you to think about it not even in

275
00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:05.280
the america good rush a bad kind of way
but actually diving into the mechanics

276
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.320
of these different economic systems you
know what i love most about this country

277
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.200
capitalism it means this is a free
market system which means people get

278
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.520
paid for their services depending on how
valuable their contributions are even

279
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.720
though erica is aware of the
institutional and ideological separation

280
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.320
between the political models there are
some bits of information that are being

281
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.720
omitted namely the reasoning for why
either system is greater than the other

282
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.799
if we are living in reagan's america we
have to realize that this was a period

283
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:38.640
of time when the economic philosophies
of iron rand if you could call them that

284
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.720
began to be applied on a federal level
rand left russia for the west where she

285
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.240
truly felt that capitalism was a
superior form of

286
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.400
culture her primary philosophical
contrast was that she felt that soviet

287
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.120
communism resulted in collectivism where
the population is conditioned to conform

288
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.520
into a singular ideology the people like
what the state says they like they eat

289
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.360
what the state says they act how the
state says the state commissions music

290
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.039
and film for the people to enjoy
individuality and expression is

291
00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:11.200
repressed in order for each citizen to
behave and act in accordance with what

292
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.039
the state needs the state needs a farmer
you're a farmer granted in larger urban

293
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:20.320
areas like st petersburg and moscow
there was a bit more freedom in what

294
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.760
venues you had opened to you but because
the kremlin had to govern so much

295
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.480
territory if you were born to farmers in
rural latvia it did not matter how

296
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.720
talented a musician you could be the
state needs you to be a farmer in

297
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.280
contrast to collectivism rand lauded the
west for its promotion of individualism

298
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.159
in her perfect little world where
actions have no consequences and

299
00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:43.919
ironically everyone behaves as she
expects them to capitalism affords the

300
00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:47.280
opportunities for people with radical
ideas to rise up and belly flop under

301
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.520
the free market those ideas which people
want will thrive those which people do

302
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.000
not will fade away the primary selling
point of capitalism is meritocracy where

303
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.840
there is a system of capital which
rewards diligence or innovation and this

304
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.720
process rand argues is the crux of the
individual's ability to express their

305
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.120
individual personhood
shopping malls slightly off topic but

306
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.720
not really i'm not entirely convinced
that rand wasn't a soviet sleeper agent

307
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.880
sent to america to speed up the downfall
of decadent capitalism with her own even

308
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.200
more toxic version of capitalism now her
thought process is flawed for a number

309
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.120
of reasons chiefly the naive insanity of
assuming that those who refuse to

310
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.960
innovate will simply bow their heads and
gracefully fade away from the market to

311
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.320
make way for the new innovators and that
corporations and individuals with

312
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.559
sufficient wealth will not flex their
wealth to shut down competition and for

313
00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:40.640
all rand blamed the government for
restricting glorious freedom

314
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.280
the corporatocratic oligarchy of america
influences the government to protect

315
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.200
their interests these interests include
the hidden copyright vault in general

316
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.159
electric nokia and big pharma in general
which each house the technology to throw

317
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:57.600
us into a utopic age because their
largest yearly expense is buying a

318
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.120
patented technology developed at
universities to make sure they never see

319
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.960
the light of day in order to foster the
consumer public's dependency on their

320
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.080
existing profit-driven products and
because this always comes back to disney

321
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.159
this also includes their influence over
american lawmaking to chronically extend

322
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:19.120
the date of intellectual property
ownership expiry suddenly capitalism

323
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.679
isn't a meritocracy anymore it rewards
people of wealth with more wealth and

324
00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.799
everyone else
do they get to be individuals there is a

325
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:31.120
possible reading of season three that
discusses this examine hawkins almost

326
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.200
everybody who isn't in the main cast
each season depicts a clear through line

327
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.880
of groupthink you are to like what
society expects you to like you are to

328
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.240
eat what you are expected to eat you are
within an established expectation of

329
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.919
behavior you are expected to listen to a
certain kind of music and you face

330
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:49.679
public ridicule if you do not conform as
closely as possible the government

331
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.840
doesn't

332
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.440
it was how to convince a population to
enjoy something they may not otherwise

333
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.559
enjoy tip if you present your product as
if everyone already likes it people will

334
00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:15.360
decide that they want to like it because
they want to like what everybody else

335
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.760
likes and suddenly popularity and being
liked by others boils down to a matter

336
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.159
of who can exemplify the most archetypal
version of american that a given

337
00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:28.640
population has decided upon thanks
mccarthyism and this has social feedback

338
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.159
as well skip ahead to season four where
hawkins goes on a vigilante spree

339
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:35.440
against a dungeons and dragons group
you're not supposed to like nerd things

340
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.360
you're supposed to like basketball
so if you like dungeons and dragons

341
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.120
there must be something wrong with you
something delinquent

342
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.039
and if there's one delinquent thing
about you then it's not a stretch to say

343
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:51.520
that you are a ritualistic demon
worshiper funny thing is this actually

344
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.600
happened there really was a widespread
component of the satanic panic which

345
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.360
zeroed in on dungeons and dragons but
also bled over into the 1990s with

346
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.720
things like magic the gathering and
maybe not specifically tied to d and d

347
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.159
but there were public vigilante mobs
that targeted people who were accused of

348
00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:09.440
living outside christian normativity
just look at the story of the san

349
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.840
antonio iv but back to season three you
have a giant flesh monster made up of

350
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.559
good capitalist toms and jains attacking
our heroic group of weirdos a capitalist

351
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:22.880
collective trying to murder a bunch of
social outcasts the statement here is

352
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.039
that this american freedom brought about
by capitalism doesn't really exist

353
00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:30.880
all consumers are just part of the same
flesh monster at the end of the day

354
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.320
where they continue to consume but now
they consume you but the problem with

355
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.360
season three is that while this
discourse is going on we get sucked into

356
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.440
situations where the plot is stopped to
remember something from the 1980s

357
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.120
and it's also worth mentioning that the
day was saved in part due to dangerously

358
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.279
unregulated fireworks crafted into
improvised explosives there's a reason

359
00:25:55.279 --> 00:26:01.200
this warning label says 18 or older this
sucker is filled with 150 grains of

360
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.919
black powder aka gunpowder
play this you ugly piece of [ __ ]

361
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.799
which establishes two conflicting
languages one which subverts nostalgia

362
00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:18.720
and one which promotes it so i question
whether the subversion was the intended

363
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.799
reading or just an incidental inclusion
as a result of half the season needing

364
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:26.320
to take place in a shopping mall
confusing and inconsistent literary

365
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.320
language makes for messy analysis and i
feel like because season three contains

366
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.919
so much nostalgic content leaning in one
direction or the other could

367
00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:38.320
definitively answer whether the series
as a whole is using nostalgia as a

368
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.320
selling point or whether it's subverting
it but once again we're at a troubled

369
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.600
spot a definition or description of the
uses of nostalgia is not very helpful

370
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.039
for telling us how to identify it

371
00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:07.039
the tricky thing about nostalgia
is that sometimes media just takes place

372
00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:11.360
in a bygone era historic fiction another
thing is that younger generations who

373
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.960
never lived in the 1980s say can be
found reminiscing about the decade for

374
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.440
the sake of aesthetics community values
and longing to be part of a specific

375
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.440
social movement that lived and died
before the clinton administration the

376
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.080
latter case is problematic because
people in these instances often overlook

377
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.480
the unflattering components of the past
cue a bunch of gay people my age and

378
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.320
younger who wish they'd been born in new
york or san francisco a few decades ago

379
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.640
so that they could have been a part of
proper gay society without acknowledging

380
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.399
the terror the queer people lived under
every day and the reason this culture

381
00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:48.399
was so vibrant was because we
desperately needed counter programming

382
00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:52.080
to the gloom
of everyday existence and so it's not

383
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.960
always the 80s for some it's the 70s
with disco and experimental rock for

384
00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.200
others it's the 60s with soul and
woodstock my question being how can

385
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.720
nostalgia be used to describe these
feelings of people my age if a

386
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.720
definition of nostalgia requires
memories or lived experiences another

387
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.720
question is
when

388
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.640
is nostalgia intended for take a book
like the great gatsby by f scott

389
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.880
fitzgerald these days it's held up as a
token of literary canon and taught in

390
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.360
many high schools to frame a discourse
around the 1920s and modernism in prose

391
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.039
literature at the time it was considered
to be a failure next to fitzgerald's

392
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:31.840
other successful novels and was largely
ignored however it was rediscovered

393
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.600
after the second world war and held up
as a relic that described the cultural

394
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.679
mindset of the roaring 20s at its peak
even though it was intendedly written

395
00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:44.480
for a 1920s audience could we say that
this is nostalgic media

396
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.360
because it offered a sense of nostalgia
to an audience in the 1950s it's

397
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.799
difficult to find media that's
celebratory of the day and age that it's

398
00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:58.720
made in creators as per their nature are
often critical of social conventions and

399
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.120
use fiction as a way to highlight these
frustrations can we say then that

400
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:08.159
nostalgia as creators may use it to
depict the past is used to contextualize

401
00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:13.200
criticisms they have about contemporary
society but again is there a clear line

402
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.720
between nostalgia and historical fiction
can you have one without the other

403
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.960
you could even say that something like
the medieval fantasy or even dungeons

404
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.520
and dragons itself is nostalgic because
the dungeon master doesn't make a point

405
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.640
of killing off half of the sidecast from
dysentery which honestly is probably why

406
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.159
things like game of thrones typically
focus around the wealthier classes who

407
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:40.799
had the privilege to afford things like
medicine and basic hygiene but it does

408
00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:45.200
contribute to a concept of nostalgia in
which the inconvenient embarrassing or

409
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.120
harmful elements of the past are
forgotten in exchange for the ability to

410
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.200
frame a particular story in an aesthetic
setting the end result of nostalgic

411
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.120
fiction seems to be the argument wasn't
this time in history kind of great

412
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.200
wouldn't you want to be alive then for
me personally not a day before

413
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.799
penicillin and air conditioning but
where is the line drawn in general and

414
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:08.559
how do we identify this kind of
nostalgia well

415
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:12.720
it's probably best to go over some
examples we've already touched on ready

416
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.200
player one and the consequences of the
framing devices it uses to moralize

417
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.240
contemporary culture versus those of the
past

418
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.130
but it's far from being the only one of
its kind

419
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.679
[Music]
downton abbey is one of the most

420
00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:31.520
successful english shows of all time
appealing to audiences of all stripes by

421
00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.039
using the centuries-old upstairs
downstairs dynamic of telling stories of

422
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:39.120
the rich and the poor's who support them
again with the emotional support boards

423
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.080
you can watch the show in french german
korean russian persian and it had an

424
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.919
estimated global audience of 160 million
viewers at its peak in 2014 yet downton

425
00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:54.159
abbey is just the newest in a long line
of conservative propaganda that gets

426
00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:57.919
lapped up by audiences yearning for the
good old days of yore from merchant

427
00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:01.679
ivory films to notting hill much of
england's media exports have been

428
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:05.679
reinforcing old world class stereotypes
that we modern people seem to love for

429
00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:09.919
some reason doubting is a world where
rules matter how you dress for a meal

430
00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:13.200
which spoon you use the right time to
visit a new neighbor

431
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.000
the life of downton's characters
is a choreographed dance punctuated by

432
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.080
seasonal celebrations daily and weekly
rituals and celebrating a lifestyle that

433
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.919
has been regulated by the same chain of
tradition rules and expectations

434
00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:31.039
for centuries the sanctity of the
country house as ordered harmonious and

435
00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:35.360
class bound was never really challenged
and the audience cheered when the

436
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.880
various selfish and evil characters
usually amongst the poors were sent on

437
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.159
their way by nice loyal poor's who knew
their place whilst the series did toy

438
00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:49.760
with things like irish politics the
suffragette movement homosexuality and

439
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.240
middle class identity it shied away from
any real critique of english society at

440
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.720
the time heritage television like this
is regularly criticized for engendering

441
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.840
nostalgia about an idealized past in a
classic critique the film scholar andrew

442
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.640
higson suggested that such work serve to
present a conservative englishness that

443
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.440
never really existed it is inarguable
that downton abbey presents a kind of

444
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.960
lovingly rendered unquestioned version
of the past in the first down movie lady

445
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.799
mary crowley a key member of the family
was wondering whether the time had come

446
00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:26.960
to sell the grand british estate home to
a handful of aristocrats in their army

447
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.159
of servants maybe the family should move
to a more reasonably sized large manner

448
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:36.320
and turn downton into something useful
like a school but her maid

449
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.720
begged her to keep downton in the family
forever a symbol of glory and honor for

450
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.080
the staff and surrounding town don't you
see

451
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.320
all the poor people ever really wanted
was more aristocracy the show and the

452
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.080
movies that have followed have always
taken a romantic view of the old

453
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.559
economic hierarchy we're supposed to be
moving past yes this is a period piece

454
00:32:56.559 --> 00:33:01.840
written by julian fellowes the most
periody of british period writers he's

455
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.159
also a conservative member of the house
of lords and yet so much of actual 1920s

456
00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:09.679
history goes unseen at the time the
british labor movement was gaining

457
00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:13.360
traction while british newspapers were
breathlessly covering the social lives

458
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.840
of the aristocracy some people were
pushing for the abolition of hereditary

459
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.600
titles and demanding that noble's land
be taxed in 1928 working-class women

460
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.440
would get the right to vote within 20
years the entire system would fall apart

461
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.039
and domestic service would go from being
one of britain's largest sectors of

462
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:35.279
employment for women
to being virtually non-existent few

463
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.880
working-class tears were shed for the
end of that era but if you've done

464
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.159
little research into this history and
only know it the way julian fellowes

465
00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:45.679
wants you to know it
you wouldn't know that in fact you'd

466
00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:49.120
think it was damn near the downfall of
england as a whole and that even the

467
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.159
poorest of the poor were heartbroken to
see the ultra rich losing some of their

468
00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:58.960
titles and land so why do so many of us
watch this show with a romantic feeling

469
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.840
in our hearts the servants have been
stuck downstairs long enough yeah

470
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.560
it's time we go upstairs
wait what do you mean i'm talking about

471
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.879
a revolt i'm talking about a worker
uprising

472
00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:16.800
others among us myself included layer
aspiration with resentment

473
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.960
on fictional shows like hbo's succession
about a family that owns a global media

474
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.200
empire luxury porn goes down with a
chaser of self-satisfaction those grand

475
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.919
summer homes and helicopter rides are
symbols of moral decay in real life we

476
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:33.839
lap up the college admissions scandal
and the nouveau riche ostentatiousness

477
00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:37.919
of real housewives taking satisfaction
when the rich people's self-serving

478
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:42.000
tackiness catches up with them and we
know that the wait staff is watching

479
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.359
with clear eyes and the power to topple
the system from within like the

480
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:50.560
bartender whose secret 47 video helped
to doom mitt romney's 2012 run for

481
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.560
president in downton abbey there's no
threats like that the worst case

482
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.320
scenario is a valet spill some soup and
there's a stability in that kind of

483
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.320
thing that makes us nostalgic for a time
when one small mistake one missed

484
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.480
payment one forgotten appointment
wouldn't lead to you being homeless or

485
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.960
without a doctor but the nostalgia
portrayed in downton is a fantasy

486
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.480
there's this portrayal of a kinder set
of relationships between people of

487
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.640
different economic classes the servant
characters in downton like the dressing

488
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.520
lady mary feel a bond to their masters
that isn't just economic but emotional

489
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.280
and the aristocrats feel an obligation
to their servant's welfare and

490
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.720
appreciation for even the dressing and
polishing skills that they bring to the

491
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.440
table priya sasha a stanford university
history professor said of this we're

492
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.079
wise enough to know that this is a
romantic very idealized depiction of

493
00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:44.800
servant and master relations but we just
find it so attractive

494
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.160
if we're going to have inequality can it
at least be nice

495
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.200
can the dignity of every kind of work be
acknowledged this is it's true the

496
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.880
difference between downton style
inequality and the transactional

497
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.560
relationships of today's economy gone
are the days of benevolent corporate

498
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.960
paternalism a social compact that ranged
from pension funds to full-on company

499
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.920
towns now pensions are outsourced to
401ks healthcare costs are passed on to

500
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.839
the employees and within the confines of
the gig economy employer-employee

501
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:18.160
relationships don't exist at all so
nostalgia for those good old days can

502
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.000
creep into our mind while watching the
show even though those good old days

503
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.440
never really existed
the poor is lucky enough to land jobs

504
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.960
with the riches who didn't treat them
like crap were almost always white

505
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.040
christian straight cisgender and spoke
english as a first language everyone

506
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.520
else could die in a hole and often did
and for those who did have work there

507
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.040
wasn't a whole lot of camaraderie and
love for the upper classes

508
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.680
it was a business arrangement where both
parties resented the other for their

509
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.440
existence there's a reason the servants
were in the basement or in another house

510
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.280
altogether and no amount of bbc programs
where the rich and poor celebrated

511
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.160
christmas together will ever change that
yes

512
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.200
it was likely true that some of the
staff would become attached to their

513
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.200
patrons usually those who worked closer
to the patrons and whose

514
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.720
responsibilities weren't so
degrading

515
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.320
also the ones who would be paid
considerably more i can also see it

516
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.280
being a trend among rich people the ones
educated enough to write logs to be kept

517
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.200
for historic record
for them to imagine having been much

518
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.800
kinder to their servants than the
servants may have felt laughing at your

519
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.200
boss's bad jokes is a great way to get a
raise or promotion after all i've seen

520
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.040
modern media where rich ladies will
start to see their hispanic housekeeper

521
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.560
as their real friends
and i've seen people on twitter report

522
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.480
how bonkers weird it is to be on the
receiving end of those affections the

523
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.560
servants in downton abbey were employees
not family

524
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.240
the poor's survival depended on them
being able to navigate the nuances of

525
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.119
that relationship
the more they started to think of them

526
00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:52.720
like family the more cutthroat things
would get in the kitchens and it's very

527
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.079
telling i think
that the story of downton abbey at least

528
00:37:56.079 --> 00:38:00.320
as of now ends in 1928.
the year before the lords and

529
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.920
capitalists of the day destroyed the
global economy but no one really has

530
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.760
nostalgic yearnings for the great
depression so i doubt we'll be seeing

531
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.680
lord julian fellowes
tackling that anytime soon

532
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.000
greece is a 1978 film adaptation of the
1971 musical of the same name taking

533
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.160
place in the autumn semester of high
school in 1958 this film itself is

534
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.000
indicative of a nostalgic longing for
that decade which would define the

535
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.800
cultural sensibilities of the 1950s
greece features an archetypal plotline

536
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.240
of a girl and a boy in high school the
boy is afraid to be sensitive with the

537
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.720
girl because he faces social ridicule
for being a boy with feelings and the

538
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.880
girl struggles to find a way to
convince him to open up to her the

539
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.079
resolution of this boy and girl
heterosexual dilemma is that the girl

540
00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:51.760
decides she's going to completely shift
her aesthetic to be a living pinup

541
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.560
poster
and while she rocks the look it's a

542
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.560
terrible message to send to girls
wondering why boys are jerks no dangling

543
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.320
cleavage on a string like a carrot from
a fishing pole in front of a horse will

544
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.599
not get him to shape up greece's main
appeal is the entire environment of

545
00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:11.680
presenting the 1950s having spoken to
older people about this movie they claim

546
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.320
it is very accurate to capturing the
social environment of the day and age

547
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.320
rumor mills drive-ins milkshake diners
boys with their cars and broken hearts

548
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.160
at high school dances and outside of
redeeming girls who are unashamed of not

549
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.760
being like the other girls in school
like rizzo there isn't really that much

550
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.119
in greece that offers a social
commentary greece kind of functions like

551
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:36.720
this museum exhibit a recreation of a
dilapidated temple of eisenhower era

552
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.040
america and as this is eisenhower's
america a discussion about the

553
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.240
desegregation of schools is never
mentioned there are no black or asian

554
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.079
characters of note there is nerium
mention of homophobia severe bullying

555
00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:52.160
nor any other kind of social problems
which plagued the 1950s as per the

556
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.079
depiction in greece the 50s seemed like
an absolute bestest ever time to be

557
00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.280
alive the positive elements of the
decade are removed entirely from the

558
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.319
cultural reality of the era and what we
have is this dreamlike 50s fantasy where

559
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:08.000
everyone is having a great time 16 year
olds can have amazing cars smoking

560
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.240
doesn't cause cancer and pregnancy was
the worst possible outcome from sex and

561
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.280
you may say but james can't you just let
people like happy things to which i say

562
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.800
i really like greece i performed songs
from greece at talent shows for three

563
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.400
years straight in elementary school
nearly every song is an absolute banger

564
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.480
and even the side characters have stuff
to do namely the girls but i digress the

565
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.960
problem with media like this is when i
ask

566
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:36.000
what's a piece of media about the 50s
you think of greece or other media like

567
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.880
greece whereas media set in the 50s that
points out how it wasn't a party for

568
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.200
everybody often gets pushed to the
wayside i don't have a problem with fun

569
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.400
whimsical media about the past
especially if like greece the framing

570
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.839
devices of the film highlight that this
is a very dreamlike and fantastical

571
00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:55.520
depiction of the subject matter the
problem becomes when a given public

572
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.960
actively ignores and forgets media which
depicts a given time period a little

573
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.880
more earnestly and that's not to say
that you can't have a dreamlike

574
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.839
whimsical musical media that doesn't
incorporate systemic social issues john

575
00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:12.480
waters hair spray is a gay old time
dripping in nostalgic love for the 1960s

576
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.319
and yet it also contains woven into the
plot itself reminders of the systemic

577
00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:20.079
social issues that were still prevalent
in the 60s and today which to the

578
00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:24.319
advantage of the musical film genre you
can trick people into absorbing social

579
00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:29.680
commentary a whole lot easier if the
songs are catchy

580
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.319
most people never knew that the sound of
music one of the most famous and

581
00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:39.760
well-regarded musicals of all time
is actually about resisting nazis but

582
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.680
that's because they didn't know the
movie kept going after maria gets

583
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.640
married to georg von trapp and how it's
exclusively about the family fighting

584
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.280
nazis with music and passive resistance
because it was released on two vhs's and

585
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.040
we pretend take two didn't exist fun
fact if you are a commanding officer in

586
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.079
a military where you are being
encouraged to commit war crimes you can

587
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:03.920
actually leave your country that's an
option and it is ethical there really

588
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.319
isn't a just following order's argument
that turns out well for the person using

589
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:12.000
it the sound of music follows the
musical journey of maria a young woman

590
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.480
studying to be a nun unfortunately she's
got her head in the clouds and not in

591
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.680
the kind of way the catholics appreciate
with the intent of giving her something

592
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.280
productive to do the convent sends her
to the von trapp estate to be the

593
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.359
governess of a retired naval officer's
seven children the children reeling from

594
00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:30.720
the house being run like a navy vessel
since the death of their mother struggle

595
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.640
to open up to maria but through the
sound of music

596
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.079
she wins them over and eventually their
father keep in mind this is actually a

597
00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:44.079
true story however as georg von trapp is
a renowned austrian officer and a baron

598
00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:48.160
the rising nazi party desperate for
military legitimacy commands him to

599
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.599
return to his post
georg does not at all like the idea of

600
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:54.720
the nazi party and loads how the
austrian government handed itself over

601
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.560
to hitler he and maria agreed to flee
the country by traversing the alps and

602
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.880
relocate to america where they have more
children and become a sensationally

603
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:07.280
famous family choir now when it comes to
the musical a lot of the nazi stuff is

604
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.720
kept on the periphery it's really only
brought up early on through the eldest

605
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.319
daughter louisa and her teenage love
interest rolf because of course they

606
00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:18.240
named the pretty boy nazirolf i was born
in dusseldorf and that is why they call

607
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.680
me rolf so with the nazi stuff in the
background a lot of the sound of music

608
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.839
is about a callback to when life was
good and simple living in an era like

609
00:43:25.839 --> 00:43:30.079
the weimar republic the natural historic
beauty of an austrian city that had not

610
00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:33.760
been decimated by the first world war
and when family values fought against

611
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.119
rigid conformity and if you stop
watching the sound of music at the

612
00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:40.400
wedding
this is the nostalgia you get it's not

613
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.680
until george gets back from his
honeymoon and rips down the swastika

614
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.000
that's hanging over his manor that you
start to clue in oh [ __ ] and they really

615
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.960
filmed a portion of this movie in the
square where nazis held book burnings in

616
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.599
salzburg but as were the chronology of
the film maria would have no idea that

617
00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:58.400
these things would take place while
she's singing about the confidence she

618
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.760
needs to muster which is considered to
be one of the better songs in the movie

619
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.440
but was not actually in the original
stage version some gay theater trivia

620
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.319
for you the fact that so many people
report that as soon as the von trapp

621
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:11.200
wedding happened their parents hit the
pause button on the vcr and quickly

622
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.520
ushered their kids to bed is a perfect
example of how various media frames

623
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.560
nostalgia the abridged sound of music
tells the story of freedom and love

624
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.160
overcoming rigid social expectations
it's about the power of song and

625
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.040
expression having the ability to erode
and overcome grief sorry

626
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.480
tearing up a little at that and that
alone is a very positive glowing

627
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.000
depiction of social values as they
existed moving out of the classical

628
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.839
values of europe from the 1800s
embracing a more liberated social

629
00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:43.200
climate that can be found in the turn of
the century and especially into the

630
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.599
1920s and without the social framing of
hey the nazis are coming we don't really

631
00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:51.599
realize that this cultural mindset was
juxtaposed against a very different

632
00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:54.880
social climate that existed in europe at
this very same time which is an

633
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.680
important part about nostalgia and media
oftentimes it removes cultural reality

634
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.760
in lieu of feel-good fantasies playing
off of memories of the good old days we

635
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.319
take negativity for granted and as we
get older and bitter we see negativity

636
00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:11.359
mounting
pessimism is present but if we hate

637
00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:15.599
where we are today we tend to look back
for a frame of reference for when times

638
00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:21.359
were better and if we cannot find one
we will usually reinvent our past to

639
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:25.280
become the utopia we want
and so we look on the good times we had

640
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.480
learning how to sing and play guitar
from our nanny and we reject the

641
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.800
memories of fleeing from the hugo boss
germans with guns which i would like to

642
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.640
point out how difficult it would be to
make the sound of music today and how

643
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.560
people would be asking
why are musicals all of a sudden so

644
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.200
political when resisting nazis was never
really considered political beyond being

645
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.599
a for granted civic duty until recently
remember when republicans flocked to

646
00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:53.040
glenn beck because he accused every
democrat of being hitler and given

647
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.560
studio's reluctance to really lean
politically in any direction including a

648
00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.000
direction that involves telling kids
it's okay to punch nazis if sound of

649
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.599
music was being made today it would
likely entirely omit the nazis

650
00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:07.040
altogether and instead feature the von
trapp family traveling to america to

651
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:11.839
pursue fame and fortune like abba or
something and be no more than two hours

652
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:14.720
long which is another problem with
nostalgia it seeks to remove the

653
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.640
political reality from a cultural
climate and this is the problem with

654
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.240
people complaining about star wars or
ghostbusters or whatever as suddenly

655
00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.960
being political where it wasn't before
telling yourself that certain media is

656
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.720
suddenly political
when it was not is

657
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.599
yep
an element of nostalgia

658
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.240
upon examination there comes a time in
every 30-year cycle where the

659
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.359
intellectuals of a generation begin to
critically think about the droves of

660
00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:49.280
feel-good reprisals they who were also
alive in these nostalgic times are

661
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.640
willing to recall things with a bit more
honesty and yes that may mean the film

662
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.319
is a bit off-putting to right-wingers
but for this group of creators what they

663
00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:04.480
have to say is more important than
saying anything for a buck

664
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.760
i know what you're thinking what's this
doing here damn it there's gonna be a

665
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.880
whole generation of you who have never
even heard of this movie okay so austin

666
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.359
powers was a comedic movie that was a
spoof of james bond the 90s and 2000s

667
00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:22.880
were popular for this kind of comedy
taking an existing plot format the spy

668
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.119
thriller and making a farce out of it in
this case focusing on the suave sexy

669
00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:31.280
super spy austin powers is cryogenically
frozen so that he can be youthful and at

670
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.720
the top of his game pending the return
of his rival dr evil a large section of

671
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.240
the comedy in this movie is derived from
the very large gap in sex appeal as it

672
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.800
existed in the 1960s and sex appeal as
it existed in the 1990s and though he

673
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.640
was at the peak of sexuality in the 60s
austin does not adapt to fit 90

674
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.160
sensibilities very well this movie
itself is a commentary on the 30 year

675
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.960
cycle that hit the 90s with a wave of
groovy psychedelic 60s nostalgia however

676
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.440
everything that is pulled from the 1960s
feels out of place and uncomfortable and

677
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.520
at odds with 90s cultural sensibilities
and for all the culture of the 1990s

678
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.000
nostalgized the 60s the film highlighted
many elements where certain parts of the

679
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.280
60s were left behind namely social
liberties i could make a case for

680
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.200
arguing that perhaps the movie is
mocking the 90s for wanting that 60s

681
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.720
aesthetic while holding on to that
post-reagan social and fiscal

682
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.960
conservatism the 60s after all existed
in a pre-aids world of what we describe

683
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.200
as free love as in
you give your love

684
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.839
freely she's the village bicycle
everyone's had a ride

685
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:35.359
coinciding with the sexual revolution
that would continue ramping up through

686
00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:39.920
the 70s and
would come to a halt when aids began to

687
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.280
spread through a population that had
abandoned condoms for birth control

688
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.280
medication austin powers the movie is
also not shy to be critical of people of

689
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.440
the 60s either for establishing these
practices without foresight enough to

690
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.760
anticipate a
venereal fallout but as long as people

691
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.880
are still having promiscuous sex with
many anonymous partners without

692
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.599
protection well at the same time
experimenting with mind-expanding drugs

693
00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:08.480
in a consequence-free environment i'll
be sound as it found of course true to

694
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.119
those 1960 sensibilities this is a
comedy movie designed for audiences who

695
00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:17.760
take to herbal inebriation so as much as
i feel these readings are there i think

696
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.520
the primary objective here is simply to
present highly structured absurdity that

697
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.680
said the movie does take the time to
point out that a fixation on a decade 30

698
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.800
years prior is a little absurd in itself
there is a certain selective memory when

699
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.240
it comes to even venerating a single
subculture of a given decade for

700
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.240
everyone building their identity around
a watered-down 1960s aesthetic mike

701
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.280
myers says hold my mint julep and shows
up with frills square glasses and a bowl

702
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.440
cut suffice to say given the success of
this movie and the sequel there's a

703
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.800
strong case to say that subverting
nostalgic sentiments of the day and age

704
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.319
is also part of the cultural mindset
granted austin powers too premiered in

705
00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:57.839
1999 and by the time the franchise got a
third installment they had to bump it up

706
00:49:57.839 --> 00:50:02.800
to the 1970s presumably because the 60s
got stale and

707
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.280
beyonce perhaps by this time a nostalgic
subversion of the 60s had worn out and

708
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.440
you couldn't really make a mockery of it
more than had already been done which

709
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.520
suggests to me that the point at which
nostalgic tropes become a mockery is an

710
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.000
indication that we are as a culture
coming to terms with the problems of the

711
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.960
era we had spent the prior 10 years
longing for

712
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.760
hi georgie the 2017 adaptation of
stephen king's it captures what so many

713
00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.880
modern 80s set or 80s influenced horror
films rarely achieve it doesn't just

714
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.599
attempt to recreate the 80s through
clever pop culture references instead it

715
00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:44.559
brings back the genuine wonder that our
grasping nostalgic quests often seek

716
00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:48.240
while at the same time reminding us that
horror is more than recognizable

717
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.480
aesthetics it's facing the temporary
nature of time and innocence like a

718
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.040
balloon these moments are fleeting
destined to lose air or as pennywise

719
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.440
would say

720
00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.559
it was a success because the film takes
place in the 1980s instead of its

721
00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:08.640
original novel timeline in which the
kids section takes place in the 1950s it

722
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.160
was successful because it takes place in
the 80s where kids recognize that the

723
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.520
worst horrors of the world aren't
mummies werewolves or clowns but a world

724
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.160
where adults have left them their own
worst failings as an inheritance it taps

725
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.040
into one of modern society's greatest
fears

726
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.119
the endangerment of children but unlike
most nostalgic stories that look back at

727
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:31.280
bygone eras and gloss over the negatives
of the time especially for children it

728
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.559
focuses on them the real horrors of
childhood like fear of the unknown

729
00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:37.680
violent bullying abusive parents and for
many of us feeling like a complete

730
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.839
outcast it doesn't use a metaphor to
show us the horrors of growing up

731
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:46.480
instead shows us the true horrors
plainly alongside the demonic pennywise

732
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.800
there's a nostalgia within the film that
is rarely used the nostalgia of being

733
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.720
afraid this idea traces all the way back
to some of the earliest stories told to

734
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.640
children fairy tales and nursery rhymes
witches in the woods waiting to devour

735
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.839
lost children predatory wolves
pretending to be someone you can trust

736
00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:05.440
in order to take you away forever
something terribly prescient in 1980s

737
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.520
america when stranger danger was such a
prevalent fear georgie

738
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.480
meet pennywise

739
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.800
now we aren't strangers the 80 saw a
rash of child disappearances across the

740
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.800
country which the 2017 version of it
plays into unlike the book in which

741
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.960
unsolved murders are taking place the
film roots us firmly in the real world

742
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.160
by making the threat into children
vanishing without a trace and then

743
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.160
reinforces the stranger danger by making
every adult in the little town of derry

744
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.400
maine come across as a toxic force
terrifying in their own right they're

745
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.480
not monsters or pennywise in disguise
they're just grown-ups but little was

746
00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.040
more terrifying than a non-parental
grown-up in the time of stranger danger

747
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.640
this time period during which stephen
king originally wrote the doorstop size

748
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.079
novel was rife with nostalgia for the
1950s a movement spearheaded by ronald

749
00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:58.079
reagan who won both his presidential
terms on the promise of restoring

750
00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:03.520
america to the glory it had displayed
during those post-war years but as the

751
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.960
character of mike hanlon says in the
book we lie best when we lie to

752
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.839
ourselves
and lying to ourselves is what we do

753
00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:13.680
when we engage in nostalgia not only
does it devote ample narrative to

754
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.200
illustrating how the past is not as
perfect as many choose to believe but

755
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.640
forgetting and sugarcoating the past is
what allows most of the bad things in

756
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.280
this story to happen if nostalgia is our
tendency to remember and long for a past

757
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:30.160
that never quite existed the nostalgia
could be said to protect it in it

758
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.599
children see things for what they really
are but when they get older when they

759
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:38.000
find power and privilege they forget
what life was like and do not see as

760
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.559
clearly as they used to the tendency of
those with power to forget or refuse to

761
00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:46.640
believe is what allows natural and
supernatural horrors to occur it is

762
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.520
relevant that much of the horror in it
is perpetuated by human beings rather

763
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.839
than the titular interdimensional
monster it is a story full of bullying

764
00:53:55.839 --> 00:54:00.079
domestic violence and hate crimes
against minorities while king is telling

765
00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:03.280
a story about a monster that is
protected by people's desire to

766
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.680
misremember the past he is also telling
a parallel story about history and the

767
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.040
conditions that allow the more terrible
moments in human history to repeat

768
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.839
themselves through its cycles of feeding
and dormancy king almost anticipates

769
00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:19.599
this nostalgic view of history as a
cycle itself and it makes the message

770
00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:24.319
relevant all over again as yet another
u.s president donald trump won favor

771
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:28.480
through selling a false version of the
country's history and formed a tribe out

772
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:33.520
of believers in that false past it is
about a supernatural horror but also

773
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.880
about the human habits that allow
natural horrors to happen

774
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.960
it also suggests the remedy
looking at the past with clarity

775
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.440
becoming aware of how privilege and
power alter perceptions of the past it

776
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.839
lends itself to examination through the
lens of nostalgia because it is a novel

777
00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:54.240
literally about returning home though
not the safe and better home visited

778
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.160
through memories but instead a
terrifying and dangerous home the losers

779
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.119
club's lives depend on seeing what the
town at large prefers to forget one

780
00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:09.359
could argue that pennywise itself
is nostalgia every 27 years it returns

781
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:13.520
it comes back into our world with a
great act of violence and then leaves a

782
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:17.440
little while later with more blood
spilled only to sleep for 27 years and

783
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.000
then repeat the process mirroring the
30-year cycle of nostalgia it reflects a

784
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
societal habit of going through these
cycles and of forgetting the horrors

785
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.680
when they're not happening even though
the threat persists in the real world

786
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.119
but just as stan refused to be charmed
by the pleasant sounds and smells of the

787
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:37.040
circus it serves as a warning that we
allow privilege to distort our

788
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.040
perception of the past at our own peril
we let the horrors repeat

789
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.680
because we'd prefer to forget they ever
happened in the first place

790
00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:50.160
i'm gonna do something a little
different and talk about a book so

791
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.079
excuse the lack of b-roll my best
friend's exorcism was written by grady

792
00:55:54.079 --> 00:55:58.480
hendricks in 2016 and is actually set
for a film adaptation from amazon prime

793
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.839
it follows the story of abby in her
sophomore year as her best friend

794
00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:06.079
gretchen goes missing briefly and when
she is found

795
00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:10.799
she isn't quite the same abby lives a
relatively normal life until then at

796
00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:15.200
least as far as she describes it holding
down a number of friends but gretchen is

797
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:20.559
the only truly close friend she has and
it may even read a little sapphic the

798
00:56:20.559 --> 00:56:24.319
story is a retrospective look at the
culture of the late 1980s for all that

799
00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:28.000
high school students would actively
engage in pop culture there are abundant

800
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.079
references to the go-gos to madonna to
80s heartthrobs and all those other warm

801
00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:36.480
fuzzy things that are worth remembering
however hendricks uses this to lull the

802
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:41.040
reader into a rosy acceptance of 1980s
culture you know me i love a good

803
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.119
demonic possession a close friend or
relative wreaking havoc upon a community

804
00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:47.680
but
my best friend's exorcism does it a

805
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.720
little differently yes there are
supernatural elements that clearly

806
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:55.839
facilitate that gretchen is in fact
possessed by the demon andross one of

807
00:56:55.839 --> 00:57:00.559
the demons listed in the goaesha a grand
marquis of hell demonologist colin de

808
00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:04.400
plancia writes of him he appears to have
the body of an angel and the head of a

809
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:10.559
wood owl and to be riding a black wolf
and carrying in his hand a pointed saber

810
00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:14.079
he teaches those whom he favors to kill
their enemies

811
00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:18.640
masters and servants he stirs up trouble
and dissension

812
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.200
he commands 30 legions
while in possession of gretchen andros

813
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.440
does stir up trouble but none of the
poltergeisty kind of floating furniture

814
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.640
stuff andros uses relatively mundane
practices to destroy lives one of abby's

815
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.760
friends he tricks into drinking a weight
loss shake which turns out to have

816
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.599
tapeworm eggs and this friend nearly
dies because she did not realize that

817
00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:42.960
she was loading her body up with
parasites tapeworms have been used as a

818
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:47.760
weight loss fad since the victorian era
but have a number of very serious health

819
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.760
consequences and yes it was very
available in the 1980s another friend is

820
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.200
catfished by gretchen into believing a
teacher was madly in love with her and

821
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.200
driven kind of crazy by it whereas the
tapeworm girl was body conscious this

822
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:06.079
girl is romance deprived andras preyed
on the natural insecurities that teenage

823
00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:10.240
girls have and then used readily
available tools in fact while abby is

824
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.079
relatively upbeat and likes to engage in
the frivolous elements of 80s culture

825
00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:18.720
andros a proxy of gretchen is a grim
reminder of the things that we choose to

826
00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:23.440
not remember about the 80s weird racist
rituals that were left in the past

827
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.680
emotional abuse from parents zealotus
christian values imparted on homes that

828
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.319
kept you from engaging in culture an
entire community's refusal to even talk

829
00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:37.280
about sexual abuse none of these things
are caused by the demon but he uses all

830
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.640
of these things to manipulate the world
into being

831
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.280
quite worse for everyone involved
in the end the evangelical exorcist they

832
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.599
recruit fails and flees the sight of the
exorcism the demon torments abby until

833
00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:53.839
she conducts an exorcism of her own
casting the demon out in the name of the

834
00:58:53.839 --> 00:58:57.920
gogos madonna and all the things that
she and gretchen love which is a very

835
00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.799
charming way to subvert the exorcism
horror genre and all in all

836
00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:07.280
this is a very balanced depiction of the
80s and when i hope that more nostalgic

837
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.760
media will engage in because
for all we may have fond memories of the

838
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.640
past or fondness for the past
we can't lose sight of how these things

839
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.240
fit
into the whole culture of the day and

840
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.760
it's important to have media like this
which explicitly reminds us that things

841
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.799
weren't always so great in the past
because even outside of media there are

842
00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:33.040
forces in the world who want to try to
convince us that things were always

843
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.319
better back in the day

844
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.280
this is funny because while i've
mentioned that nostalgia in media often

845
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.960
involves a process of removing political
realities it turns out that the

846
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.200
political reality of today is heavily
rooted in nostalgia even the biden

847
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.920
campaign in both the primary and general
elections was marred in messaging that

848
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.000
urged america to go back
which is even more hilarious because

849
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.599
history indicates that the most
successful democratic winds are earned

850
01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:12.400
off of iconography and slogans that
encourage americans to look forward to

851
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.440
tomorrow in most cases where nostalgia
in politics is to be found it's used in

852
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.799
conservatism conservatism itself is
focused on conserving a particular

853
01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:26.839
national identity so it makes sense that
this is a frequent tactic from these

854
01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:31.040
politicians the ideological objective of
right-wing politics is indeed focused on

855
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.480
presenting a mythology that a culture
has lost something good and that in

856
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.520
order to become a great nation they must
rebuild the nazi party for instance

857
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.240
loathed the social climate of berlin in
the weimar republic and urged germans to

858
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.520
believe that it would be possible to
rebuild

859
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.079
the holy roman empire however the holy
roman empire itself was not cohesive

860
01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:55.520
with the political structures that the
nazi leaders wanted to maintain before

861
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.520
its collapse it was a complicated
network of nobility of varying titles

862
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.480
controlling vastly disparate swaths of
europe yes there was an emperor to whom

863
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.160
these nobles swore fealty
but it couldn't have been easy appeasing

864
01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.960
all of these rivals the nazis wanted
more consolidation of power so even

865
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.520
there the promise of reconstructing the
empire was misleading these promises

866
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.040
were an idea that presented feelings of
greatness but were divorced from the

867
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.359
historic context similarly how american
conservatives and republicans

868
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:29.520
chronically pine over the 1950s as
presenting this kind of white dominant

869
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.079
simple living gender conformist
aesthetic you'd get from norman rockwell

870
01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:37.440
paintings while dancing around the fact
that the highest tax bracket at the time

871
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.359
was set at 90 and someone working retail
could buy a house for a single income

872
01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:45.440
family again when it comes to nostalgia
enforcing selective ignorance is part of

873
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.880
the game because you want people to
remember the good times as a frame of

874
01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.040
reference for what you a politician can
bring to the table

875
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.240
but when you offer change there is the
question of into what will we change

876
01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.319
change in progress is an easy pick for
people who live under the boot

877
01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:06.160
if you want things to get better the
only way for that to happen is change

878
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.000
but for people who believe that they're
doing fine change is scary even though

879
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.160
when we talk about taxing the rich we're
not talking about you and your 200 000 a

880
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.480
year salary in your mcmansion and this
is especially true for a group of people

881
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.440
who can be convinced that they were once
doing fine but have fallen upon hard

882
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.920
times thanks to whatever scapegoat is
hot in media discussion hey you were all

883
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.319
doing great and america was doing great
but then all those

884
01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:36.240
gender identities showed up and now
america sucks yes an expanded

885
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.839
understanding of gender and gender
identity coincides with the

886
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:44.240
recent collapse of the american economy
that's called a coincidence unbeknownst

887
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.440
to most people conservatism is a tool to
consolidate power conservatism is not to

888
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.200
conserve the good things in life because
when it comes to the use of conservative

889
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.799
politics the last thing they want is to
return to a wealth distribution as it

890
01:02:56.799 --> 01:03:00.240
existed under the tenants of the new
deal they need their voting base to

891
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.400
remain angry and disgruntled enough to
believe that the root of all evil is

892
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.799
immigrants or queer people or feminism
so that their votes will ignore the ways

893
01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:12.960
that their politicians will hurt them
oftentimes this politically nostalgic

894
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.559
process is much more subtle though
reagan's famous morning in america

895
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:21.119
campaign ad never explicitly talks about
going back it presents the notion that

896
01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:24.720
america is doing great and that they
need to preserve this though with the

897
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.480
likes of trump this messaging is
far more overt specifically his infamous

898
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.520
slogan make america great again
not make america the best it can be

899
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:41.039
today or tomorrow instead make america
reprise a kind of greatness that is said

900
01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:45.280
to have existed in the past
and unlike other political campaigns

901
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.680
trump brilliantly though absolutely
unintentionally does not evoke any kind

902
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.160
of imagery of what prior greatness we
are calling back to instead of picking a

903
01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.599
specific era he leaves it up to each of
his supporters in their own particular

904
01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:02.000
idea of american greatness this
culminates in a vague cloud of gender

905
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.280
archetypes and cultural sensibilities
which are all too indiscernible to

906
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.280
really be aware of and this process of
groupthink develops a vision of america

907
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.400
by a committee of voters an america that
only was ever meant to exist in the

908
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.200
imagination
but hey it worked

909
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.440
and it will keep working in fact this
sentiment was so successful that it has

910
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.839
even managed to skew perceptions of
progressivism people who occupy a

911
01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:29.839
moderate or centrist political space are
becoming increasingly irritated by just

912
01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:33.599
how many rights they have to fight for
they see a life-or-death struggle of

913
01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:37.039
certain people and decry it as a
distraction from what the real issues

914
01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:40.880
are when an interviewer asks hillary
clinton democrats seem to be going out

915
01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.599
of their way to lose elections by
elevating activist causes notably the

916
01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:49.839
transgender debate which are relevant
only to a small minority what sense does

917
01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:54.400
it make to depict j.k rowling as a
fascist which

918
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.079
first of all is a loaded question just
write a [ __ ] think piece instead of

919
01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:01.760
using a clinton interview to prop
yourself up on a soapbox however

920
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.680
hillary clinton responded we are
standing on the precipice of losing our

921
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.160
democracy and everything that everybody
else cares about then goes out the

922
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.520
window
look the most important thing is to win

923
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.680
the next election the alternative is so
frightening that whatever does not help

924
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.079
you win should not be a priority okay so
if the whole of the left needs to make

925
01:05:22.079 --> 01:05:25.520
their sole purpose winning so the bad
guys don't make it worse

926
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.400
then what's the point of getting elected
in the first place

927
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.760
what are we going to bring to the table
aside from keeping republicans away from

928
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.359
it never mind that the only democrats
losing are centrists who campaign on

929
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:39.280
moderation and mediocrity progressive
democrats when they get past the

930
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.680
democratic party roadblocks tend to win
their elections we were told growing up

931
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.039
that democrats are the party you vote
for if you want to protect vulnerable

932
01:05:47.039 --> 01:05:51.680
people that's what they pushed and now
apparently there is this sentiment among

933
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.119
the democrats that even that's passe
that the republicans are just too strong

934
01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:00.720
or that the establishment democrats are
too spineless to fight for the people

935
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.280
we've been siphoning votes out of for
decades and that the best they can do is

936
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.559
just
stop it from getting worse

937
01:06:08.559 --> 01:06:13.359
making it worse how could it be worse
rampant police violence ongoing use of

938
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:17.200
the trans-panic defense regressive book
banning laws targeting people of color

939
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.319
and queer creators and the loss of
federal protections for abortion

940
01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:25.680
services including forcing women to
carry stillborn children before term and

941
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.839
all of this is happening while the
democrats control three out of the three

942
01:06:29.839 --> 01:06:34.880
branches of the federal government what
needs to happen for democrats to even be

943
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.599
competent at stopping the other guys
from winning and yes

944
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:44.000
things can always get worse
but who's going to be left to vote blue

945
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.319
as the party platform procedurally
forgets its voter base

946
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:52.160
and what's going to be left
on the democratic platform

947
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.720
after that tax breaks but not quite as
much as the republicans

948
01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.480
deregulation but not
quite as much as the republicans

949
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.280
hearkening back to clinton's sentiments
the objective of the democrats being

950
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.839
stop things from getting worse itself is
conservatism

951
01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:14.559
we need to conserve what is good and
stop what's bad we don't need progress

952
01:07:14.559 --> 01:07:18.799
we need to make sure things revert back
to a comfortable time

953
01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:22.319
nostalgia
but not quite as radical as the

954
01:07:22.319 --> 01:07:26.799
republicans and in the illusion that
political choices boil down to picking

955
01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:31.680
one of two candidates
american society polarizes not on how to

956
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.160
move forward
but what version of the past

957
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.760
to which we must regress
and so because political leaders are

958
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.720
clamoring for regression many people who
want to fight for progress are seen as a

959
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.200
distraction persecuted group a gets mad
because group b is taking the discussion

960
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:54.240
away from them people from group c are
most at risk but sub group b2 claim that

961
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.920
their needs aren't as important because
they're a small demographic and people

962
01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.160
who want to fight all these things at
the same time are decried as traitors by

963
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.079
all parties people left of center long
for the good old days of the 90s or

964
01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:10.319
2000s before the blm stuff and this
gender woke stuff hearkening to an

965
01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:13.920
imaginary period of clinton or obama
presidencies where everyone just got

966
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.159
along there are people who are so gaslit
from this that they just reject

967
01:08:18.159 --> 01:08:22.319
nostalgia wherever it may appear either
in media or political discourse there's

968
01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:26.719
this knee-jerk reaction to anything that
may even slightly indicate that the past

969
01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:30.480
must be revisited because even when it
comes to frivolous depictions of

970
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.960
nostalgia that statement alone carries a
great deal of baggage among people for

971
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.040
whom their memories of the 90s are not
focused around ace of base but surely

972
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.480
we're not at the point in society where
every piece of media whether it's

973
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.040
fiction or not needs to be developed for
the sole purpose of raising the alarm to

974
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.159
the regressive tides sweeping across the
world spelling disaster on a social

975
01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:54.159
political economic and apocalyptic scale
right

976
01:08:54.159 --> 01:08:56.560
right

977
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.920
[ __ ]

978
01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:12.719
as a feeling and as a word with a
definition nostalgia is relatively

979
01:09:12.719 --> 01:09:17.920
neutral if not entirely inescapable
it's reflexive triggered something that

980
01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.400
you can't really control
but as it is now often used to describe

981
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.480
almost predatory tactics used in media
and politics it's hard to really gauge

982
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.279
the use of nostalgia because in spite of
the many ways that nostalgia in media

983
01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:35.040
can be tied to racism misogyny and
bigotry in general i don't feel that

984
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.759
media that allows you to relive the past
is entirely invalid i feel as if the

985
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:43.920
fact that nostalgia itself is such a
divisive tactic is indicative of the way

986
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.520
that it is controlling our society
whether you love to see it or if you

987
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.679
avoid it the prevalence of nostalgia
both in media and discussion of this

988
01:09:51.679 --> 01:09:56.480
media show me that we are a culture that
is stuck in the past even if we have

989
01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.960
conflicts over how the past ought to be
depicted because while it is important

990
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.640
to recognize the tragic and unjust
elements of the past

991
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.920
it's also important to be aware
of what was good about the past two an

992
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.640
entirely pessimistic and bleak depiction
of the past leads us to similar problems

993
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.880
in the instance of queer culture this is
especially true i find some within the

994
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.120
community and allies too put down their
arms in certain situations they see the

995
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.320
progress that is made and feel that
things are progressing towards equal

996
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.320
treatment at an alarming rate what work
needs to be done when things are so much

997
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.600
better than they were 20 years ago it's
hard to help these people

998
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.600
compartmentalize progress and realize
that rights are not a monolith

999
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.159
and while rights may be progressing in
some areas they are regressing in others

1000
01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:46.400
to say nothing of the values within the
queer community itself the situation of

1001
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.000
our equal treatment
is kind of all over the place

1002
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.159
but the way right's progression is
framed in media discussion it makes it

1003
01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:58.719
seem like everything is coming up roses
compared to what it used to be this is a

1004
01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:02.080
struggle because
a

1005
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.280
even if things are better that doesn't
mean things are safe or comfortable b

1006
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.960
our rights and community needs are an
evolving shifting landscape that's

1007
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.880
largely reactionary to political and
social movements within the hegemony and

1008
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.360
see
while certain areas of the queer

1009
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.800
experience are improving
others are stagnating if not regressing

1010
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.480
rights for some but not for all is a
double-edged sword that has splintered

1011
01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.840
the queer community and soured
inter-community relations with other

1012
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.600
social groups as a for instance
the black panther party used to run

1013
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.440
security detail for early pride
demonstrations but a schism developed in

1014
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.679
the 90s when the clinton campaign of the
91 primary latched on to a very white

1015
01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:48.239
depiction of gay men and women as their
poster children for gay rights didn't

1016
01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:52.320
help that gay leaders of the time really
leaned into this whitewashing

1017
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.760
and what we got out of it was the
defense of marriage act and don't ask

1018
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.840
don't tell which destroyed the lives of
countless gay people who were victims of

1019
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.520
predatory recruitment tactics and if
they managed to survive getting shot at

1020
01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.400
and blown up in iraq and afghanistan
were dishonorably discharged losing

1021
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.640
their pensions just as their tour of
service was coming to a close the lesson

1022
01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.840
we should have learned was to not trust
political bodies that pit us against

1023
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.440
each other to play who's the most
moderate among us but a blanket

1024
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.480
description of
things are better than they were

1025
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.280
doesn't take this nuance into account
it sees the forward-facing rights battle

1026
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.760
and views progress based on a reference
of what things were

1027
01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.480
rather than what things need to be
we are told we should just slow down and

1028
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.800
appreciate the rights we already have
or else we won't make any friends a

1029
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.360
natural response of anger to obvious
systemic injustice is met with

1030
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.679
indifference and annoyance
why say things could be better

1031
01:12:51.679 --> 01:12:54.080
when we can just say things could be
worse

1032
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.159
and let everyone live their lives tone
policing is a tactic frequently used

1033
01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:02.880
against marginalized communities the
privileged who do not necessarily need

1034
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.040
to get angry over anything dismiss
whatever we have to say because we are

1035
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.880
not saying it in a way that makes them
feel comfortable and god forbid

1036
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.719
they feel uncomfortable
what they don't see is how much of our

1037
01:13:14.719 --> 01:13:18.800
lives we have spent attempting to do
exactly what they said we should do

1038
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.719
engage and debate with civility come to
the table with our hands folded and

1039
01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:26.719
follow the proper channels to go about
change and because the greater body of

1040
01:13:26.719 --> 01:13:31.199
the population does not see us do that
because we are roundly ignored when we

1041
01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:35.920
do all they see is us getting
passionately angry and assume this is an

1042
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.159
automatic first response what they see
and what the media depicts us as are

1043
01:13:40.159 --> 01:13:44.480
raving lunatics who can't control their
temper and that people who can't control

1044
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.600
their emotions may not deserve rights
because in the political climate of

1045
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.520
today like in the past some who call
themselves allies would really like to

1046
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.840
go back to an era
where we go to our graves

1047
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.840
silently

1048
01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.480
perhaps rather than a tool or device
that creators and producers use to

1049
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.679
develop media nostalgia has a clearer
use as a tool we use to analyze that

1050
01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:28.159
media instead of presuming direct intent
on the creator's behalf to moralize the

1051
01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:32.880
nostalgic depictions we can pinpoint the
ways in which a creator is framing the

1052
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.840
past as a whole what message is the
creator trying to convey about the past

1053
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.360
what elements are they overlooking in
order to favor others is there any

1054
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.719
textual evidence to indicate that they
are deliberately favoring certain

1055
01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:49.920
details or is this incidental and are
there any influencing factors like a

1056
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.520
publisher network or studio that may be
encouraging a creator to project these

1057
01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.199
messages
in the end nostalgia isn't a good or a

1058
01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:02.960
bad thing it's just a thing
a strange thing

1059
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.000
because
it's an emotional feeling for a time

1060
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.679
that never really existed
a phantom that clouds our memory with

1061
01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:14.960
rose-tinted goggles a defense mechanism
that assures us that surely times

1062
01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.920
weren't always this bad
once upon a time things were great

1063
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.199
but there's a danger in that because it
makes us think that we can make things

1064
01:15:23.199 --> 01:15:28.080
great again
but what we remember are the good things

1065
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.400
because our minds have a habit of
sanitizing the bad

1066
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.199
like i said it's a defense mechanism we
paint over the rot and cracks of the

1067
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.000
past
so it looks nice

1068
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.320
but that's really all we're doing
painting over it so that we can forget

1069
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.520
about it but it's not really gone it's
still there

1070
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.400
spreading ever further
while we pretend it doesn't exist

1071
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.520
so being nostalgic for the good old days
is fine

1072
01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.400
but looking at those days uncritically
and wanting to go back to them anyway

1073
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.520
basically means we want to return to the
uncomplicated lives we had

1074
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.199
as children
when things were simpler and less messy

1075
01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:13.440
when politics didn't exist for us
when our biggest worries were about math

1076
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.480
tests and hanging out with our friends
but we can't go back to being children

1077
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.360
and many of us don't have such fond
uncomplicated memories of childhood

1078
01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.640
because our childhoods weren't these
rockwell-esque picturescapes of kids on

1079
01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.199
bikes in small towns
some of our childhoods like the kids on

1080
01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:36.800
stranger things
have trauma connected with them abusive

1081
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.920
families bullying and the absolute
terror of being rejected by everyone

1082
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.640
because of who we are
we remember the good times

1083
01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.679
but we're seldom allowed to forget the
bad because the bad times shaped us into

1084
01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:55.440
who we are now
because we lived through the upside down

1085
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.280
of childhood trauma and made it out the
other side we were lucky enough not to

1086
01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:05.040
get lost in that dark place
so now we don't want anyone to ever

1087
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.679
ever even have to enter it again
we do what we can to keep people aware

1088
01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:14.960
of the darkness and by doing so we're
accused of forcing politics into things

1089
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.000
others don't see as political
because their uncomplicated nostalgia

1090
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.640
allows them to see it as apolitical but
we can't bend to their whims

1091
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.440
we can't let nostalgic memory loss take
over our minds we should be nostalgic

1092
01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:34.239
for the good times yes because we all
deserve a momentary escape

1093
01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:39.440
but we can't let that nostalgia erase
our memories of the bad times the bad

1094
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.000
things that have defined our lives just
as much as the good

1095
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.600
because if we don't remember the bad if
we don't remember those battles and how

1096
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.760
we won
how will we ever win the battles that

1097
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.440
have yet to come
because they are coming

1098
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.640
and we need to be ready for them

1099
01:18:18.730 --> 01:21:10.699
