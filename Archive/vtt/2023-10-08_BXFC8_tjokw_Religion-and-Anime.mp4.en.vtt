00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.839
surface level reading of Dos is that he
is either a god a reflection of a god a

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.679
prince who died ages ago or a collection
of household insects given material form

3
00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.360
by anthy depending on the version of
your story now yes if you want to you

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
can look at him like that and that who
he was is now a Spector that resides in

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
the sword Andor Castle he is the figure
who gave utena her signant ring and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.640
inspired her to become a prince and he

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.240
occasionally a reflection of AIO for all

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.000
character used in the name for Venus the
Morning Star which is associated with

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.520
Lucifer Lucifer which is dare I say a
misappropriated name for Satan Lucifer

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.199
instead originally referred to a Persian
God Of The Morning Light and Satan

12
00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.399
actually means the accuser not the devil
he was God's prosecutor not his enemy

13
00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.120
Frenemies but anyway religion and anime
fun
