00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.500
is definitely about homosexuality the
boys in the band is a 1970 American film

who gather for a birthday party the main

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
character is Michael a neurotic and
self-loathing gay man who is hosting the

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
party for his friend Harold a flamboyant
and witty gay man as the night wears on

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.920
the guests become increasingly drunk and
confrontational leading to heated

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
arguments and Revelations about their
personal lives the arrival of a straight

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.939
friend Alan adds to the tension as he is
uncomfortable with the gay culture and

15
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.920
the open homosexuality on display as the
night progresses the character's

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.000
relationships with each other become
more complicated leading to a climactic

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
confrontation that exposes their
vulnerabilities and insecurities on the

18
00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.020
strength of a classy set of New York
stage reviews and its billing as a

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.100
comedy despite its dead serious content
the boys in the band was taken for

20
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.560
gospel in an America populated by people
who had never met a homosexual in their

21
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200
entire lives the film
was not positive but it was fair the

22
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.840
only heterosexual character Alan can
easily despise the Nelly Emery because

23
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.420
he is everything a gay is supposed to be
a butterfly in heat Alan even comes to

24
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.220
pity The Battered [ __ ] in the end but
what scares Alan and the audience what

25
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.960
they could not come to terms with or
understand is the homosexuality of Hank

26
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.180
and Larry who are both just as Queer as
Emery yet look just as straight as Alan

27
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.500
the possibility that there could be
non-stereotypical homosexuals who are

28
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.640
also staunch Advocates of a working gay
relationship is presented by the two

29
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
lovers throughout the film
and they are the two characters most

30
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
often ignored by critics and analysts it
is Larry who speaks of rejecting

31
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.080
heterosexual concepts of marriage and
creating a relationship with respect for

32
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.160
one another's freedoms with no need to
lie or pretend at the end of the film

33
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.620
Larry and Hank win a telephone Truth
game that Michael has viciously devised

34
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.819
when they call each other and say I love
you

35
00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.000
it is when Larry and Hank Express
affection for each other physically and

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.019
verbally that the audience and the lone
straight party guests are most

37
00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.920
uncomfortable in contrast Michael's
inability to deal with his own

38
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.519
homosexuality is exposed as old-time
movie melodrama and Harold's final

39
00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.940
equally melodramatic speech puts it into
perspective

40
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.300
you're a homosexual and you don't want
to be

41
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.560
but there's nothing you can do to change
it

42
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.319
not all your prayers to your God
not all the analysis you can buy in all

43
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.760
the years you've got left to live

44
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.480
you may very well one day be able to
know a heterosexual life

45
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.700
if you want it desperately enough
if you pursue it with the fervor with

46
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.720
which you annihilate
but you'll always be homosexual as well

47
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.360
always Michael
always the speech encapsulated

48
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.920
self-hatred and reflected a generation
of gay men who were indoctrinated to

49
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.060
blame their problems all on their
homosexuality in the end Michael's

50
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.379
self-hatred and inability to function
became as archaic as Harold's habit of

51
00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.319
putting his weed in a Band-Aid box in
the Medicine Chest so that he could

52
00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.860
flush it down the toilet in case the
cops arrived Michael's weeping fits and

53
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.360
old movie Visions Shone light not on his
homosexuality but on the fallacies and

54
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.099
illusions of Hollywood dreams dreams
that had taught gay men that they were

55
00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.680
not welcome in polite Society Hollywood
was not moved to change a wit by all of

56
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.639
this hysteria in gay drawing rooms in
Manhattan though yet boys in the band

57
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.960
moved gay men throughout the country the
internalized guilt and self-hatred of

58
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.520
eight gay men at a Manhattan birthday
party formed the best and most potent

59
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.400
argument for Gay Liberation ever offered
in popular media it provided actual and

60
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.240
personal instances of the detrimental
repercussions of what gay men learn

61
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.720
about themselves through media
falsehoods and the film sparked the

62
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.580
first public pushback by a budding gay
rights movement against Crowley's plays

63
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.960
accepted prejudices gay protesters did
not deny the existence of such

64
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.460
stereotypes but they were quick to point
out that the Viewpoint was one-sided and

65
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.259
the Prejudice is defined as the sole
depiction or representation of any group

66
00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.840
of people by a minority stereotype the
boys in the band was a movie about gays

67
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.000
and a gay movie it was a creation born
of a subculture and reflected a harsh

68
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.740
reflection Society viewed it as if it
were a scientific trip but it was an

69
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.759
interior Journey for many gays who were
shocked by the sadness of Michael's

70
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.840
sickening rituals many of Crowley's
caricatures were misconceptions that

71
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.680
gays had accepted and even fit
themselves into since there seemed to be

72
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.220
no other option the audience for boys in
the band included gay people who had

73
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.880
grown up thinking that they were the
only gays in the world the film explored

74
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.039
passing and not being able to pass
loving and not being able to love and

75
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.300
above all else surviving in a world that
denied one's very existence but it did

76
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.259
so before an American public that was at
the stage of

77
00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.240
barely being able to mention
homosexuality at all but before we

78
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.419

actually started to be shown on film

homosexuality is solely perceived in

homosexual Liberation themes designed

110
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.279
for commercial distribution was then
released in 1973. the film investigated

111
00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:51.180
the possibilities available to gay
couples on society's terms and raised

the questions how do two guys who refuse
to play society's game Define a

non-roll-based relationship while the
film was inspired by the Gay Liberation

114

movement it was dismissed as a trivial
soap opera by The Establishment press

115

The Assumption of roles in an
unstructured relationship is difficult

129
00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:05.279
to depict on film in a poetic style
without inviting skepticism but the

130
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:09.480
filmmakers were aware of this and
purposefully opted to regard romance as

131
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.260
the bottom line as a result of the
filmmakers couching his message in such

132
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.220
endlessly romantic terms the picture
enraged the same people fighting for

133
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.820
such a political redefinition a very
natural thing had such significant

134
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.620
promotion and distribution issues that
it had little influence however it is

135
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.760
still viewed as a breakthrough film in
queer Cinema Theory classes the New York

136
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.440
Post described it as an argument rather
than entertainment while Judith Christ

137
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.000
said if the Gay Liberation movement
wants its own mediocre movie

138
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.040
here it is elsewhere in cinemas John
Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was a

139
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.079
poignant understanding and interesting
story that has consistently been cited

140
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:53.880
since as an example of a good gay film
that failed to make it at the box office

141
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.019
proof that homosexuality is not a
money-making proposition in movie terms

142
00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:02.220
the problem however was in the packaging
Sunday Bloody Sunday was a talky

143
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.120
introspective British production that
wasn't intended for a wide audience in

144
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.040
the United States it was noted in the
1980s that there appears to be very

145
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.940
little room in the American Market
anymore for the small but interesting

146
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.800
film according to producers and writers
this is now the specialty of Television

147
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.480
films interesting how history repeats
itself as small and interesting now

148
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.800
seems to be the Forte of streaming
services this film Schlesinger said is

149
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.459
not about the sexuality of these people
these movies never seem to be about the

150
00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:35.760
sexuality of the people in them these
people were a gay doctor a straight

151
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.360
career lady and a bisexual artist with
whom they were both in love Sunday

152
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.040
Bloody Sunday was not about sexuality as
Schlesinger correctly said however it

153
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.100
was a film in which alternative
sexuality was taken for granted

154
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.000
something that gay activists had long
sought it was a film on human

155
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.720
relationships and how they do not always
correspond to our expectations of what

156
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.320
love should be the film portrayed a
joyful ending for a gay character whose

157
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.640
boring resignation is not the result of
his homosexuality in his final monologue

158
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.279
he informs the audience they say
it never made you happy and I said but I

159
00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:12.540
am happy
apart from missing him all my life I've

160
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:18.079
been looking for somebody courageous
resourceful

161
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.200
he's not it

162
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.380
but something

163
00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:27.680
we were something
but America

164
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.519
despised Sunday Bloody Sunday one kiss
between the men created even more

165
00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:36.000
controversy than scenes of them in bed
together male male relationships were

166
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.579
characterized by nothing but sex yet
genuine love between men was frowned

167
00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:44.700
upon in most eyes and it was the first
time on screen when a loving kiss

168
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.540
between two men was not intended to
shock or repulse in American Cinema it

169
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.459
drew gasps from Spectators and as a
result several theaters refused to book

170
00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:57.420
the film at all however it provided gay
moviegoers with a mostly positive

171
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.779
experience even if they were the only
people in the theater aside from the

172
00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:04.980
more serious gay films gays were popping
up in small roles all over Hollywood

173
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.600
mostly As comedic foils perhaps most
famously in Mel Brooks's The Producers

174
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.060
but all of this laughter was lost on the
national gay task force which issued a

175
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.040
set of guidelines for Studios to follow
including homosexuality isn't funny use

176
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.660
the same rules you have for other
minorities if bigots don't get away with

177
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.760
it if they hate Catholics they they
can't get away with it if they hate gays

178
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.500
stereotypical people do exist but if
such a minority of any group receives

179
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.180
exclusive media exposure
that is bigotry hmm

180
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.260
television which is subject to the
regulation of the FCC and to the

181
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.399
reaction of its advertisers to vocal
public opinion was more vulnerable to

182
00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:51.120
this type of activist pressure than was
the motion picture industry television

183
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.740
programming which aired nearly 24 hours
a day was always in need of societal

184
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.459
concerns to address
homosexuality being one of them a film

185
00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:04.139
must be a success but if a television
show fails there is always next week and

186
00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.860
another subject to try therefore
experimentation was encouraged pressure

187
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.040
from Gay Liberation influenced
television's approach to portraying

188
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.240
homosexuality for the American audience
and it was successful in achieving a

189
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.100
more balanced and surely more prolific
discourse on television than in film

190
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.600
Archie Bunker Norman lear's Charming
bigot first encountered homosexuality in

191
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.860
1972 when he realized that one of his
drinking buddies a former football star

192
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.360
was gay
how long you know me

193
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.040
10 12 years yeah
in all that time did I ever mention a

194
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.040
woman
but what difference does that make you a

195
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.540
bachelor so
I know but pastors there they're always

196
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.800
acting kind of private exactly

197
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.560
oh come on
watching from the White House President

198
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:01.980
Nixon declared it distasteful
because it made a good man look like a

199
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.660
fool it is unclear if Nixon was talking
about Archie Bunker or the football

200
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.920
player that same year ABC made a
significant step forward in the

201
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.760
portrayal of ordinary gay men on
television that certain summer a

202
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.079
two-hour movie of the week presented the
story of a divorced dad who chooses to

203
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:23.100
tell his 14 year old son that he is gay
when his son arrives for a weekend visit

204
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.120
when the father eventually gets around
to describing the issue to his son the

205
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.800
boy rushes away unable to deal with it
for gay liberationists The Narrative was

206
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.000
a little too soft while it earned
glowing reviews in the mainstream press

207
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.519
several gay writers criticize it for
being too hesitant and unduly cautious

208
00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:45.720
but with the critical success of that
certain summer the barriers seemed to

209
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.519
come crashing down for television by the
mid-1970s queer characters had appeared

210
00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:55.320
on virtually every sitcom drama and talk
show in prime time TV All in the Family

211
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.459
Rhoda mod Barney Miller Mash The Bob
Newhart Show and scores of others

212
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:03.360
featured gay characters the naked civil
servant and the war Widow two

213
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.380
spectacular television dramas were
uplifting depictions of the lives of

214
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.300
lgbtq people both real and fictitious
both series instilled in its key

215
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.680
characters a sense of history and their
position as strugglers for sexual

216
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.519
Freedom both shows revealed a hidden
aspect of the gay experience through

217
00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:24.180
romance and humor although Quentin
crisp's story in the naked civil servant

218
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.279
was not a gay liberationist's Dream by
any means gays greatly admired and

219
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:34.320
respected crisp's defiant lifestyle when
you're being followed there are a number

220
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.000
of rules to obey
never look back

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.800

sir offer money it may work yet no gay
Heroes emerged on the movie screen at

228
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.839
least not until the release of Dog Day
Afternoon the film directed by Sydney

229
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:26.040
lament and starring Al Pacino is a
complex and nuanced exploration of the

230
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.940
queer experience set during a bank
robbery gone awry in Brooklyn the film

231
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.559
tells the story of Sunny a man who Robs
a Bank in order to pay for Leon's

232
00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:38.580
Sunny's Partners gender confirmation
surgery Leon isn't given a feminine name

233
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.480
in the movie FYI as the story unfolds we
learn more about sunny and Leon's

234
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.799
relationship we discover that Leon is a
pre-op trans woman and sunny is willing

235
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.179
to do whatever it takes to support her
including robbing a bank to fund the

236
00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:54.900
procedure this is a powerful statement
about the lengths that queer people will

237
00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.360
go to in order to support and care for
one another especially in a society that

238
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.080
is often hostile and unwelcoming the
film also explores the impact of queer

239
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.539
identity on the character's
relationships with their families when

240
00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:09.720
Sonny's mother comes to the bank to try
and talk him out of the robbery he

241
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.240
reveals to her that Leon is a trans
woman

242
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.240
her reaction is one of shock and disgust
another important queer theme in Dog Day

243
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.780
Afternoon is the way that Sunny
sexuality and gender identity intersect

244
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.960
with his working class background
throughout the film we see Sunny

245
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.679
interacting with other members of his
community including his friends and the

246
00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:31.919
police officers who are trying to
negotiate with him his working class

247
00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:36.299
background is an important part of his
identity and it's clear that he feels a

248
00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:40.320
sense of loyalty and connection to his
community something not often seen among

249
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.980
queer characters who were usually
artists or working in fields of high

250
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.320
esteem like universities made for a
budget of 3.5 million dollars it went on

251
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.780
to gross 56 million dollars at the box
office or 381 million dollars when

252
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.179
adjusted for inflation and was nominated
for six Oscars including best picture

253
00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:03.179
bursting the bubble of the assumption
that movies with queer characters and

254
00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:07.860
themes can't succeed but Al Pacino
returned to gay Cinema five years later

255
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.620
with cruising which
did not go over so well cruising was

256
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.340
based on a 1970 novel by the New York
Times editor Gerald Walker that

257
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.640
portrayed the process by which a New
York city policeman assigned to capture

258
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.620
a psychotic killer of gay men becomes
aware of his own homosexuality and then

259
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.740
commences killing gay men the gay
characters in the novel are all filled

260
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.400
with self-hatred and hatred for the
people who turned them gay the blame

261
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.000
usually falls on the first man with whom
they had sex the killer Intimates that

262
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.380
the homosexual lifestyle is an
inherently violent one the killer in the

263
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.580
film adaptation knifes his victims to
death during or immediately following

264
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.919
sex and the film opens with a shot of a
gangrenous severed arm floating in the

265
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:55.140
Hudson River Al Pacino's character a cop
immerses himself in the underground of

266
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.820
heavy leather and sadomasochism as the
film goes on he becomes agitated and

267
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.440
Restless a state brought about by his
own sexual identity crisis though his

268
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.580
motives are never explored or explained
when he finally locates the killer he

269
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.080
stabs him which puts the killer in the
hospital under police custody Pacino's

270
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.600
assignment is over
however

271
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.820
another murder follows
this time that of Pacino's gay next door

272
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.539
neighbor who was the only relatively
happy gay character in the movie it is

273
00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:28.740
implied in the end that Pacino himself
had committed this final murder and the

274
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.179
film ends with him gazing at himself in
a mirror in a statement to the press the

275
00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:38.340
director screenwriter William friedkin
of boys in the band said that he was not

276
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.880
sure who the real murderer was and that
furthermore he did not consider the

277
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.240
murderer to be homosexual a more likely
conclusion is that friedkin deliberately

278
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.500
obscured the identity of the killer
either consciously or unconsciously as a

279
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.539
response so the wave of protests that
arose in the summer of 1979 when he

280
00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:01.260
began filming gays who protested the
making of the film maintained that it

281
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.799
would show that when Pacino recognized
his attraction to the homosexual world

282
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:09.240
he would become psychotic and begin to
kill so freedkin avoided that situation

283
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.440
by leaving the ending of the film
relatively ambiguous yet friedkin

284
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.000
realized that his film said what gay
activists claimed it said and he had a

285
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.320
disclaimer to all Prince of the film
this film is not intended as an

286
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.020
indictment of the homosexual world
it is set in one small segment of that

287
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.679
world which is not meant to be
representative of the whole gay

288
00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:35.400
audiences around this time began to see
that Hollywood was willing to overlook

289
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.500
successful queer films but would admire
themselves in their failures the most

290
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.900
insightful and important films were
those which had been made in struggle by

291
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.220
small groups of people and against
tremendous odds the producers and

292
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.600
directors of the British film Nighthawks
spent five years preparing and Gathering

293
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.860
funds for their film about a gay teacher
who spends his nights cruising in bars

294
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.179
and discos and having one-night stands
Nighthawks offers an almost documentary

295
00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:06.900
style look into the evening cityscape of
the ritualistic life of a man who is

296
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.580
becoming aware that he lives two lives
the dispassionate view of London gay

297
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.620
nightlife allows a gay male audience to
experience the hunt as more than a

298
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.419
passive spectator there is an uncanny
feeling that each member of the audience

299
00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:27.419
is himself cruising recognizing a look a
gesture a glance then realizing it is

300
00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:31.140
meant for the character in the film
through whose eyes we are looking no

301
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.159
slick and Sensational Hollywood Peep
Show Nighthawks is a perceptive film

302
00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:39.780
with modest intentions and it succeeded
without compromising its scope for

303
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.980
commercial reasons while William
friedkin was on New York streets filming

304
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.179
the blood and guts Hollywood version of
the gay underground Nighthawks opened in

305
00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:52.440
New York and got what turned out to be
better reviews than cruising would get

306
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.580
six months later and some queer
filmmakers were willing not just a step

307
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:02.039
outside of the Hollywood System
but [ __ ] all over it John Waters became

308
00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:05.880
synonymous with the queer underground
Cinema movement of the 1970s thanks to

309
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.900
his outrageous and subversive style
Waters films are known for their

310
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.039
irreverent humor over the top characters
and outrageous subject matter he has

311
00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:17.820
always been drawn to the marginalized
and the taboo and his films often

312
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.900
explore themes of sexuality gender and
identity many of his films feature queer

313
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.280
characters and he has been credited with
helping to break down barriers and

314
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.020
challenge stereotypes about queer people

a larger than life figure both in terms

living on the fringes of society and
rejecting traditional norms

342

cohorts remain defiant refusing to be

cowed by the oppressive forces of
society their queerness is a source of

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.659
strength and a way of connecting with
others who share their experiences

summer of 1981 pre-production had even
begun on making love a major Studio film

man coming to terms with his

homosexuality and the love triangle that
develops between him his wife and

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:57.840
another man but in that same summer
a rare cancer began appearing in gay men

pneumonia cases in San Francisco and New

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.380
and suddenly
Hollywood's opinion of us

381
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.100
didn't matter so much
