00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
This video is brought to you by Wren.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.380
While the plot of The Rings of Power was kept a 
mystery leading up to its release, and some might  

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.480
argue is still a mystery, it was clear that if it 
did not focus on the Silmerillian, then it would  

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.340
flush out what sparse history existed within 
Tolkien’s works that were not proper novels.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.840
The show ended up being a loose adaptation 
of the Second Age of Middle Earth,  

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
the least explored in the books. The first 
dark lord, Morgoth — a figure similar to Satan,  

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.580
as an angel who betrayed a higher 
power and was then cast out — has been  

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.840
definitively defeated. His lieutenant, 
Sauron, however, is unaccounted for.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
The Second Age was, as Tolkein wrote, 
about 3500 years; during this time,  

10
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
Sauron mustered forces in secret, and forged the 
Rings of Power which he would then use to control  

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
the power structures of Men and Dwarves — and 
then planned to make a stand against the Elves.  

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.240
The final confrontation with Sauron was depicted 
in the prologue to Lord of the Rings movies,  

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.740
where we see Isildor and Elrond leading 
a coalition Men and Elves against him.

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.640
For the sake of expediency and dramatic 
tension, this period of time has been  

15
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.100
condensed considerably in Rings of Power. Despite 
this, both the Tolkein estate (Tolkein’s family)  

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.860
and the Tolkien society (Lord of the Rings 
Loremasters on salary) gave the show their stamp  

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.440
of approval. And they’re really big sticklers 
about adhering to Tolkein’s writing BY THE LETTER.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.460
They actually pulled strings at Amazon to 
guarantee that Peter Jackson couldn’t be  

19
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.720
involved in the production in any way whatsoever. 
They didn’t like the changes he made to the film  

20
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.420
adaptations, you see. Because… you need to 
change things… when adapting something to film

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.960
Regardless, somehow The Rings of 
Power got their gold star. And yet  

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.160
there is a DISCOURSE on the internet 
— as there are with all things. But  

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.200
a contingent of fans are outraged that the 
show is, ‘apparently,’ completely unfaithful  

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.740
to Tolkein’s creative intentions. But not 
for the narrative reasons you might think.

25
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.220
For those who know better than the 
flesh and blood of the creator himself,  

26
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
apparently Galadriel has no right to be a warrior, 
and there were no black people in Middle Earth.  

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.340
They claim that Amazon’s ‘wokifying’ The Lord of 
the Rings to appeal to a woke-liberal agenda or  

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.120
something. That they’re throwing in ‘forced 
diversity’ to appeal to a larger audience,  

29
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.160
and/or that the woke gestapo censorship 
board will have them all taken away and  

30
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.700
taken to woke-prison if they don’t 
make the lead character a girlboss.

31
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.760
And, they claim — they who are blessed with 
understanding the artistic vision of a man who  

32
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.160
has been dead since the 70s, that Rings of Power’s 
decision to make Galadriel a primary character,  

33
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.980
and their inclusion of black actors, is 
in staunch violation of Tolkein’s work.

34
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.100
That this is making Lord of the Rings ‘woke.’

35
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
I’m sorry to be the one to inform you, 
but based on a contemporary definition of  

36
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.060
‘woke’ — Lord of the Rings was ALWAYS 
kinda woke. The Lord of the Rings is  

37
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.160
brazenly anti-war, pro-racial-cohabilitation, 
collectivist, anti-industry, and pro-nature.

38
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
In fact these themes are so explicit in the text 
that Tolkein himself was nearly laughed out of  

39
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.500
his academic position at Oxford — and not just 
because he wrote a fairy tale for grown-ups — but  

40
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.600
because it was just sooOOOooo soft. So much of 
it was dedicated to men learning how to talk  

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.420
about their FEELINGS. And protecting forests. 
And dismantling industry in lieu of pastoralism.

42
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.140
YECH.

43
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.460
We want REAL, books, John. Like… a 265,000-word 
book about a guy who goes on a walk in Ireland  

44
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.140
while his wife cheats on him. Not 575,000 
words about why protecting the natural world  

45
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.560
is important. But it actually is important, which 
brings me to the sponsor of this video, Wren.

46
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.300
Wren.co is a website that makes it easy 
to calculate and offset your own carbon  

47
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.080
footprint. By answering a few questions 
you can find out your carbon impact,  

48
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.560
and how to reduce it. You can then make 
a monthly contribution to offset your  

49
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
carbon footprint by funding carbon 
reduction projects around the world.

50
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.180
The climate crisis affects all of 
us. Personally, being asthmatic,  

51
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.780
I’m extremely sensitive to very 
high or very low temperatures,  

52
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.640
so the extreme variance in temperatures 
over the last few years has made living  

53
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.560
with breathing difficulties all that much more 
difficult. But we can actually help to slow down,  

54
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.420
if not reverse these climate changes. And Wren is 
a simple and effective way to make a difference.

55
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.640
Wren has multiple projects running but their 
tree planting initiative is one that I actually  

56
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.040
really believe in. It helps remove CO2 from the 
air, and regulates the planet's temperatures.  

57
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.180
And would definitely be something that Tolkien 
and the elves of Middle Earth would get behind.

58
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.160
The climate crisis is the most nefarious and 
wide-reaching fight we have on our hands today,  

59
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.440
with the most catastrophic circumstances. It 
will take a lot to end the climate crisis,  

60
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.400
but you can start today by 
learning more at wren.co.

61
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.820
The first 100 people who sign up 
using the link in the description,  

62
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.400
will have 10 extra trees planted in their name!

63
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.400
Can I just say how awesome it is that my first 
sponsor is one I actually believe in? Feels good.

64
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.900
Okay, now before we set sail to Middle 
Earth, don’t forget to like and subscribe,  

65
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.340
we’re trying to hit 250,000 subscribers by 
the end of the year and then we’re going  

66
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.600
to release something really awesome. I 
can’t talk about it just yet but it’s  

67
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.180
worth hitting that button and 
ringing that bell. I promise.

68
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.180
NOW onto our feature presentation.

69
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.940
Oddly,  

70
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.220
the biggest sticking point when 
it comes to the discourse around  

71
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.940
Rings of Power seems to be the 
whole… Woman with a sword thing.

72
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.880
Galadriel as a warrior, clad in armor, taking 
up the sword against evil. Apparently it’s just  

73
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.100
not very ‘realistic…’

74
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.060
She, like any other fictional woman 
who’s even halfway capable of doing  

75
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.300
anything, is dismissed as a ‘Mary Sue.’

76
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.880
“Oh she didn’t have to WORK for her abilities!”

77
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.300
“She’s just good at things because 
‘they’ needed woke points from women.”

78
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.220
“She doesn’t deserve her skills!”

79
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.540
And so on and so forth.

80
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.920
This argument is dumb and I can’t believe 
that when you have your Luke Skywalkers,  

81
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160
John Wicks, Peter Parkers, and… 
every character Dwane Johnson  

82
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.860
has ever played — that we still 
need to have this discussion.

83
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.220
Legolas from the movies. He walks on fresh 
snow, surfs down the trunk of a Mumakil,  

84
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.780
and he’s just the best at everything. 
And that’s perfectly fine, apparently.

85
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.620
The Maries and Garies of Sue-dom 
DO exist. The chosen ones,  

86
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.740
the special stars, the underdogs, 
the diamonds in the rough, the—

87
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.600
“I’m just an orphan from the South side Chicago!”

88
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.180
It’s a thing. And it doesn’t see gender, 
race, or age. So we just have to deal  

89
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.780
with it. But when you’re entering the 
realm of functionally immortal people,  

90
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.640
Isn’t that the point where we stop giving a crap 
about how characters developed their skills?

91
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.640
We’re dealing with a race of eternally young 
and beautiful people whose Elf eyes see in  

92
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.700
telescopic vision and who can catch arrows in 
mid air. But the specialist person of a group  

93
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.600
of already special people having a vagina 
is where you wanna draw your suspension  

94
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.180
of disbelief? I won’t argue with you if you 
actively make the decision to choose stupid.

95
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.660
Old adage: “Never argue with an idiot.  

96
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.300
Other people won’t be able to 
tell the two of you apart.”

97
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.180
If you don’t wanna deal with 
plot armor, by all means,  

98
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.540
there’s another fantasy television 
series that’s far too squeamish  

99
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.200
to actually admit it’s a fantasy series. 
And there’s no women warriors over there.

100
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.340
Part of the problem I’m sure is that 
Galadriel doesn’t LOOK like how,  

101
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.900
apparently, a woman warrior SHOULD look. 
Nevermind that aside from Brianne of Tarth,  

102
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.940
Lady warriors don’t really have enough of 
a hold in fiction to really have a ‘look.’

103
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.440
Maybe the problem is that Galadriel isn’t 
really ‘trying’ to be pretty. Neither does  

104
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.680
she wear seductive eye liner, nor does she don 
the classic breast-emphasizing, rib-shattering  

105
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.960
breastplate usually put on female knights. And 
yet, I feel that if she did actually go out of her  

106
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.520
way to look pretty and do those things, she would 
be dismissed as being pointlessly sexualized.

107
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.420
The ire, at the core, is not about the 
depiction, but the fact that she’s there  

108
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.740
IN GENERAL. That she has a role beyond the 
one she had in Jackson’s film adaptations  

109
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.940
which was to look mystical and pat 
our gallant heroes on the head when  

110
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.080
they needed a pep talk. Which, to be fair, 
was most of what she did in the book too.

111
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.280
But if your only exposure to Tolkein was the 
films and the body text of The Lord of the  

112
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.360
Rings or The Hobbit — then yes, you may be under 
the impression that this is how Tolkein depicted  

113
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.100
the bearer of the Elven ring Nenya, and women in 
general. But if you go through the appendices,  

114
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.080
the histories of Middle Earth, and the 
Silmarillion, you realize that’s not quite true.

115
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.580
Specifically with Galadriel — there is a 
reason they chose her to carry the central  

116
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.360
plot of Rings of Power. In the appendices of 
The Lord of the Rings it blatantly describes  

117
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.680
Galadriel as leading armies of Elves against 
Sauron in the north. While our main heroes are  

118
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.480
fighting to protect Minas Tirath, Galaderial 
is acting as the general of an Elven army,  

119
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.640
wasting Sauron’s forces. She is not just a woman 
in a fancy dress. She is a military leader.

120
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.220
We know Galadriel actively fought in those 
battles, so why not battles in the past?

121
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.380
The Rings of Power DOES take place in the Second 
Age, where information on all characters is  

122
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.460
relatively sparse — at least before the Rise of 
Sauron and the forging of the Rings. There is a  

123
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.920
limited amount of information about what Galadriel 
was doing — some real broad strokes kinda stuff.

124
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.080
If Tolkein had some never-published biographical 
information that specifically says that Galadriel  

125
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.120
did not do these things (and there IS a 
lot of hidden writing that his estate is  

126
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.440
gradually publishing), then they would not 
give the series their blessing. As they did.

127
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.200
But the more you realize that this whole Galadriel 
business is wacko the more you see that this is a  

128
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.240
problem in genre fiction as a whole (particularly 
those which lean into action and adventure). It’s  

129
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.580
okay to INCLUDE women, but there are very strict 
guidelines for how they ought to be included.

130
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.820
Namely… if a woman’s role isn’t 
exclusively to assist men,  

131
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.320
then she’s a Mary Sue. She needs to help 
funnel all the attention to a male co-lead,  

132
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.680
because that’s where HER attention 
needs to be primarily directed.

133
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.760
And it’s one thing to say: “I don’t 
identify with this central characters,  

134
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.740
therefore I have no interest in this media,” 
and just disengaging. But the problem is a  

135
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.120
lot of men — especially white men — seem 
to adopt this OUTRAGE that something that  

136
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.160
was never promised to be FOR them is being 
taken away FROM them. Like any space that  

137
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480
is given to anyone else is a space that 
is taken away from them on principle.

138
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.460
It seems that ‘inclusion’ — to this 
audience — stops there. Including  

139
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.760
people. There’s no discussion about 
how these people would like to BE  

140
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.360
included. And forget about any media 
that is made specifically FOR them.

141
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.820
After all, when Legolas is a bad ass,  

142
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.500
it’s because ‘reasons.’ When Galadriel 
is a bad ass, it’s ‘woke garbage.’

143
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.780
And by all means if you just didn’t know that all 
the weird fictional history that Tolkien included  

144
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.340
in footnotes was actually meant to be taken 
seriously, then that’s fine. But then again,  

145
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.380
if you don’t know the nitty-gritty details 
about something, do some research first  

146
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.900
before acting like you do. These are things *I* 
know, and I’m far from being a Tolkien scholar.

147
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.280
But there’s a reason for why, when people are 
confronted with Galadriel’s canonical martial  

148
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.780
and marshaling skills, they go silent. Or 
they ignore the counterpoint all together.  

149
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.280
It’s because the reality of the lore does not 
align with how they have been conditioned to  

150
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.560
approach fantasy tropes in general. And this is an 
unfortunate state of Fantasy in this day and age.

151
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.280
While recently, we have been making 
strides to diversify the genre;  

152
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.220
for the longest time it was very white and very 
masculine. And even though Lord of the Rings is  

153
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.960
almost entirely responsible for fathering the 
modern fantasy genre, it seems ‘The Fellowship’  

154
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.220
was the only thing that was really emulated. 
And neither the pretty gay, traumatized country  

155
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.300
boys nor the powerful women doing stuff 
on the sidelines ever really translated.

156
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.400
And so their arguments shift away from Galadriel 
specifically. These people have already decided  

157
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.480
Rings of Power is bad because it challenges 
their privilege, so they need to pivot.  

158
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.700
They wouldn’t want to look sexist next to 
their very white girlfriends, now would they.

159
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.360
So suddenly the black Elf or the black 
Dwarf or the black Harfoot (progenitor  

160
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.740
of Hobbits) are proof POSITIVE that 
the creators at Amazon Prime have  

161
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.540
maliciously exploited the source content 
to perpetuate their woke liberal agenda.

162
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.860
(Imagine Amazon being woke…)

163
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.240
Because, they claim, Tolkein would 
never write anything of the sort.

164
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:48.240
Galadriel’s role in the fight against capital-E 
Evil is front and center of ‘The Discourse,’ but  

165
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.300
it’s kind of a nothing-topic. Galadriel led armies 
in the War of the Ring. Elves have generations  

166
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.580
to master martial abilities. There is sufficient 
enough evidence in Tolkein’s extensive writings to  

167
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.180
justify an adaptation that includes her leading 
the fight against darkness in the Second Age.

168
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.340
Though there’s no textual evidence that she did 
so, this is an adaptation. And though we love the  

169
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.300
Peter Jackson trilogy (I consider the three movies 
as one to be my favorite movie of all time),  

170
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.580
Jackson made plenty of changes that we just 
forgive now. Such as Arwen: Warrior Princess.

171
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:25.500
But the more sinister issue from what I can 
see is the ever-prevalent and yet quiet racism  

172
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.940
regarding the discourse of black characters. 
I feel as if the reason this line of complaint  

173
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.580
is being allowed to run its course is mostly 
due to the fact that Twitter is so overused  

174
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.260
to a discussion about what skin colors 
should or should not be allowed in fantasy  

175
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.300
that collectively everyone's just ignoring the 
haters in the hopes that they’ll just go away.

176
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.160
Though I am, at least somewhat, 
concerned that this is going to  

177
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.600
result in an emboldening of these bigoted 
ideals. Especially because, at a glance,  

178
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.260
the arguments seem valid. They say: “There can’t 
be any characters of color in Middle Earth because  

179
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.360
Tolkein (a British man born into colonized South 
Africa) was only writing about white characters.”

180
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.220
And supporters of this argument often cite 
authenticity to the source material for WHY  

181
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.520
all the characters MUST be white to 
remain faithful to Tolkein’s vision.

182
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.220
However, as Tolkien is, more or less, the 
grandfather of modern Fantasy fiction, I feel  

183
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.140
like it’s important to address these arguments 
in the context of the Lord of the Rings. And  

184
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.200
also how characters of color are not NECESSARILY 
excluded from Tolkein’s world building — at worst,  

185
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.120
they’re not incompatible.

186
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.000
I generally avoid going too deep into 
discussions around race because I’m pretty white,  

187
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.500
and I certainly benefit from white privileges. 
I am reluctant to discuss issues around racism  

188
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.260
in media because my opinions are observational 
— not lived experiences. And yes, even instances  

189
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.620
of what some may decry as ‘forced inclusion’ are 
important because visible representation is good  

190
00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.900
regardless of what a creator may have intended. 
Forced whiteness happens far more often, with  

191
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.180
the vast majority of historical fiction between 
Greece and Egypt being cast with white actors.

192
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.780
However, I DO want to provide 
not only canonical evidence,  

193
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.580
but historical fact for why this 
inclusion is not only possible,  

194
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.500
but faithful to history and probably 
Tolkein’s writings themselves.

195
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.140
In Middle Earth, there are indeed faraway lands 
which do indeed host people of color. There’s a  

196
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:30.420
kind of distant oriental-coded desert land with 
dark skinned people. Which I feel is where a lot  

197
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.800
of these expectations come from. Reading into 
the argumentative structures of fantasy-purists,  

198
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.560
people of color are permitted in Eurocentric 
fantasy… but they MUST feel exotic to the plot.
  

199
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.640
THIS is the context in which some 
fantasy-purists seem to accept  

200
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.020
characters of color — if at all. (At least 
from what I’ve observed.) And naturally,  

201
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:54.480
this permissible ‘othering’ process does not 
require (in fact, it discourages) accurate  

202
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.400
portrayals of the ethnic cultures from which 
it draws inspiration. Accuracy requires nuance,  

203
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.620
which requires a subplot that will take attention 
away from the epic romance — or what HAVE you.

204
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.600
The result being this orientalist mosaic 
of visual and purely aesthetic cues pulled  

205
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.100
from a number of cultures from a number of 
eras. Whether or not it’s done in good faith,  

206
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.580
I’m sure, is up to a case-by-case 
basis. The thing is though,  

207
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.740
in high fantasy specifically, this is 
less problematic and just… kinda… lazy.

208
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.100
There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of 
understanding from a lot of writers about  

209
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.540
what different fantasy ‘races’ are supposed 
to be other than “These ones are like 18th  

210
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.280
century Persians, these ones are like 16th 
century Chinese, these ones are African.”  

211
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.700
You know, the ONE African culture.

212
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.660
Given the care and effort many writers put 
into creating their cultural range of Elves,  

213
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.680
Dwarves, and cat people, you’d think 
they’d be more than willing to research  

214
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.840
actual history for their tokenistic non-white 
foreigners. At least, to his credit perhaps,  

215
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.980
Tolkein made absolutely no attempt to include 
these foreign cultures beyond throwaway mentions.

216
00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.380
Because in Tolkein, the use of multiple races — 
elves and dwarves and humans specifically — was  

217
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.420
always MEANT to represent different races and 
cultures. With no shortage of racial tension  

218
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.440
between Legolas and Gimli, it’s abundantly 
clear that the entire point of The Lord of  

219
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.020
the Rings is various races coming together to 
fight against the forces of capital-D Darkness.

220
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.400
Tolkien himself served in the first World 
War, where the British Empire called upon  

221
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.920
the provinces to send their best men to fight. He 
saw a myriad of various cultures coming together  

222
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.020
to fight a problem that was… admittedly… 
primarily a ‘British’ problem. The issues  

223
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.300
arising from internal European political 
issues would have likely gone unnoticed in,  

224
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.680
say, India or Hong Kong — were 
it not for British colonialism.

225
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.780
Suffice to say, Tolkein wrote his racial subtext 
to carry his observations. When different cultures  

226
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.400
put aside their prejudice and work together 
— things are GOOD. When they do the opposite,  

227
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.900
things are BAD. When people are allowed to 
be different things are GOOD. When people  

228
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.340
are homogenized into an ethnostate, 
such as with Orcs, things are BAD.

229
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:05.580
Racial tensions in The Hobbit’s Battle of Five 
armies bear a resemblance to World War 1 or a  

230
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.440
mindless resource war. There was no reason for any 
of these nations to go to war aside from greed.

231
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.240
However, we can see The Lord of The Rings as a 
reflection of his thoughts on World War Two — with  

232
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:21.300
the ominous and obvious evil of fascism REQUIRING 
the world to go to war. Even the Ents and Eagles,  

233
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.740
which usually stay removed from the 
conflicts of man, do their part. In  

234
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.600
order to halt the advance of Evil, Elves 
and Dwarves needed to appreciate the other.

235
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.140
Legolas and Gimli join the fellowship in 
spite of their mutual distrust toward each  

236
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.760
other . But over the course of three books 
of shared trauma, there’s so much camaraderie  

237
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:45.360
between them that they sail off into the 
west together, like good heterosexual bros.

238
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.160
The use of races in modern fantasy and — in 
science fiction, the use of aliens — has,  

239
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.000
since Tolkein, been meant to be 
a stand-in for racial diversity.

240
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.920
Most people in England at the peak of colonialism 
wouldn’t SEE the negative consequences of Imperial  

241
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.380
expansion, so it would have been a tough sell 
to convince them that maybe it’s better to let  

242
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.160
other cultures thrive independently, 
and develop cooperative partnerships,  

243
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.820
rather than force them to yield to British 
Authority. For most of these people,  

244
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.280
all they knew was ‘The British Way’ — the 
baseline of British Propaganda was all they had.

245
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.260
Using various races from Nordic mythology offered 
Tolkein a way to have this discussion without  

246
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.460
having the messaging instantly dismissed. 
The intention being that a reader of The  

247
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.900
Lord of the Rings would take away from the 
plot: the values of cultural cooperation.

248
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.280
But contrast this with older fantasy 
stories and myths. In Nordic mythology,  

249
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.800
the racial objective was for all races to conform 
to the authority of the coalition between the  

250
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.500
Asir and Vanir. Specifically the immigrant, 
warlike Asir, who were held as the highest race.

251
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.580
Odin: “Oh shit.”

252
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.740
Among Tolkein’s contemporaries, take C.S. Lewis 
as an example of the state of Racial analogies  

253
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.660
in fantasy. The ‘good races’ of Narnia are 
those who conform to Jesus-Lion's vague  

254
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.240
albeit totalitarian arbitrary values and laws. The 
‘Bad Ones’ are those who follow the White Witch,  

255
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.980
the Devil analogy, or are allied with Lewis’ 
flavor of demonized orientalist culture.

256
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.080
(And yes… it’s not a coincidence that Lewis’ 
god-jesus figure is a Lion — which is the  

257
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.300
symbol of the British Empire itself. Funny since 
there were certainly no lions on the island of  

258
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.440
Britain. But his argument was that British 
Imperial values were inherently civilized,  

259
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.200
and that other cultures would 
benefit from British rule.)

260
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.680
Tolkien himself — and this may come as a surprise 
to some — actually opposed British expansionism.

261
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.600
In letters he wrote:

262
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.320
“I know nothing about British 
or American imperialism in the  

263
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.880
Far East that does not fill 
me with regret and disgust.”

264
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.360
“I have the hatred of apartheid in my bones.”

265
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.300
Industrialism is actually one of the main reasons 
that Tolkien strongly opposed expansion — he felt  

266
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.520
that the two go hand in hand and — surprise 
— Tolkein was a certified tree-hugger. He  

267
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.060
created the Ents as a child when he saw a 
production of MacBeth and was aggressively  

268
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.020
disappointed that there were no actual walking 
trees as the three witches had promised.

269
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.040
On top of the fact that Tolkien seemed to 
earnestly want human cultures to function  

270
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:15.060
cooperatively, he also longed for a respect 
toward nature. His favoritism and clear dedication  

271
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.640
towards crafting Elven culture is reflected in 
this. The elves’ primary cultural motif is a  

272
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.320
strong connection to nature, almost functioning 
as stewards for groves and forests. Also that  

273
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.820
they most strongly oppose Sauron in this regard, 
who has NO love for the natural life of Mordor,  

274
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:35.220
which, it is alluded to, and even shown in Rings 
of Power to have once been a lush, verdant land.

275
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.660
Many Dwarves even met their end 
by over-mining inside of Morea,  

276
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.760
stripping the world of its resources and awakening 
the sleeping Balrog deep within the depths.

277
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.620
And humans rest somewhere between the 
three — some are staunch guardians of land;  

278
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.060
some relentlessly hoard wealth, and 
seek power for power’s sake. The  

279
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.480
significance of a Hobbit bearing the 
ring is because Hobbits have a strong  

280
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.280
resistance to The Ring’s whispers of power. 
Culturally, Hobbits crave the simple life:  

281
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.260
neither wealth nor recognition, but family, 
community, and an honest life. This is how  

282
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.520
Bilbo was able to wear the ring for decades 
before BEGINNING to succumb to its darkness.

283
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.260
Whereas Gandalf (wizards in Middle earth 
are kinda like Angels) was so aware of  

284
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.520
how susceptible he was to the promise of 
ultimate power that he wouldn’t even touch it.

285
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.400
This kind of Hobbit-esque community and closeness 
to the land is exactly how Tolkein felt people  

286
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.980
ought to live. He himself, a professor at Oxford,  

287
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.260
had disdain for living in and around the 
college — instead, preferring the countryside.

288
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.000
And he was hugging trees BEFORE 
this whole Global Warming thing.

289
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.580
However, in spite of this, that isn’t to 
say he was without flaw. He WAS after all,  

290
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.240
a white British citizen who, regardless of his 
displeasure at expansionism, did benefit from  

291
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.640
British Imperial status — whether he knew it or 
not. Regardless of how culture-conscious one may  

292
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.920
consider themselves, especially in eras where the 
exchange of information and ideology is not fluid,  

293
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.860
there are naturally going to be areas where 
propaganda forms the basis of one’s ideologies.

294
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.260
Though the Orcs were actually derived from the 
brutish types of the Oxford Rugby Club (hence  

295
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.180
the acronym for describing creatures who, in The 
Hobbit, were simply ‘goblins’), he later described  

296
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:30.420
their physical appearance as resembling “the 
least lovely mongol-types.” Tolkein, after all,  

297
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.820
was developing these opinions in a post-WW2 
European Allied front. His perception of East  

298
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.320
Asian people as a whole probably was coloured 
to a significant degree by wartime propaganda.

299
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.260
…Still kinda nasty though.

300
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.580
Tolkein also lived in the early half of the 
20th century, where there was no corrective  

301
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.040
discourse to lean people away from thinking like 
that. Despite having many culturally progressive  

302
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.280
viewpoints, very few individuals are invulnerable 
to cultural attitudes of their day and age.

303
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.280
No ‘but.’

304
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.680
Tolkein said some racist crap. He likely held 
racist sentiments in spite of writing content  

305
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.220
about the benefits of races working 
together. This does not excuse him;  

306
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.380
he and his work need to be fit into the context 
of the cultural zeitgeist of post-war Europe.  

307
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:22.920
What was ‘progressive’ in the context of THEN 
does not need to mean it is progressive today.

308
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.380
But what it SHOULD do is inspire us to realize 
how much further we need to be than THAT.

309
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:35.040
I am often annoyed about how other white 
people will use ‘everybody was racist back  

310
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.960
then’ as a way — not to frame systems of 
privilege and oppression as they existed  

311
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.580
during peak colonialism — but as a defense 
to shield cultural and political figures  

312
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.960
from criticism. This is often used to 
venerate figures like Joseph Conrad.

313
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.840
“Oh… Heart of Darkness isn’t ACTUALLY racist,  

314
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.340
because it was relatively LESS racist 
than other writers’ work at the time.”

315
00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.480
Our scholars seem to be reluctant to admit that 
some of the most influential figures perpetuated  

316
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.060
racist ideologies, and will go through a battery 
of mental gymnastics to justify their defense.

317
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.500
And again I’m not excusing Tolkein 
either. Some of his beliefs were wrong.

318
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.020
However, the text and theme of Tolkien's writing  

319
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.400
is in dismantling imperialism, racial cooperation, 
and favoring pacifist pastoralism. That said,  

320
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.360
far be it from me to use messaging from a work 
of fiction and assume it applies to the creator  

321
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.280
also. Rowling has done some serious psychic 
damage to our cultural consciousness. Just  

322
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.740
because progressive sentiments CAN be read into 
Tolkein, does not mean the man himself held them.

323
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.600
(And yes there was like…plenty of 
implicit racism in Rowling’s work…  

324
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.100
when you actually… read it back as an… adult…)

325
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.940
The problem here is that, unlike Rowling, 
Tolkien is dead. He neither has the ability  

326
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.500
to elaborate on a contemporary reading of 
his work, nor does he have the ability to  

327
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.580
learn from mistakes and change his thinking — 
if that is something he would be willing to do.

328
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.080
Bear in mind that ‘the old person set 
in their ways’ is a myth. Look at people  

329
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.340
like Jane Fonda and Bernie Sanders, who were 
already pretty damn progressive in the 1960s,  

330
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.720
and have only gotten more accepting 
as time went on. Fonda, in particular,  

331
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.000
has become a climate warrior in her later years,  

332
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.780
using her money to bring awareness and save the 
planet for generations she’ll never live to see.

333
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.720
I like to think that, provided 
the opportunity to be corrected,  

334
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.160
Tolkein would have taken it. This is based 
on the content of his writing, which does  

335
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:29.040
include an open-mindedness that is uncommon 
of writing for his lifetime and earlier. And,  

336
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.060
also based on textual evidence, I do believe 
that Tolkein never intended Middle Earth to be  

337
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.780
homogeneously ‘white.’ Even if it was 
not on his mind while he was writing,  

338
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.440
I don’t think he would have been upset 
by the inclusion of people of color.

339
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.170
Of course… I never met the guy though.

340
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.400
Whether or whether not that is optimism 
on my part will never be known. And  

341
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.480
this is something I AM willing to be wrong 
about, if evidence to the contrary arises.

342
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.920
Probably something I should have led with is that 
— in the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings,  

343
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.560
during a very gratuitous description of 
Hobbit culture and appearance, Tolkein  

344
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.660
errantly describes (some of) the Hobbits 
as having ‘brown skin.’ This, of course,  

345
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.860
varies depending on the various lineages 
of Hobbits. Those descended from Harfoots,  

346
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.180
which are the hobbitty people we follow in 
the Rings of Power, had the darkest skin.

347
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.740
…It’s in the literal text.

348
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.820
It’s right there.

349
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.260
This is contrasting, of course, against the 
Orcs — described as having ‘black’ skin,  

350
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:28.200
which some read as racial coding. But given that 
he describes hobbits as having ‘brown’ skin,  

351
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.080
I’m inclined to believe he meant that the 
black skin of the Orcs was more like… tar  

352
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.540
or oil. The bi-product of the increasingly 
industrializing world he hated so much.

353
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.440
And, like with women in roles typically 
reserved for men (such as Aowen,  

354
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.660
slayer of the Witch King) this is a problem that 
not only permeates the entire fantasy genre,  

355
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:54.600
but which is propagated by a loud minority 
online who hate inclusion like this.

356
00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:01.200
Again — Tolkein — said some crap. But these 
textual and subtextual messages in this very  

357
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:08.340
pivotal piece of the genre’s history should 
embolden modern fantasy consumers to demand  

358
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:13.860
more inclusion, and highlight just how little 
the ‘haters’ actually know about the genre.

359
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.180
Hypothetically speaking,  

360
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:22.140
let’s say Tolkein did intend for an all-white, 
completely homogenized depiction of Middle Earth.  

361
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.000
Just like references to tomatoes, a vegetable 
that was not native to Europe, are not  

362
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.400
historically accurate, an all-white depiction 
of medieval Europe is not accurate either.

363
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.920
Contrary to Hollywood depictions, Europe was, 
while far from the pinnacle of diversity,  

364
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.880
host to a wide range of peoples. 
Owing to its prosperity in wool,  

365
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.020
the continent was based around an export 
economy. There’s a wide range of travel  

366
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.300
logs from the more urbanized Middle East outlining 
the culture of the villages and repurposed Roman  

367
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.520
forts that now served as the political and 
economic hubs of this gentle, temperate land.

368
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.320
Urban centers of Medieval and Renaissance 
Europe would be home to a wide range of  

369
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.820
merchants, traders, diplomats, politicians, 
artists, and travelers who were not white.

370
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.080
Landed immigration is not an invention 
of the 19th and 20th centuries. Human  

371
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.500
beings have migrated and intermixed 
as long as trade has been a pivotal  

372
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.940
element of national survival. The greatest 
cultures on the planet — then and now — are  

373
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.020
those that welcomed diversity, or at 
least approached it with ambivalence.

374
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.340
So in the event that Tolkein — or any other 
creator — used medieval Europe as a setting  

375
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.900
and depicted a homogeneously white cast… 
They’re just egregiously wrong. ESPECIALLY if  

376
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.460
they cite ‘historical accuracy’ as a 
reason for why you think everything  

377
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.480
should be white-washed. In which case, 
adapting these works of fiction to fit  

378
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.700
our current understanding of history is not only 
‘correct’ — but it enriches the original creation.

379
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:50.220
[Beloved all-white fantasy story] is BETTER 
because we have corrected some of the author’s  

380
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.900
historic misunderstandings. Historical context 
is added to the story, and the world in which  

381
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.400
this story takes place is richer because 
it contains geo-political implications.

382
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.820
Migration is part of human history. So are 
strong women. So are feminine men. And it has  

383
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.920
always struck me that a genre like fantasy, 
which in the very description requires the  

384
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:17.160
use of creation and imagination, is so limited 
to white, straight men doing masculine things.

385
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.520
A man with a sentient book of 
spells fighting dragons with  

386
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:26.280
a sword forged out of mythical metals? 
Perfectly fine. But swap the skin color  

387
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:32.040
or add mammary glands and suddenly it’s 
‘inaccurate,’ ‘forced,’ or ‘political.’

388
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.860
So in spite of the fact that gender-inclusion and 
racial diversity are done deals as far as history  

389
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.460
is concerned… what does that mean for US? Queer 
people, who have struggled to justify our own  

390
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:50.040
visibility in history, and whose manifestation 
of queerNESS has occupied a very wide range of  

391
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:57.360
identities and cultural conditions of 
acceptance? Are we ALSO unimaginable?

392
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.820
The Lovers of Modena is a culturally significant 
archeological find excavated near Modena,  

393
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:14.400
Italy in 2009. Believed to be buried between 
the 4th and 6th century BC — when life in  

394
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.180
pre-Roman Italy was locked in tribalism. 
They are now on display in the city’s Museum.

395
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.240
Interred side-by-side with 
their hands clasped together,  

396
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.440
this is a strong cultural message that 
even when life was nasty, brutish,  

397
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.480
and short — our ancestors believed that true love 
transcended death. It’s a romantic sentiment.  

398
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.760
They are inseparable in death; it stands 
to reason they were inseparable in life.

399
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.340
However a few years ago, researchers from Bologna 
confirmed that both skeletons had Y-chromosomes.  

400
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:47.400
Suddenly, the Lovers of Modena, a symbol of 
eternal love, became the BROTHERS of Modena.

401
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.260
I mean nearly everyone called BS on that so 
it doesn’t really matter. Modern historians,  

402
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.820
allegedly, approach their study with a 
degree of sobriety — history journalists,  

403
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.880
on the other hand, seem to believe 
that they can only publish an article  

404
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.960
if it is palatable to a straight, cis audiences.

405
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.120
Regardless in where the error in communication 
lies, the fact remains, many people believe that  

406
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.360
‘The Gays’ were invented in the 1800s, if not 
the 1960s. That lesbians don’t actually exist  

407
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.380
because it’s perfectly normal for every girl 
to have that one special GAL PAL. And trans  

408
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.520
people only started existing with Caytlin 
Jenner or, worse, The Silence of the Lambs.

409
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.040
I mean if gay people are as 
imaginary as wizards and goblins,  

410
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.760
you’d think we’d be lining the pages of 
fantasy books. Funny story about Unicorns  

411
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.720
is that they’re actually an ancient Greek 
invention. Thing is, they never appeared  

412
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.760
in Greek myth because they ACTUALLY BELIEVED 
they were real. (It’s likely they were derived  

413
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.920
from the stories of travelers told about 
rhinoceroses from deep African explorations.)

414
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.700
To history, we’re fairies. 
To fantasy, we’re unicorns.

415
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.420
But one thing that everyone seems to 
agree on is that neither fairies nor  

416
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:57.240
unicorns ACTUALLY exist. They’re just things 
that go into stories. But only SOME stories.

417
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.880
I’m referencing this from a hypothetical 
proposition in The Rings of Power — the  

418
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.600
fact that everyone’s reading Elrond 
as gay. Or Bi. We know that he DOES  

419
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.860
have a daughter. Granted childbearing 
doesn’t necessarily mean you have to  

420
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.680
love or be attracted to the co-parent. For 
everything else, there’s a turkey baster.

421
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.220
Anyway — I’m kinda like: you know it 
would be REALLY cool if they actually  

422
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.380
made elves kinda bisexual. I guess if you’re 
a collective of immortal tree-worshippers,  

423
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.760
just ONE gender is gonna get boring after 
a while, so why not try it all out, right?

424
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.620
But then I’m like… Oh damn.

425
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:36.540
How is Twitter gonna explode if that DOES happen? 
The WAVE of ‘definitely not homophobia’ that we’d  

426
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.680
see? And in spite of the fact that these 
are immortal characters who do not exist  

427
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.680
in a post-christianized cycle of homophobia, and 
instead are fashioned to resemble more celtic and  

428
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.380
nordic sensibilities, both cultures which found it 
was perfectly acceptable for guys to platonically,  

429
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.160
well, you know — for some reason 
these fantasy people with a fantasy  

430
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.540
culture and a fantasy language and 
a fantasy religion are PREDICATED on  

431
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.220
puritanical christian values regarding 
with whom it is acceptable to copulate.

432
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.800
It doesn’t make the slightest sense to me why we  

433
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.300
haven’t just collectively decided that 
elves are queer. Hashtag: OccupyElrond.

434
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.520
And of course, when it comes 
to fantasy these days, The  

435
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.980
Rings of Power is naturally going to compete with…

436
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.960
House of the Dragon.

437
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.040
A discussion about representation in fantasy 
— especially of queer characters is going to  

438
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.580
draw a comparison to Game of Thrones and 
its current spinoff series. Both of which  

439
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:33.360
have HAD queer characters. I say HAD because 
they usually end up dead within a season.  

440
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.280
Can’t keep us around too long or else we might 
start to stretch the suspension of disbelief.

441
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:44.220
Nevermind that, yes, we have existed at all 
points throughout history. And even sometimes  

442
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.900
—out— among the ruling classes where there 
was a safety net of affluence to protect us.

443
00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.360
But if I am predicting a wave of controversy 
over Gay Elrond, how did Game of Thrones escape  

444
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.400
that controversy with Oberon, Loras, 
and Renly, and now Laenor and Joffrey?

445
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.620
Well. They died. First off. Except Laenor,  

446
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:06.000
he’s alive for now. But the rest all 
died kinda pointlessly. Yes. Even Renly.

447
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.600
Because through dialogue we are TOLD 
that he is most likely to succeed  

448
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.900
Robert Barathian for the Iron Throne, 
and while he seems the most capable,  

449
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.960
the narrative was always FRAMED around Stanis 
(the straight one) and his struggle against his  

450
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.820
brother. He was certainly not framed as a hero, 
but the narrative was framed from his perspective.

451
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:30.060
Yes, Renly was VISIBLE, but the bros could 
cop out of that representation because  

452
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.000
there was always a more typically 
masculine figure close at hand.

453
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.220
And boobs. Lots of boobs.

454
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.180
And there was never any incentive to get 
invested in his character. And situations  

455
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.380
where his sexuality were addressed 
were usually the back end of a joke.

456
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.280
The same was abundantly true for Loras, 
even though he held even LESS significance  

457
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.500
to the plot. What did he even do? People 
just made fun of him for being pretty and  

458
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:58.380
boning boys. I think there were more lines 
where other characters talked about him being  

459
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.400
queer than lines that he actually spoke. 
Probably an exaggeration… but maybe not.

460
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.200
And again — Oberon. He befit ‘the foreigner’ 
trope I mentioned earlier. As a foreigner,  

461
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.540
there is license for him to have a different 
cultural mindset. Again… there was an ‘out.’  

462
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.740
Nobody was forcing anyone to identify 
with the queers the way everyone was  

463
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.580
forced to identify with the 
straights. Business as usual.

464
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.940
But also keep in mind that all of 
these homos died horrible, humiliating,  

465
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:29.340
painful deaths — pretty bad ones even for 
Game of Thrones’ standards. Except the one gay  

466
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:34.620
brothel manager who betrayed Loras to the Faith 
Militant. Who hated… gay people… for some reason.

467
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.760
Once more we’re in a fantasy world with 
a fantasy religion that inexplicably  

468
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.000
hates queerness for no other reason 
than mirroring Christianized Europe…

469
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.600
But we’re also living in a period of time 
where it’s a struggle to convince people  

470
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:51.000
that we even exist TODAY, let alone when 
the collective idea of the middle ages  

471
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.960
was a constant inquisition to root out 
queers and women who liked plants. Which,  

472
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.980
given about 700 years of Europe’s Dark 
Ages, was only true SOME of the time.

473
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.780
If Elrond or another central Elf in Middle 
Earth is queer, that may not technically  

474
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.460
break cannon with Tolkein’s writing, since he 
never really wrote about anyone’s sexuality,  

475
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.960
but it does facilitate that they do not 
die horrible deaths on account of their  

476
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.520
sexuality. Because we know Elrond lives a long, 
long life, and then sails off into the west.

477
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.760
And we can’t have that in 
fantasy land, now can we?

478
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:31.860
Honestly I’m at the point where I’d rather 
have LESS, but more meaningful representation,  

479
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.540
then to get… THIS… and then look like 
an asshole for complaining about it.  

480
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:41.220
Again… This is indicative of a mindset 
where representation is a GIFT bestowed  

481
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.180
upon us by the hegemony — rather than 
being either an ethical obligation,  

482
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:50.580
good business sense, or affording a platform 
for people to make their own damn content.

483
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.900
I’ve said it before: when your 
base-level ‘want’ out of the media is  

484
00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:00.180
to see someone who shares some of your life 
experiences, and when many consider that an  

485
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:08.280
element of pushing a social agenda (‘being 
political’), it just wears you down a lot.

486
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.000
Sure, I would like to see gay characters 
that push the envelope and challenge  

487
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.440
conventional thought processes, but I 
also just like being able to point at  

488
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.720
the television screen because 
something feels recognizable.

489
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.060
I suppose you can say that I am preemptively 
exhausted from this discussion. Like a legal  

490
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.580
case I am assembling a collection of evidence 
and arguments to justify our existence in any  

491
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.580
piece of genre media. Especially because queerness 
has played a pivotal role in the development not  

492
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.840
only of fantasy, but science fiction also. 
As it goes for women. And people of color.

493
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:46.920
It’s really unfortunate that in order to justify 
our INCLUSION in this media, we, each of us,  

494
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.260
need to be a scholar. Meanwhile, those of 
privilege are under no burden to justify  

495
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.980
their DOMINANCE of these genres. ‘This 
is how things always have been’ is not  

496
00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.400
only a bad argument because it does 
not speak to the historic silencing  

497
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.060
of people who have developed these 
genres, but it’s also just wrong.

498
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.180
We’ve always been here in the real world. And yes,  

499
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.500
even in myths. Greek mythology is gayer 
than the Falcon Studios back catalog.

500
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:16.020
But society likes to pretend we’re no more real 
than fairies and elves. And if we do get mentioned  

501
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.820
in media, we should be happy for the mention. 
Our inclusion might take people out of the story,  

502
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.500
even if that story involves dragons and 
dark lords. Suspension of disbelief can  

503
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.520
be stretched pretty far but it might snap at 
two boys kissing and living happily ever after.

504
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.700
But we do deserve better representation than being  

505
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.220
introduced in one episode 
and killed off in the next.

506
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.880
And Tolkien probably never intended 
for us to show up in his books and  

507
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.540
stories. Maybe not even maliciously. 
Again, writing in that day and age,  

508
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.460
an old straight man working at Oxford probably 
never would have thought of us to begin with. When  

509
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:52.260
it comes to bigotry… is there a difference 
between ignorance, negligence, or malice?  

510
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.420
And how do we qualify which of these 
describes our forbearers’ problematic musings?

511
00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:02.220
Maybe we’ll show up in The Rings of Power 
someday. It’s got 5 seasons… But Maybe not.

512
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.380
But if we don’t we can take solace in the anger 
of edge lords online getting butt hurt over strong  

513
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.000
women and characters of color finding their 
way into a visual depiction of Middle Earth.

514
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.060
And maybe The Rings of Power isn’t the best 
show ever. But if we can all agree on one thing…

515
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.960
It's not as bad as The Hobbit movies.
