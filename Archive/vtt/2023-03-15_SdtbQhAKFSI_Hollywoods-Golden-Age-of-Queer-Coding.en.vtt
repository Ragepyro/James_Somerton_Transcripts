in Hollywood's early years homosexuality
found its way on screen in ways both

3
00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.120
secret and obvious to the filmmakers
behind the camera audiences rarely

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.940
pushed back against these depictions but
those who did were loud if not Legion

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
women's suffrage groups in the Catholic
Church were the most dedicated to

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.019
removing gay and lesbian content from
Hollywood movies and with the

7
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
institution of the motion picture
production code they more or less

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
succeeded filmmakers could now be fined
or blacklisted for including gay and

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
lesbian characters in their movies and
some films such as Dracula's daughter

10
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.600
were heavily edited to remove any overt
lesbian content but go figure a bunch of

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
people who came up in the industry
through artistic Roots knew how to

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.340
manipulate literary devices in visual
language to still include gay themes and

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.420
characters in their movies
though in much less obvious ways along

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
with World War II and a coming end to
what was referred to as the Golden Age

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.699
of Hollywood a time of gay invisibility
had swept over the industry but it was

16
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.840
an invisibility that you could see
through if you knew how to look but

even though Hollywood didn't always tell
the truth this kept a lot of unwelcome

38
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.340
facts and small problems from getting in
the way of the American dream even

39
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.900
though gay and lesbian people were often
the ones who made these dreams come true

40
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.340
they were never a part of it it is said
that Sam Goldwin founder of Goldwyn

41
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.140
pictures which was one of the three
Studios that merged to create MGM once

42
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.260
wanted to film The Well of Loneliness by
Radcliffe Hall

43
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.319
but when a producer told him they
couldn't because the main character was

44
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.319
a lesbian Goldwyn simply responded by
saying so what we'll make her American

45
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.659
despite goldwyn's confusing lesbian for
Lebanese the Americanization of

46
00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.940
lesbianism did happen and meant nothing
more than the simple refusal to deal

47
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.019
with it honestly it was an imitation of
the American fear of sexuality in

48
00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.099
general and the American duplicity
regarding sexual deviance in particular

49
00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.120
in all actuality it was the same
invisibility that gays experienced in

50
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.340
real life only replicated in the movies
despite this gays continued to make an

51
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.560
appearance as subtextual Phantoms that
represented the fear of homosexuality

52
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.300
itself they served as his alien life
forms that were yet firmly established

53
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.100
as part of the culture in every Walk of
Life and they formed the shadowy

54
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.600
counterpart to the concept of the
American dream sissies and tomboys were

55
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.979
used as yardsticks for what was deemed
acceptable behavior in a culture that

56
00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.120
was so preoccupied with the upkeep of
sex norms and the celebration of

57
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.139
everything masculine one performer who
happily ignored these sex Norms was

58
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.040
Greta Garbo whose performance as Queen
Christina in the film of the same name

59
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.620
released in 1934 was a challenge to the
standards of sexual and gender behavior

60
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.820
that were considered acceptable at the
time it was the Collision on screen of

61
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.840
her own androgynous aesthetic with the
reality of Christina's affinity for

62
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.500
masculine clothes and activities that
gave the picture a realism that was

63
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.759
uniquely its own Garbo who would Express
her desire to be in a film version of

64
00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.540
Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray
with herself in the title role in

65
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.220
Marilyn Monroe as a young girl ruined by
Dorian created a particular dynamic in

66
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.500
Queen Christina one that penetrated the
queer Erasure of the script her forlorn

67
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.539
longings to escape her gloomy Destiny of
marriage and her skillful rejection of a

68
00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.740
series of male suitors are broken in the
first part of the film by her encounter

69
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.300
with the Countess EBA Spar played by a
Elizabeth young their brief scene

70
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.280
together is charged with sexuality and
real affection in that scene Garbo lifts

71
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.180
the emotional barriers to characterize
her encounters with mail suitors Abba

72
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.600
suggests brightly that they go for a
sleigh ride but Christina tells her

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:02.280
sadly I can't know oh why not
ambassadors treaties councils how boring

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.300

marry and produce an heir to the throne

75
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.120
Christina refuses
but your majesty you cannot tie an Old

I have no intention to Chancellor I

her need to escape the role assigned her

78
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.039
by life was Christina's true driving
passion

79
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.080
Queen Christina makes this abundantly
clear she flees into the snow later in

80
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.180
the film when she discovers that
ebispower has betrayed her love that is

81
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.400
when she meets Antonio the one man who
seems to accept her and love her for all

82
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.199
the things that so horrify her court but
he falls in love with her thinking at

83
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.340
first that she's a man
and he seems quite willing to explore

84
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.819
whatever this strange situation may
bring in the early days of Hollywood

85
00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.720
queen Christina stood out due to the
fact that it included a character that

86
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.580
was unmistakably bisexual as well as
many instances of bisexuality in The

87
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.720
Narrative of the film itself at the time
the lives of notable gay men and

88
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.600
lesbians were either portrayed in a
manner that was drastically different

89
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.039
from their actual experiences or were
not addressed at all in biographical

90
00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.720
films this straight watching of History
has only marginally changed in modern

91
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.039
Cinema as seen by the fact that films
such as Troy A Beautiful Mind and the

92
00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.240
imitation game more or less ignore or
completely erase the fact that its

93
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.539
primary characters are gay or bisexual
it's one of the reasons why audience

94
00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.080
members were taken aback by the lesbian
relationships that were depicted in the

95
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.099
favorite even in the late 2010s
audiences of historical biopics

96
00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.419
anticipated that queerness would be
erased from historical Recreations the

97
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.720
Betrayal of noted persons as
heterosexual without regard for their

98
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.979
true to life sexuality has never been
seen as a serious offense against a

99
00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:53.520
person's identity until recently not
even by the person whose life is

100
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.539
falsified no it was better to be
straight even queer audiences themselves

101
00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:01.620
believe that especially in Hollywood's
golden age when it was a dirty secret

102
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.000
most people yearned to be rid of but
there was an odd dichotomy developing in

103
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.060
Hollywood
whereas lesbian or bisexual female

104
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.539
characters could be redeemed in a film
by being paired off with the right man

105
00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:16.800
in the end bisexual or gay male
characters had no such luxury in the

106
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.539
film Adam's Rib which was released in
1949 David Wayne plays the role of Kip

107
00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:26.699
who is a yardstick par Excellence
Kip serves as Katherine Hepburn's

108
00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:32.039
girlfriend acting as a high-class Ethel
Mertz to her feminist Lucy Ricardo

109
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.539
despite Catherine Hepburn's defense
Spencer Tracy's apparent unease around

110
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.959
him cannot be denied as they were
leaving the room following a heated

111
00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:44.219
discussion over feminism Wayne said to
Hepburn you've got me so convinced I may

112
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.540
even go out and become a woman when
Wayne has gone Spencer Tracy mutters and

113
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.000
he wouldn't have far to go either
Hepburn's Amanda can only shush him an

114
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.080
indication that her feminism like that
of contemporary feminists who wanted

115
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.480
their sons to grow up to be real men
goes only so far and breaks down at the

116
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.500
thought of actually obscuring sex and
gender roles altogether yet the

117
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.760
unyielding conviction in the masculine
role along with the hatred that this

118
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.860
ideology bred was about to be shaken to
its very Foundation the buddy system

119
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.700
that had been used during the second
world war had brought troops closer

120
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.959
together than they had ever been before
men who loved each other's company but

121
00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:29.040
always selected women to display their
manhood were forced to confront their

122
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.540
innate sexuality in the all-male
atmosphere of military forces this

123
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.880
brought to the surface a
misunderstanding regarding men's

124
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.839
fundamental sexuality
the worry that these heterosexual

125
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:45.540
relationships between men may in any way
be interpreted as being gay was a very

126
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.440
genuine one and the movies made sure
that there was no indication of

127
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.100
homosexuality involved in depictions of
such Partnerships there might have been

128
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.660
less suspicion of homosexuality had the
level of paranoia surrounding its very

129
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.640
mention not been so high
in 1946 Richard Brooks's novel The Brick

130
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.560
Foxhole dealt with obsessive masculinity
in the military in it a gay decorator is

131
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.880
murdered by a soldier he brings home to
his apartment for a drink the 1947 film

132
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.100
adaptation Crossfire made the victim a
Jewish person and thus became an example

133
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.180
of Hollywood's maturity in dealing with
anti-Semitism the New York Times noted

134
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.660
the change in a review but said only
that the motivation for the murder had

135
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.860
been changed to good Advantage The
novel's crucial discussion of men's

136
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.660
striking out at what they fear in
themselves was omitted whenever all male

137
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.019
circumstances were the topic of the
movies whether they were Cowboys sports

138
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.820
or Soldiers the fantasy of the
unfettered perennially youthful man in

139
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.440
pure and unsullied Brotherhood battled
over the ever-present societal taboo

140
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.720
against male closeness director Clarence
Brown toyed with this in his film flesh

141
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.220
and the devil in which John Gilbert and
Lars Hansen play lifelong friends who

142
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.820
separate when one of them marries the
woman they both love played by Greta

143
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.800
turbo by the end of the film Garbo has
slept with both of them precipitating a

144
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.700
reluctant duel between the two men
trying to stop them she falls through

145
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.459
some thin ice and drowns at this the men
throw down their guns Embrace and walk

146
00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:19.019
off into the sunset together their arms
around each other their bond rejoined

147
00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:23.760
following the intrusion of a woman
Clarence Brown spoke of the situation in

148
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.560
an interview you can see my problem
how to have these two Leading Men wind

149
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.220
up in each other's arms and not make
them look like a couple of fairies Joan

150
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.360
Mellon in her study of masculinity in
the movies Big Bad Wolves says that the

151
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.680
less violent men were in their film
personas The more likely they were to be

152
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.140
interested in heterosexual love just the
opposite has been true for homoeroticism

153
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.700
the perception of homosexual feelings as
a brutal furtive dangerous Force

154
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.899
flourished in films about male bonding
and violence playing off of the idea of

155
00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:59.279
homosexuality being innately Criminal
gentlemen in the movies Jimmy Stewart

156
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:03.720
and any movie about small town USA would
never even subtextually approach such

157
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.440
relationships or feelings the concept of
the gentleman who chooses to love other

158
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.420
men did not exist in American Film
except in comedy in the films of Laurel

159
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.920
and Hardy their relationship was given a
sweet and very real loving Dimension a

160
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.660
classic example of this one with
unmistakably gay overtones is 1932's

161
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.800
their first mistake Hardy's wife
complains that he sees too much of

162
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.540
Laurel and not enough of her and the two
friends discussed the situation but

163
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.920
what's the matter with her anyway no I
don't know

164
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.459
she says that I think more of you than I
do of her

165
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.740
foreign

166
00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:49.440
but we won't go into that you know what
the whole trouble is

167
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.019
what what you need is a baby in your
house well what's that got to do with it

168
00:12:55.019 --> 00:13:01.860
well if you've if you had a baby and it
would keep your wife's mind occupied and

169
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.420
you could go out nights with me and
she'd never think anything about it so

170
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.779
they go out and adopt a baby
when they return home with it they

171
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:13.560
discovered that Hardy's wife is suing
him for divorce for alienation of

172
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.779
affections having named Laurel as the
other woman the remainder of the film is

173
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.800
a beautifully timed and performed
domestic scene with Laurel and Hardy in

174
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.120
bed with the baby between them the
obviousness of the coding has been

175
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.800
lambasted ever since the film's release
with Charles Barr in his study of Laurel

176
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.060
and Hardy saying that there is something
rather absurd about discussing this

177
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.980
seriously at all
in the often infantile pre-sexual

178
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:47.040
Nursery World in which Stan and Ollie
lived such Behavior would be natural I'd

179
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.360
agree that it is in fact natural but the
idea of there ever having been a

180
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.040
pre-sexual time is reaching
but notice that it is the naturalness of

181
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.700
Laurel and Hardy's behavior that Barr
and other critics choose to defend not

182
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.620
the sexuality and so it is indeed an
attack on americanism itself to suggest

183
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.760
that homosexuality is present in the
Laurel and Hearty routines in pointing

184
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.019
these things out one attacks the
American illusion the illusion that

185
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:18.120
there is in fact such a thing as a real
man and that to become one is as easy as

186
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.100
changing one's name from Marion Morrison
to John Wayne the fact is that comedy

187
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.360
has been able to comment on sexual roles
more readily than drama could only

188
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.639
because people may dismiss it as an
impossible first neglected buddy

189
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:37.200
relationships exist even in classic
cartoons while Disney may not have liked

190
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.500
hearing it but there are gay overtones
in the relationships of more than one

191
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500
pair of beloved animated figures from
his classic years

192
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.060
in 1940s Pinocchio Honest John and
Gideon a fox and a cat are best friends

193
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.920
who procure Lost Boys for sale to an
evil Coachman who takes them to Pleasure

194
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.060
Island they seduce Pinocchio with the
hit song High diddly D the second line

195
00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.699
of which is high diddly day an actor's
life is gay in Cinderella everyone's

favorite mice jock and Gus Gus volunteer
to help finish Cinderella's dress in

197
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.579
time for the ball
but they are quickly admonished by a

198
00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:15.660
female Mouse to leave the sowing to the
women their relationship grows

199
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.959
throughout the film and later when
Cinderella describes how she was swept

200
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:23.220
off her feet by the handsome prince Gus
Gus puts an arm around Jock's shoulder

201
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.220
and holds him close
and of course from the competition there

202
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.300

opportunity the real emotions in the
movies at the time with exceptions for

204
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.920
films like Gone With the Wind always
took place between men

205
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.240
men had been the important forces at
work both as instigators of all the

206
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.860
action and plots and as instigators of
the films themselves by deciding what

207
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.880
movies should and should not be made
when screenwriter Gore Vidal discussed

208
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.500
the script for the 1959 version of Ben
Hur with director William Weiler they

209
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.760
concluded that the Rivalry between Judah
Ben Hur Charlton Heston and his

210
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.560
boyfriend Masala Stephen Boyd was
insufficiently motivated by a single

211
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.820
political scene in which Ben Hur refuses
to Aid the Roman cause despite his

212
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.380
friend's pleas
Fidel described the problem I proposed

213
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.639
the notion that the two had been
adolescent lovers and now Masala has

214
00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:23.040
returned from Rome wanting to revive the
love affair but Ben Hurd is not

215
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.139
he has read Leviticus and knows an
Abomination when he sees one I told

216
00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:32.279
Weiler this is what's going on
underneath the scene

217
00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:36.540
they seem to be talking about politics
but Masala is really trying to rekindle

218
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.320
A Love Affair
and Weiler was startled

219
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.820
we discussed the matter and then he
sighed well anything is better than what

220
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.660
we've got in the way of motivation but
don't tell Chuck

221
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.899
I did tell Stephen Boyd who was
fascinated

222
00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:57.120
he agreed to play the frustrated lover
study his face in the reaction shots in

223
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.339
that scene and you will see that he
plays it like a man starving it was 1959

224
00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:07.500
and filmmakers were on the verge of new
creative freedoms Vidal was saying that

225
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.280
it made sense that the two men should be
attracted to each other

226
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.959
theirs was the most vibrant and
interesting relationship in the film

227
00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:20.160
Weiler later told Vidal the biggest
mistake we made was the straight love

228
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.980
story
if we had cut out the girl all together

229
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.620
and concentrated on the two guys
everything would have gone better

230
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.540
director Howard Hawks always
concentrated on men in his films and in

231
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.700
his films things went better
than in Ben Hur at least in 1948's Red

232
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.960
River hox's only use for Joe Andrew was
to have her tell John Wayne in

233
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.860
Montgomery Clift what we can already see
my bit expected trouble for days when

234
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.280
when anybody would have a mind would
know you two love each other yet the

235
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.480
nature of that love despite Cliff's
scene Persona doing for his character

236
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.400
what Garbo did for Queen Christina
remained hidden despite one of the most

237
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.260
re-watched and arguably most homoerotic
scenes in any film at the time being one

238
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.360
in which Montgomery Clift and John
Ireland compare their

239
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.620
pistols the only open acknowledgment of
the homosexuality and Buddy films came

240
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.919
from those critics who attributed the
misogynist attitudes of such films to

241
00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:21.000
the covert gayness in them when Joseph
McBride and Gerald Perry in an interview

242
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.100
in film comment questioned Hawks about
the gay undertones of his films Red

243
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.720
River in particular Hawks told them it
was a goddamn silly statement to make

244
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.160
it's easy to see how directors might be
oblivious to the subtexts that are

245
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.520
present in their own work since
homosexuality is a viable alternative

246
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.340
has been repressed both in the lives of
men and in their work on screen the

247
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.840
taboo against male closeness is taken
far more seriously than it is in real

248
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:54.299
life where it is more likely to be seen
as a neutral gay sensibility some people

249
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:57.960
contend that there is no such thing as a
gay sensibility since the presence of

250
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.380
such a thing would imply the existence
of a straight sensibility which is

251
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.000
something that unquestionably does not
exist yet a gay sensibility can take on

252
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.440
various forms and it is possible for it
to be present even when there is no

253
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.419
indication of homosexuality either overt
or covert in front of or behind the

254
00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:19.440
camera the need to conceal one's sexual
orientation for such a significant

255
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.880
portion of one's life is primarily
responsible for the development of a gay

256
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.179
Sensibility
it is a ghetto sensibility that was

257
00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:31.980
developed out of the necessity to
cultivate and employ a second site that

258
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.240
would interpret discreetly what the
world sees and what the actual reality

259
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.940
may be it was gay sensibility that for
example often enabled some lesbians and

260
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.520
gay men to see at very early ages even
before they knew the words for what they

261
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.340
were
something on the screen that they knew

262
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.720
related to their lives in some way often
it was the simple recognition of

263
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.520
difference the sudden understanding that
something was altered or not what it

264
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.380
should be perhaps the role reversal of a
Dietrich or agarbo evoking a hidden

265
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.820
truth about the nature of sexuality in
general or it may have been the tone in

266
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.140
James Dean's voice as he zipped up the
jacket of the Dead cell Mineo in Rebel

267
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.000
Without a Cause And muttered
he's always called

268
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.440
it was the sense of Yearning that was
there in these encounters the unsaid

269
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.240
forbidden desires that were always there
but were always repressed even if the

270
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.419
parts did not fit together until years
later it was a voice that could not be

271
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:35.820
ignored with no real homosexuals allowed
on screen in the 40s and 50s sensors

272
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.460
often began looking for these hidden
messages

273
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.240
sometimes they found them even when
there were real things that were

274
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.380
abundantly clear in the film rope for
instance directed by Alfred Hitchcock in

275
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.059
1948 Farley Granger and John Dahl play
the role of two pretentious gay lovers

276
00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:54.419
who on a whim murder a former Prep
School classmate

277
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:58.679
they do this because they believe they
possess a superior intellect and are not

278
00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:02.940
morally responsible to a crass Society
the sensor's attention was drawn not to

279
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.179
the exact relationship between the
characters but rather to the discourse

280
00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:09.600
between them Arthur Lawrence recalls
that when he finished his screenplay for

281
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.220
rope he left England for America and
while he was in America the script was

282
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.960
passed on by American censors rope came
from an English play called rope's end

283
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.700
and while I was in New York the producer
Sydney Bernstein took a few passages

284
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.640
from the play and put them back in the
script

285
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.620
so when it came back from the Hayes
office every one of those passages was

286
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.600
circled with the common homosexual
dialogue written in the margin and do

287
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.200
you know what they were it was simply
that they were saying things like my

288
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.039
dear boy to each other and the way that
the English talked was known as fruity

289
00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:47.460
over here it's actually a long-held myth
within film circles that the reason

290
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.320
Hitchcock filmed rope to appear as one
long unedited take was so that sensors

291
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.520
would be unable to force him to cut any
perceived gay content without altering

292
00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.659
the artistic intent of the film there
were also other more covert homosexual

293
00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:04.799
relationships in Hitchcock films such as
the one between Martin Landau and James

294
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:09.480
Mason and North by Northwest and more
strikingly the one between Robert Walker

295
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.440
and Farley Granger in strangers on a
train nonetheless the filmmaker only

296
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.340
seldom offered commentary on matters of
this nature regarding his work but

297
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.419
Arthur Lawrence later said we never
discussed hitch and I whether the

298
00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:25.740
characters in rope were homosexuals but
I thought it was apparent I guess he did

299
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:30.000
too but it never came up until we got to
Casting we'd wanted Cary Grant for the

300
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
teacher in Montgomery Clift for one of
the boys and they both turned it down

301
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.679
for the same reason their image
they felt they couldn't risk it

302
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:42.000
eventually John Dahl and Farley Granger
played the boys and they were very aware

303
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.960
of what they were doing he also stated
that Robert Walker was the one who

304
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.440
suggested playing Bruno Anthony as a gay
character in the film strangers on a

305
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.820
train the strangeness of their agreement
was emphasized by the friction that it

306
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.260
caused between his malignantly Faye
Bruno and Granger's golly gee tennis

307
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.880
player guy Haynes in compensation for
the death of Bruno's despised father guy

308
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.960
agreed to take the life of Bruno's
undesirable wife and put an end to guy's

309
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.419
marriage Bruno's homosexuality emerged
in phrases that would be used

310
00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:16.380
progressively during the 50s to describe
gays as aliens because of his icy

311
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.120
demeanor his dark imagination and the
elitist superiority that he exuded he

312
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.559
was an extension of the clever but
lethal archetype Philip and

313
00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:29.940
Brandon the lovers in rope were warped
individuals who murdered out of a belief

314
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.039
in their own moral and intellectual
superiority which they believed placed

315
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:39.900
them outside the law by existing outside
the culture such gays were able to deny

316
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.299
explicit homosexuality while at the same
time reinforcing specific stereotypes

317
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.140
this is how Oscar Wilde's The Picture of
Dorian Gray could reach the screen in

318
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.120
1945 shorn of its more bizarre sexual
implications while offering George

319
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.299
Saunders as a symbol of sophisticated
decadence

320
00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:02.700
such ghettoized characters pre-saged the
gay as alien images of the 1950s and had

321
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.580
their roots in the same
anti-intellectualism and mistrust of

322
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.179
difference that had characterized the
shaping of Hollywood's image of the

323
00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:13.860
normal American man the view of the
homosexual as being alien to his own

324
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.960
Society was also present in the constant
deletion of specific homosexuality from

325
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.760
the screen adaptations of literary Works
in 1945 Billy Wilder brought Charles

326
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.320
Jackson's novel The Lost weekend to the
screen with Ray Milland as the alcoholic

327
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.299
writer Don Burnham in Jackson's novel
Burnham's alcoholism stems from a

328
00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:38.159
complex variety of reasons that include
a father fixation and a false accusation

329
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:42.179
of his having had a gay relationship
with a college frat brother in Wilder's

330
00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:45.419
version of the Lost weekend however the
motivation for Burnham's drinking

331
00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:49.380
becomes a simple case of writer's block
the only frames of reference for the

332
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.220
majority of gay people were these covert
signals and hidden indicators of

333
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.760
homosexuality in Hollywood movies the
majority of gay people learned about

334
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.840
themselves mostly through movies that
stated the rest of the world was

335
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.940
straight a documentary entitled word is
out which was released in 1977

336
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.460
demonstrated that the majority of gay
people living in the United States had

337
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.640
the misconception that they were the
only ones like them in the entire world

338
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.059
several years later when the Supreme
Court finally ruled that it wasn't

339
00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:19.440
obscene to portray homosexual content on
screen films that were more overtly gay

340
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.919
helped pave the way for the
legitimization of homosexual subject

341
00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:27.419
matter on screen nonetheless throughout
the early and middle part of the 1950s

342
00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:32.279
the invisibility of homosexuality was
enforced with an almost fanatical

343
00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:36.960
paranoia the perversity of the outsider
the Oddball or the alien screen

344
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.059
character was very noticeable in an era
built around rigid Conformity such as

345
00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:46.500
the 1950s the equation between being
different in any way

346
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.620
and being gay was easy to see
in 1952's my son John Dean Jagger and

347
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.820
Helen Hayes played the distraught
parents of a young man who is

348
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.020
well not gay but a communist agent
played by Robert Walker when their

349
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.919
suspicions about their son's activities
are confirmed it's an American Tragedy

350
00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:09.659
suddenly they see their son as Shifty
and unfamiliar a thing with no respect

351
00:26:09.659 --> 00:26:13.559
for God or country an unprincipled
monster to whom they can no longer

352
00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:16.799
relate
the healthy family disappears

353
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:20.580
Walker's coldness his superiority and
his open contempt for his parents and

354
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.100
their way of life conspire to create a
perverse unnaturalness in a 1950 New

355
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.700
York Times story The Republican National
committee chairman asserted that sexual

356
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.200
perverts who have infiltrated our
government in recent years are perhaps

357
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.440
as dangerous as actual Communists by
December of that year

358
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.799
4954 suspected homosexuals had been
removed from employment in the federal

359
00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:47.940
government the lavender scare was
gripping Washington and with the help of

360
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:54.179
a future president would soon dig its
claws deep into Hollywood as well

361
00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:57.840

keep it hidden so our amazing patrons
