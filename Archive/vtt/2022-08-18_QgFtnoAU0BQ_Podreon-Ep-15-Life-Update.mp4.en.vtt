2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.040
whatever 14 15 of the padres i think
it's been episode 14 for a few weeks no

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.400
i don't i don't think so whatever
episode this is 13 14 15. i think i

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.839
think last week was 13 because we talked
about it being an unlucky number or

5
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880
maybe last week was 14. sound off in the
comments guys what episode

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760
anyway welcome to the padre on my name's
james

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.199
and uh we're frazzled
we don't know what episode we live in

8
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.120
what episode do we live in
whatever do we live in the city we're

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.239
not even going to know what city we live
in or province we're moving but we do

10
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
know half a continent away like that's
outstanding yeah we are moving we are

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.480
moving the length the horizontal length
of europe um away i think it's kind of

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.879
like moving from distance-wise moving
from new york to washington state

13
00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.280
about that yeah yeah it's about 1800
kilometers i don't know what they're

14
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.239
like miles
our european friend like that is

15
00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
substantial like that is moving from
europeans move around so easily i know

16
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.680
but it's like it's moving from spain to
the czech republic

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.400
if not further from spain to the czech
republic

18
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.920
a homesick check
i guess so

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.720
maybe if someone was trying to avoid
spanish

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.280
fascism in the 40s
there was

21
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.920
communism no it was spanish communism in
the no spirit spain had fascism it did

22
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.759
but it was replaced
uh it replaced communism

23
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.720
that's the thing about communism and the
spanish communism is that it was a form

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
of communism that was actually
functioning

25
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.720
um and so all the world was kind of
looking at spain like is this actually

26
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.799
going to work and then the fascists were
like no yeah and that's kind of why i'm

27
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.240
kind of generally kind of of the opinion
that communism can't function because

28
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.759
either it will just be consolidation of
power like

29
00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.200
um and like stalinism yeah or it will
just or it'll be too weak to survive a

30
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.159
fascist incursion yeah
anyway that's not what we're talking

31
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.319
about today uh we're gonna talk about
fascism in the the attack on titan video

32
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.360
which i'm learning that the more i might
put this in the video the more you you

33
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.599
analyze media you either devote your
entire life to studying fascism or you

34
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.160
become one
and there's nowhere in between like the

35
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.520
more you dig your heels in the more
you're going to point one way or the

36
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.319
other well it's like for this video i
read

37
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.280
berto
romberto echoes um essay or fascism

38
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
um which
translates to eternal fascism

39
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.800
and that he's got like a list of rules
of like the any one of these things can

40
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.040
lear can lead to fascism and i'm like oh
i'm gonna need to read this

41
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.120
what was some of the surprising ones uh
oh god i can't i can't remember

42
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.080
but it was like i read them all and i
was like

43
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.959
oh dear
these all seem very familiar

44
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.519
um
but yeah so we're working on the attack

45
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.840
on titan video which is
oddly less about like is attack on titan

46
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
fascist and more
is attack on titan anything yeah yeah

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.000
even though i love it but like it it's
messy yeah we're using it as sort of

48
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.760
like a jumping point to talk about
studying literary symbols and literary

49
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.120
meaning in media and how to get meaning
out of that pop culture yeah and i'm

50
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.480
actually pulling my weight and writing
in this one i've written like 3 000

51
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.720
words i'm very proud of you yeah
we have like eight thousand we're almost

52
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.519
done believe it or not like we that's
the thing we have like six parts half of

53
00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.640
them are done and we're at eight
thousand words no no we have six parts

54
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.519
i'm finished two you finished
i finished the intro the for part one

55
00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.879
and then half of part two honestly i
don't even know if part three and four

56
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.760
need to be separate i might have just
written everything in the outline and

57
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.640
just kind of just copy pasted it we'll
we'll figure it out yeah um so that's a

58
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.720
look at our chaotic process but we are
here to talk about our chaotic process

59
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.720
over coming over the next few months
like what media are we serving to our

60
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.720
friend
yeah um because with the move

61
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.480
which is happening very quickly very
quickly because we were we didn't know

62
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.639
we were moving a week ago james a week
ago i was basically like we'll be lucky

63
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.720
if we can move
in the spring

64
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.120
that was my like golden goose of like
that's the best case scenario is like

65
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.320
april may
um and then i heard back from

66
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.520
a landlord
and

67
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.880
they were like yeah um
you know we're we're interested in you

68
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.440
as a tenant and everything and i was
like

69
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.240
huh
and because toronto is such a

70
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.240
uh
hot

71
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.520
uh real estate market for renters right
now because the problem with the

72
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.840
with toronto right now is that
houses are too expensive to buy

73
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.720
because the canadian government recently
raised interest rates and so it's

74
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.199
basically impossible to buy a house
right now

75
00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.039
so there's a lot more renters than there
was a year ago

76
00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.280
and so the renting
market is incredibly volatile and

77
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.919
furthermore this is the first year that
um universities on mass are doing are

78
00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.960
coming back and of course i'm like yeah
i'm gonna look for apartments for

79
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.720
september
um but we found one

80
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.240
yeah i found one i had to pay a year's
rent

81
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.000
up front
a year's rent like up last half full

82
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.440
that means that every dollar you get
from like income for the next year is

83
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.600
just yeah it's not right we get to
except i will be paying we will be

84
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.560
paying rent where we are currently until
november when the lease ends which isn't

85
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.360
too bad but yeah it's not too too bad
but it is still a pain in the ass if i

86
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.800
it's it doesn't hurt as bad because
the rent is prepaid in the new place

87
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.840
yeah and the new place we're not going
to be living together nick's moving in

88
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.000
with me to when we get there so that he
has time to find his own place

89
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.440
um and then there are some promising
prospects for me too like i don't need

90
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.199
anything as fancy as james i was kind of
talking to mom i was like no

91
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.720
well actually it is it is kind of fancy
it's it's like the reason why your place

92
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.840
is much more bigger and more expensive
why you have the size requirements is

93
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840
because that's where you were going to
have the telos

94
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.639
offices well yeah like the bedroom that
you will occupy it first will become the

95
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.280
productions
where we'll have the green screen and

96
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.400
all that stuff and the the editing
computer and everything will be there

97
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.520
and the monitors and everything it'll
all be in one room with a permanent

98
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.960
setup some living room doesn't need to
be torn apart and everything i mean the

99
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.919
living room will be moved around
constantly knowing you but

100
00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.600
oh yeah yeah every couple of weeks
there'll be the things will be in a

101
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.639
different place i'll take a trip to ikea
and then they're worse than my mom

102
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.840
you're worse than my mom because that's
my way of instead of buying new

103
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.639
furniture if i move the room around it
feels like it's a new room and that's

104
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.560
also the only time that you clean a
place yes absolutely i

105
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.720
hate cleaning and so in order to clean i
have to basically launch into a complete

106
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.440
redecoration of the apartment to clean
and so that's that's what happens that's

107
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.720
why it ends up happening every couple of
weeks yeah it doesn't happen here

108
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.160
because you do the cleaning but then
when i'm on my own the apartment will be

109
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
like uh
moving around constantly um

110
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.520
so yeah but it is a very nice apartment
uh it's technically a condo it's

111
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.560
somebody bought the condo they moved
away they're renting out the condo yada

112
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.240
yada um
but it's a very nice centralized

113
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.160
mississauga you're in one of the poster
child buildings uh when you search for

114
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.199
mississauga um that's the area that
you're gonna be living in yeah which is

115
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.880
it's the gta it's not like downtown
toronto or anything like that as a

116
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.280
former toronton toronton
um you just say toronto brampton

117
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.720
scarborough mississauga it's all toronto
like i i very much kind of

118
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.000
obviously you know like i've i have a
very compartmentalized idea that like

119
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.879
toronto is just like
downtown yeah and then every all the

120
00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.400
suburbs and everything they don't ex
they're not toronto and that's that's

121
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.120
what you that's the problem you had
early on it's like i'm only moving to

122
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.080
toronto if i can live in toronto i'm
like but james the burroughs and you're

123
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.120
like no that doesn't count it's kind of
like most people don't live in toronto

124
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.520
yeah
like there's a million people in

125
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.360
mississauga
which is more than the entire province

126
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.440
of nova scotia yeah
uh like it's not an absolute

127
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.520
unsubstantial city um
by the way the air conditioner will be

128
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.360
turning on and off throughout the
recording i apologize for that the new

129
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.990
building has central air so we won't
have to worry about that

130
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.200
[Music]
i i don't think people in on the discord

131
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.640
or
i was gonna say in chat uh like people

132
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.000
friends of the chat of the channel don't
really know this but i actually was

133
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.080
spent in the first seven years of my
life in toronto i lived there for the

134
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.680
first seven years of my life yeah so and
i lived in scarborough which is on on

135
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.480
the opposite side of toronto which is
yeah it's on the eastern side inside

136
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.000
mississauga is on the western side yeah
um

137
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.480
so that's what's going on uh big
exciting things so basically

138
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.800

you know i'm going to be

157
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.519
have to go to ikea and buy some new
furniture because we're not taking

158
00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:28.320
certain stuff with us

159
00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:32.880
things like that it's going to be
hectic as hell which is why

160
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.600
i'm on a mission right now to get the
attack on titan video completed and out

161
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.440
for the first of september yeah like
that's going out while i'm on the plane

162
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.160
yeah um
and then

163
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.800
the um

164
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:53.250
and then i want three other videos
written

165
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.839
[Music]
before we leave

166
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:58.959
yeah
which we have a concept for what we're

167
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.160
going to talk about those on this
podcast because we have multiple

168
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.000
concepts yeah we just wanted to sound
off in the comments by the way which

169
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.600
ones you would like to see most so we
have the attack on titan that's coming

170
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.440
up for september we james and i want to
make a discussion well specifically me i

171
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.839
kind of spearheaded this one i wanted to
talk about the rise the the renaissance

172
00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:21.519
of the queer villain yeah um and that
kind of i kind of got the inspiration

173
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.320
because i wanted to make a video about
everything everywhere all at once since

174
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.959
i watched it because it's just really
fantastic

175
00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:31.440
um and it wasn't until
um

176
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.959
sarah
the star trek girl

177
00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:42.320
this video is star trek
drawing jesse jessie gender oh my god i

178
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.680
was getting confused with sarah z
sarah's ed um

179
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.079
different different persons yes very
different person um i'm not great with

180
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:54.639
names good with faces not with names
but uh and then the discussion about how

181
00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:58.000
there is a trend there was a one-off
trans villain on a star trek episode

182
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.279
yeah uh and you know the concept of
queer villains being able to be villains

183
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:07.360
for reasons unrelated to their queerness
yeah um like you know like you had the

184
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.480
star trek villain she was just
an amazingly fabulous badass like

185
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.920
um
she's played by the actress who uh i

186
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.600
forgot the characters name now she was
in the new queers folk and she was my

187
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.399
favorite character
and

188
00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:25.680
because she was just such a
like

189
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.360
awesome yeah like she'd just gotten a
kid and she's like oh god i hate this

190
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.320
kid what was the the fake the um the the
villain's name on everything everywhere

191
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.839
not the actual name i can't remember i
only watched it i'm sorry i can't

192
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:42.399
remember yeah but like that was just a
really well actualized villain who was

193
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:46.240
queer but not a villain because she was
queer yeah and i want to talk about like

194
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.079
are we sort of make a video discussing
are we in a position and culture where

195
00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:54.399
we are able to be
super competent villains once again yeah

196
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.600
where we can have queer villains without
it being demonizing queer people yeah

197
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.920
yeah um and i'm really excited for that
because i love villains yeah um they're

198
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.160
always so fantastic not always but you
know they can be they can villains are

199
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.600
usually the best characters a good
villain mate a villain makes or breaks

200
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.839
um
without a good villain you can't have a

201
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:16.160
good hero oh yeah that's absolutely true
yeah um

202
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.639
so i am really really excited to make
that um like luke skywalker would just

203
00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:24.000
be a whiny [ __ ] if it weren't for darth
vader oh absolutely um and that's love

204
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.399
you mark hamill
but

205
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:29.200
that's probably the reason why until
episode eight when he's not a whiny

206
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.000
[ __ ] and then everybody hates him yeah
well and that's part of the reason why

207
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.200
star wars gets remembered whereas other
sort of space operas of the era don't um

208
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.079
not necessarily there's a lot of like
things trying to be star wars too yeah

209
00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:46.480
but the thing is you you need the
villain you need the mannerisms of david

210
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.440
prowse
yes he was the body for darth vader you

211
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.040
need his mannerisms because he actually
he didn't know that he wasn't going to

212
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.560
be the followers at first no but in the
other two he did he was so salty about

213
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.959
it he spoiled episode
six yeah

214
00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:06.959
um and he just did a really good job of
body acting and james earl jones was a

215
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:11.360
fantastic voice and
uh they just darth vader functions so

216
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.480
well as a villain so there's a lot to
talk about with villains because we're

217
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.320
also going oh we could also kind of
reprise a discussion about hannibal like

218
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.399
you know like hannibal lecter being a
certainly queer coded villain especially

219
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:26.880
in the books
yeah um we're also so that's going to be

220
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.320
a
hopefully a september video and then

221
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.440
we've got two planned for october
uh well there's multiple up in the air

222
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.399
so again sound off in the comments and
let us know which ones you think sound

223
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:43.360
the best um a sort of dissection of
queer perfection yeah and how queer

224
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.639
people feel like they need to be perfect
by going through black swan yeah because

225
00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.839
i i'm obsessed with black swan it's one
of my favorite movies anytime i'm kind

226
00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:53.680
of like focusing on like good or kind of
trying to talk about what i think is

227
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.360
good writing i usually default to black
swan and that will also give me a reason

228
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.000
to use more footage from the gay version
of swan lake in a video

229
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.040
um doing justice for the world yeah
retroactive justice for a bunch of hot

230
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.279
male ballerinas dancing around
um

231
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:15.440
by the way if you're a male ballerina
and you live in the toronto area i would

232
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.160
love to date you

233
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.440
but
um

234
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.040
you know if you want to date a
small-scale youtuber

235
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.399
um
there's a there's a ballet in toronto

236
00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:31.440
you never know yeah there is actually
there's a lot of culture in toronto oh

237
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.440
like there's a lot of culture in toronto
what i mean my culture is there there is

238
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.880
a lot of like artistic stuff like
there's a very large conservatory in um

239
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.040
toronto i could i could hypothetically
start going to see operas again i'd love

240
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.399
to go see operas oh they are so
fantastic it's like

241
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:51.440
when you're operas are a lot like
broadway in the sense that you know you

242
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.240
listen to the track isolated and it
takes a certain year for it but like

243
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.639
when you're in that seat like it's
everywhere well yeah the suspension of

244
00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:02.000
disbelief just goes away yeah because
like the way they sing isn't just to

245
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.839
kind of project to the back of the room
it fills the room yeah it's such an

246
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:10.000
interesting experience um
if you can find yourself making your way

247
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.519
to an opera i strongly recommend it
um

248
00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.680
but yeah um so i'm excited to write that
so there's the queer villains

249
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.680
um there's the queer perfection via
black swan

250
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.920
um then there's
the official october video because the

251
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.600
october videos always have something to
do with horror yeah and that's been true

252
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.120
since before the channel became a thing
well yeah that was monsters in the

253
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.720
closet deep cuts
uh what did we call the hannibal one

254
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.959
uh fear coded fear coded i really like
that title actually yeah

255
00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:47.839
um
and then there's that and then there's

256
00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.240
um
shudder

257
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.720
stealing my idea of doing documentaries
about queer horror but i'm not salty

258
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.560
um
and so this time we're going to do

259
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.639
monsters out of the closet and we're
going to talk about how

260
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.559
horror
has

261
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.919
begun
started the process of being openly

262
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:12.799
queer yeah kind of using chucky the tv
show chucky to kind of use that and the

263
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:17.360
upcoming hell right here to the upcoming
hellraiser yes which i am very happy is

264
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.000
going to be
a hard r

265
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.079
they're not going to go for any kind of
pg nonsense people were talking that it

266
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.480
should be pg-13 to have a wider audience
and i'm like have you seen hellraiser do

267
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.919
you know the concept of hellraiser yeah
yeah that's not a pg-13 concept no you

268
00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:38.400
need to change it significantly to make
it a pg-13 concept like

269
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.840
go away
go away hello raiser has been drug

270
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.880
through the mud so much
ever since we've had deadpool and joker

271
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.280
and uh it chapter one joker made a
billion dollars demonstrated that

272
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.679
r-rated movies
can be big box office draws yeah i still

273
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.679
want my ra to batman movie i know it's
like borderline edge lord but i want it

274
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.200
right about honestly like when it comes
to batman

275
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.559
like the batman i think
that's as hard as you can go into like

276
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:11.919
our territory without getting into frank
miller

277
00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:16.559
no i don't want batman like i want the
villains to be the rated r part like i

278
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:22.000
want it to be like seven
okay honestly like seven gets like kind

279
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.360
of praised as one of these like you know
amazing psychological thrillers i didn't

280
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.679
really find it that like
you have no taste no like i watched it i

281
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:33.600
liked it but i'm like yeah this this is
good it's the only movie i've ever found

282
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.320
brad pitt sexy
not uh once upon a time in hollywood no

283
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.440
really no but he was on a roof with no
shirt yeah i know

284
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.320
damn it
okay

285
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.600
it's like how interview with the vampire
is the only movie i've ever found tom

286
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.360
cruise sexy okay so brad pitt has been
in a movie called once upon a time in

287
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.320
hollywood he's in a movie called seven
and he's also been in 13 monkeys are

288
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.200
there any brad pitt
he also produced 12 years a slave he did

289
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.120
i wonder if we can go from one to seven
or one to 13

290
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.080
with brad pitt
that would be an interesting film

291
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.919
festival
brad pitt if you're a patron you should

292
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:16.240
do that
just

293
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.580
like put it together with talia
call it 13 degrees of brad pitt

294
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.840
[Laughter]

295
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.919
but yeah um
so there's that one and then there was

296
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:34.720
an there's also the weight of being gay
which i've started writing again have

297
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.520
you because you put it you started
writing it and then you got disappointed

298
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.799
so have you picked it up again no but
it's you know a portion of it is written

299
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:45.120
okay okay um
which is really kind of getting into the

300
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.720
ideas of body image within the gay male
community and especially like you know

301
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.480
like uh concepts of health and body
weight in general yeah and how there is

302
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.799
a big difference between being healthy
and having you know the quote-unquote

303
00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:00.880
sexy body for me like it's a it's a big
dichotomy of like you know like a lot of

304
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.679
health problems are blamed on weight on
blame on body size you know like oh

305
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:09.360
you're having chronic pain it's probably
body body weight you're not doing x

306
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.000
properly it's probably because your body
without realizing that especially this

307
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.840
factors into your condition is that body
size

308
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.120
is can be a symptom not a cause yeah
like with me i i have a condition that

309
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.039
makes me basically allergic to
carbohydrates which i've paid the price

310
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.360
for today
um

311
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.720
and when i decided to cut carbs out and
go on a borderline keto diet i lost 15

312
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.200
pounds rather quickly yeah i have not
lost any more but i haven't gained it

313
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.720
back we haven't you we haven't lost
anymore you haven't lost anymore because

314
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.480
you know we have been under a lot of
pressure and we haven't break it we have

315
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.159
been bending rules uh we've just been
i've been breaking the rules i ate

316
00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:52.320
mcdonald's tonight yeah like i ate pasta
the other night like i am not following

317
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.679
the rules
and it's so funny because like i never

318
00:20:55.679 --> 00:21:00.840
quite realized before just how much my
body hated me after i would eat

319
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.799
pasta and then punished me for it when
you went on a carb cleanse you cleared

320
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:09.360
up like you felt you had more energy uh
you were more motivated

321
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.400
your pimples went away you were more
motivated yeah

322
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.640
and then you know carbs have been
reintroduced and my body is like i hate

323
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.159
it's because like carbs are so are kind
of like the cornerstone of all diamonds

324
00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:26.480
cuisine food so it's an incredibly
difficult task to make food that

325
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.840
eliminates carbohydrates yeah and like
the

326
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.559
substitutes are very hit and miss
uh like one of the things that i've

327
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:39.360
discovered is that there are a lot of
sweets that are carb free or very low in

328
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.200
carbs but that is because they replace
sugar with maltitol which

329
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.320
if you know what maltitol is
it is a great sugar replacement and

330
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.919
about an hour later
it feels like you've just eaten 20

331
00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:58.559
pounds of x-lax well i mean like
the the x-lax diet was endorsed by louis

332
00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:02.799
armstrong so that worked out great i
mean didn't didn't it he lived a long

333
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:06.159
life
yeah but he died eventually everyone

334
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:10.840
dies eventually james he was born in
like the 30s oh my

335
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.600
god no actually like
x-lax diets do have health health do

336
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.760
come with health problems
dehydration being the biggest one

337
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.400
you drink a lot of water anyway i need
to drink more water i don't drink nearly

338
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.120
as much water as you think i only drink
like a bottle a day

339
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.840
like a big bottle like one of your big
chunks yeah it's a big chunker but i

340
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.240
mean that's a lot of water like
technically you only really need to

341
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.720
drink when you're thirsty the problem
with me is that i'm so anxious i need to

342
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.720
keep myself distracted so i don't
realize i'm thirsty

343
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:43.760
um we're always thirsty
so like those are the kind of four

344
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.799
concrete videos we have planned
including the um way of being gay as

345
00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:54.400
well as a the 50 the ranked 50 games oh
yeah that's something that i was going

346
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.840
to do last week but then i ended up
getting a sore throat again yeah and

347
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.799
um i'm basically waiting for
an evening where it's

348
00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:09.600
not crazy humid and crazy hot where i
can turn the air conditioner off and i

349
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.880
can actually sit down and do it i have
the ranking system set up i'm going to

350
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.840
rank them on the fly and then edit it
together

351
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.840
like afterwards um
because i don't i don't think there's

352
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.559
like writing a script for that i think
would just be silly i'm just going to

353
00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:29.440
like riff on it there's some movies that
i know are going to go in the homophobic

354
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.960
slate there's there's um another i i'm
still open to doing the notes on notes

355
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.640
on camp in that format
yeah kind of just the riffing format

356
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.080
because i want that to be a patreon
exclusive because yeah it was promised

357
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.039
and we kind of dropped it when
everything

358
00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:49.440
happened uh everything went crazy
everything did go crazy

359
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.080
um so i still would like to do that
because that seems like a fun because i

360
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.480
could read through that again and just
read her for filth um nick visited home

361
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.039
for the first time in three years and
then everything went nuts everything did

362
00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:05.279
go nuts
um and it all started when i almost

363
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:11.200
broke my neck in the shower yes
on my second day there

364
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.520
yeah it's great it's great
well no we got a shot in the arm we are

365
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.679
going to toronto you're getting
you're you actually put out applications

366
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:25.600
for actors in the gta yeah i put out an
ad because there's been no pickup in the

367
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:32.080
halifax area
about a dozen in halifax yeah and so far

368
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.080
i've gotten a and i put it out yesterday
i've gotten about 50. yeah actual

369
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.720
applicants from people and applicants
who have like been on actual shows

370
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.400
yeah um
and you know they're sending

371
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.360
you know professional headshots and
everything it's like these people are

372
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.039
like i want to be an actor
and i'm like

373
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:58.400
yeah can we we can do this yeah so like
i'm trying to figure out a movie now i'm

374
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.799
working on it kind of like a modern day
adaptation of rope if anyone has seen

375
00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:05.520
rope i talk about it and monsters in the
closet

376
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.600
um
kind of a modern-day version of that and

377
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.640
i'm trying to figure out a way to
basically make it so that it can be shot

378
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.360
in my new apartment so that it can be
shot during the winter and we won't have

379
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.720
to deal with snow or anything like that
locations or anything yeah maybe i

380
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.320
should watch rope before this but like
an idea crosses my mind for like the

381
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.400
dynamic between the two of them well
rope is very vague i mean like you know

382
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.520
like it's obvious like you want to make
it obvious you barely even see the body

383
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.799
in rope yeah you want to make it obvious
that they're queer though that they're

384
00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:38.000
kind of oh yeah those two are they're
murder boyfriends they're boyfriends but

385
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.760
like did you know that alex and steve
from minecraft are boyfriends

386
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.080
canonically i thought steve was a girl
no i thought alex was a girl no they're

387
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.080
boyfriends canonically no way yeah okay
i like alex femboy

388
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.279
um
so like

389
00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:58.240
so they're obvious they're murder
boyfriends and they have a body hidden

390
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.080
in the apartment you said maybe during a
christmas party a christmas party a new

391
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.960
year's party or something like that um
throughout the duration um

392
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.520
big
big boy a murder boy murder boyfriend a

393
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.760
hannibal um is basically kind of um
hannibal and will we'll just call them

394
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.080
hannibal and will foreign reassuring
um

395
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.159
uh boyfriend b so
boyfriend b that like every like you

396
00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:28.240
know kind of sort of in a very playful
kind of like jabbing sort of like you

397
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.559
killed someone ha ha or like you know
there's a body there ha ha ha ha ha

398
00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:35.520
and then like at the end of the movie
you learned that

399
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.360
it's actually boyfriend b who does the
murdering and boyfriend a is just

400
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.799
supportive
and like the joking and jabbing is

401
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:46.799
actually part of their like ritual
that's an interesting twist yeah um like

402
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:50.320
the one you're the one that you think is
trapped in this relationship with a

403
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.640
murderer um is actually the murderer
themself and then the the other one is

404
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.640
just supportive of their murder habits
yeah that'd be interesting

405
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.039
um
but yeah i'm thinking of doing that as

406
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:06.640
the first because final girl needs to be
shot in the woods and that's a summer

407
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.919
needs to be shot in the summertime or
the spring yeah which we can probably

408
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:14.000
because of the way weather hits in in
ontario we can probably shoot that in

409
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.960
like april yeah and have it out in the
summer time so telos will start moving

410
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.000
um like as soon as we relocate i am you
know gonna be getting in touch with the

411
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.720
actors figuring out a way to
interview them um

412
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.000
because we had a we had a space to
interview them here i'm sure there's a

413
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.039
space like that in toronto um
but yeah so there's a bunch of stuff

414
00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:39.679
planned
um

415
00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:44.240
the big
i mean the big headache for me was

416
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.640
draining my savings for that big giant
upfront payment but because it was

417
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.320
basically buying a car yeah yeah but
you're knowing the fact that you're not

418
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.000
going to have to pay rent and that new
place for an entire year yeah like you

419
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.840
know you get to put money away there
yeah so that you know takes off a lot of

420
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.720
pressure and then just hopefully the
landlord doesn't say they want it all up

421
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.120
front again next year like i'm
like like i said i lived in this video

422
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.440
was supposed to be talking about
upcoming videos but like i'm kind of

423
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.320
just using waxing nostalgia this is just
a life update about toronto like i cuz i

424
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.440
lived in scarborough and the scarborough
bluffs are gorgeous um gorgeous

425
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.919
gorgeous gorgeous and i'm just very
excited to sort of rediscover toronto

426
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:27.520
because that's kind of the culture that
i was raised and then ripped out of to

427
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.279
move into the styx where i was the
locust fish in the village unfortunately

428
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:35.440
um the locust fish the wokest fish oh
yeah

429
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.960
it's it's weird being in a small town
and like being socially aware but having

430
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.880
no one to challenge your preconceptions
so you don't have any excuse or kind of

431
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.200
cause to grow or change or evolve yeah
you know

432
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.600
which is why you're such a pain in the
ass now i am a little bit okay i guess

433
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.679
uh james we can't say this because there
might be five people that misconstrue

434
00:28:55.679 --> 00:29:00.480
this messaging and then cancel you
yeah the attack on titan video i'm going

435
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.200
through the i'm i'm trying to be very
balanced yeah with that because i don't

436
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.200
want to say the people who hate attack
on titan are dumb

437
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.799
um
but as it is my favorite anime i kind of

438
00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:17.200
want to be like well my like it's my
favorite anime series i kind of think of

439
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.679
yuri on ice as like a mini series yeah
whereas attack on titan is the only on

440
00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:27.679
is my favorite ongoing anime
uh though skate season two is coming um

441
00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:32.880
but um banana fish season two when
yeah

442
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.399
when i make the movie
and i will make the movie and i will

443
00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:40.880
make ash more relatable
like like we were talking about this the

444
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.320
other day like i would like i famously
really did not like banana fashion those

445
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.159
who are in the know know how much i
didn't i really didn't like it yeah nick

446
00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:54.320
really disliked attack on titan yeah
like other than the first arc of season

447
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.880
three
i don't think you had a nice thing to

448
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.559
say about the show i have no i did gobby
i liked i liked god everybody hates it

449
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:05.279
yeah and that's the thing like
everything that the attack on titan

450
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:08.799
fandom hates about the series i was like
yeah that was actually well done yeah

451
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:12.320
like i think the gobby story story line
was also really well done like of course

452
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.640
i didn't like her but like i was like
you understood her by the progress

453
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.559
i liked how her character arc functioned
yeah but like it was a pain for you to

454
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:25.760
get through attack on time you couldn't
get through an episode of banana fish

455
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.080
paid to watch banana fish
and i do pay you to watch banana fish

456
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.320
but like i was saying like in order for
to fix banana fish in a way that i would

457
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.120
appreciate
edgy would need to be split up into

458
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.200
three characters
no ash okay you would have needed the

459
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.520
you know very edgy is perfect and leave
them alone edgy is a balanced character

460
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.559
i appreciated that you would have needed
the relatively non-verbal murder boy he

461
00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:58.720
would have been ash like you know the
kind of tragic

462
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.399
abused um but very resilient and tough
as nails figure who was ash

463
00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:08.559
um and he's very physical that's his
thing he he he's he's he's a murderer

464
00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:11.039
he's a
he's an attack dog you point and he

465
00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.760
attacks
there would have been the super smart

466
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.679
eloquent educated one who does spend his
time at the library yeah um and there

467
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:21.600
would have been the charismatic leader
yeah so the three of them would have

468
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.200
been balanced characters yeah that's
what i think

469
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.960
um
but yeah you could not get through

470
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.320
banana fish at all but yeah so attack
contact

471
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.200
the note it rolled up into the little
bill caps

472
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.200
but attack on titan is
easily my favorite ongoing anime manga

473
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.840
like series thing like i'm i haven't
been exposed to a whole lot but like

474
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.679
that's my favorite as of now
and so i've been like vehemently

475
00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:56.480
defending it like on twitter and stuff
against some people who are very like

476
00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.640
they're normal people like they're
saying like i'm uncomfortable with x and

477
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.159
stuff like that and then other ones who
are like well it's fascistic and if you

478
00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:07.760
like it you're a fascist and it's like
the thing is like going through it i do

479
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.320
see where the discomfort can come from
oh absolutely um but i also don't

480
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.799
necessarily feel that it's brazenly
endorsing fascism yeah in fact in the

481
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:20.000
video i'm like in our discussions
leading up to the video i'm like i don't

482
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.559
know if this is actually saying anything
about fascism yeah because just because

483
00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:29.519
it's using a
a fascist imagery and using images

484
00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:33.840
imagery from fascist fascistic um
discrimination like with the ghettos and

485
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.640
the armbands
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's

486
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.600
making a commentary about fascism itself
yeah um it's just borrowing these pieces

487
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.039
of imagery to set the scene so that the
viewer can identify with the systems of

488
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:50.960
oppression that are going on yeah and
that's where i think that attack on

489
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.480
titan is
resting on this on this topic yeah i

490
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.200
think that it's very because i noticed
that what going through it the show

491
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.440
doesn't really lack for subtlety
uh no the show doesn't lack the does joe

492
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.120
doesn't like subtlety
um it's like it doesn't last there's a

493
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.000
lot of
uh this discourse in the series um about

494
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
trauma grief duplicity yeah um
consumption victimization

495
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.600
um and
the show is absolutely not shy to have

496
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.720
main characters basically look directly
at the camera and say this is what's

497
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.440
going on right now yeah um so i'm like
if there was something deeper to this

498
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.640
about an opinion about fascism
it would have been discussed yeah and

499
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.080
that's kind of where i'm at about attack
on titan yeah

500
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.480
but you know we'll get into much more
detail on that in the actual video to

501
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.120
come
um don't give me a minute i will talk

502
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.720
about the earned rally literary house
where i have a costume

503
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.480
um costume i have a costume they're
going to be outfit changes i don't know

504
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.840
where it's going to be shot but yeah
there's a costume um

505
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.440
so yeah there's a lot going on there's a
lot going on with youtube there's a lot

506
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.799
going on with moving there's a lot going
on with telos

507
00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:06.080
all these pieces that have been well
youtube there's always a lot going on

508
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.520
with youtube but these extra pieces with
the moving and the telos that have been

509
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.879
kind of stagnant
for a long time

510
00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:17.919
um
they got a shot in the arm

511
00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:21.119
yeah they just got their booster shot
and now they're ready to go back out

512
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:26.800
into the playground and
i'm like hold on i don't have your leash

513
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.720
like i'm
kind of losing control

514
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.560
over covent times like
well yeah it's like because i'm getting

515
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.919
like 20 emails a day
from

516
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:42.000
moving companies and power companies and
internet companies and

517
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.879
do you have for the building i forgot to
ask like is are utilities included

518
00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:51.919
um electricity isn't it electricity
isn't but everything else is really

519
00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:57.839
that strikes me as odd that's okay yeah
the hydro or whatever is you pay for

520
00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:01.440
that separately
um that's weird apparently it's like 40

521
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.920
bucks a month
um

522
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.200
yeah
um so i'm just constantly getting emails

523
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.640
about that and then
especially because you won't have an air

524
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.800
conditioner blasting through the summer
well yeah because it's just the central

525
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.010
layer
um

526
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.200
[Music]
and i probably won't never have the heat

527
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.720
on in the winter because i'm
like that

528
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.640
i would rather walk around with socks
and a sweater on than have the heat on

529
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.119
um
but yeah there's so much going on

530
00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:34.079
and
i'm sorry this podcast didn't have like

531
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.960
a proper
point topic

532
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.240
or anything like that
um

533
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.119
i'm also thinking it's probably gonna be
a short one um

534
00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:47.760
otherwise we're just gonna repeat
ourselves yeah like this is just kind of

535
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.200
uh get you up to speed i'm actually
really excited for the black swan video

536
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.160
because
that's one that i feel very deeply yeah

537
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.720
um because you you see me all the time i
will rip my nails out for

538
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.119
that perfect
presentation of stuff

539
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:07.040
what you'll rip your nails out figure a
speech okay i'll torture myself

540
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.280
figuratively i will torture myself in
order to basically make something

541
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.320
picture-perfect yeah and you've seen
that with like the way i write videos

542
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.839
and like the amount of time i spend on
detailing like you know like including

543
00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:22.720
research and kind of taking these videos
into weird twisting tangents and places

544
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.839
to kind of just make these really weird
connections and then just put way more

545
00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:30.480
work on myself than i need to yeah
um

546
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.720
and how like i feel partly that i need
to do that because i do not have any

547
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.400
desire to procreate so what else am i
gonna offer the world right

548
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.680
like right well i don't know i think the
greatest gift to humanity right now is

549
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.839
people not having children
right

550
00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.920
um
all those goddamn landlords who are like

551
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.079
we'd much rather rent to a family anyway
and so no we don't really know what's

552
00:36:56.079 --> 00:37:01.040
going on for the december video though
or november really or right yeah i

553
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.240
november is that month of the year that
i always forget about

554
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.640
i mean december is i think december
might be the anime month that might be

555
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.359
what the [ __ ] happens in november
literally ever what happens in november

556
00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:16.640
american thanksgiving
that doesn't count

557
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.400
black friday
also does not count like what is

558
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:26.000
november used for november has no pretty
leaves november has no snow it's just

559
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.560
this weird november used to have snow
when i was a kid it snowed in november

560
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:36.320
december doesn't even happen no
it doesn't oh gosh global warming but

561
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.079
yeah i think december is actually going
to be the anime month because i think

562
00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:43.520
that's when we're going to do the given
video and we're going to do the number

563
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.240
six video number six
oh my god is it number six number eight

564
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.800
i think number six yeah number six times
sounds familiar i think it's number six

565
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.560
i haven't read this yet but would there
be a video in demon's lair

566
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.560
um
[Music]

567
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.599
i have it on my on my um on my bedside
table but there might be

568
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:06.240
i
don't already didn't let you know no

569
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.040
i've been wanting to pick it up i've
been wanting to pick it up

570
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.359
well by all means you know check it out
um i like the i like the look of the guy

571
00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:18.720
who has the pig face the pig yeah he was
so pretty under the pig head i that

572
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.720
that's one of my favorite tropes is
incredibly small pretty boys who are

573
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.400
completely feral and he's like he's he's
he has major luca energy really a

574
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.680
character oh that makes me happy he's
like i am small and i need to kill

575
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.760
things i i i do need some luca
inspiration so that might be my shot in

576
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.320
the arm yeah he's a really fun character
um

577
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.119
i haven't watched the anime though
because i seriously do the voice the

578
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:46.720
english voice actors small pretty boy
ghost farrell is like my favorite trope

579
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.920
of all time
um but yeah for november i'm sure you

580
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.040
know there will be videos for november
uh we have we still have a stack of

581
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.359
videos that we just haven't done yet
i mean like strange world is coming out

582
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:04.480
when november
okay

583
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.640
hey now i mean that would kind of be
like a heart stopper type thing

584
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.440
um where i would basically watch it
thursday night and then have the video

585
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.400
out for sunday so weird that
strange world is getting no traction

586
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.480
that disney's not promoting it girl
there are so many people watching the

587
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.320
owl house video
saying oh my god i have never heard of

588
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.040
this before i'm so excited there are so
many people watching the owl house video

589
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.359
who are like i barely watch anything but
cartoon network and nickelodeon and i

590
00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:40.000
have never heard of the owl house
that makes me want to cry but yeah like

591
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
strange world like it's getting no media
push from nothing nothing but if you

592
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.720
want wha i recommend it watch a trailer
it looks really really really really

593
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.720
good it's fun because disney's like fun
it looks vibrant the animation looks

594
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.560
incredible you've got a queer character
of color like but the thing that i think

595
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.680
disney's kind of
marketing brain is saying about it is

596
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.000
it's coming out the same month as black
panther two yeah so why bother yeah we

597
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.040
don't need the money
and so they're just gonna throw it under

598
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.560
the bus but it looks like such it looks
like a new wave classic disney movie

599
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.319
like that kind of looked like zootopia
wreck-it ralph like it looks like it

600
00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:23.280
fits into that ufra very very well fun
it does look very very fun i'm actually

601
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.520
sad that disney's making it and that i'm
sad that i'm mad at disney for making it

602
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.880
because it does look really really fun
yeah like i am absolutely going to see

603
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.960
it opening weekend
um preview night you know like thursday

604
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.240
night if it's in imax i'll go to imax
like i will give it all of the money

605
00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.040
that i can
um

606
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.760
because i want it to be a success to
spike disney honestly like i'd love to

607
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.119
stump it to specifically by disney like
kind of promote it and do what i can to

608
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:52.480
push it like yeah like i i might just
make a video like if i watch it and it's

609
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.560
good i might just make a video promoting
it yeah honestly saying like everybody

610
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.599
go watch look does disney do it right
and they want to sweep it up and they

611
00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:02.960
want you not to know about it yeah
disney doesn't want you to the disney

612
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.720
movie they don't want you to see
actually that's a good title yeah um

613
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.000
well that could apply for several disney
movies that already exist well yeah but

614
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.480
like i really don't want you to see song
of the song that's sort of what i was

615
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.640
gonna mention like why is this movie
which seems unremarkable as far as

616
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.520
disney animation is concerned and
animation excellence is concerned except

617
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.560
for that it has it is promoting a
ensemble cast focused around a queer

618
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.920
teenager and it's not like it's nobody's
in the case

619
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.640
yeah yeah why is this in the leagues of
movies that disney does not want you to

620
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.440
watch like song of the south what puts
this in that camp yeah it's it's the

621
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.640
gates or like the black cauldron and
stuff which the black cauldron is

622
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.440
actually a really fun movie the black
cauldron is a really fun movie but it is

623
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.200
dark it is it is very dark i i
appreciate its darkness though that was

624
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.480
back when that was back when tim burton
still had his umph

625
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.480
he was an animator on the movie oh he
was an animator on it yeah um he

626
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.720
actually got his start doing work for
fox and the hounds but he almost got

627
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.800
fired from that job because
his um illustrations apparently looked

628
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.800
like uh quote roadkill
wow um

629
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.119
well no one's run over in that like if
if you've ever read his uh what's his

630
00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:17.119
book of poems called
i don't know they are all fantastic i

631
00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:19.680
recommend looking at tim burton's poetry
book

632
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.240
that's back when he still had his you
know like

633
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.839
gusto and they're just so
what match boy

634
00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:31.760
something i can't remember i'm sure if
you like amazon tim burton it will come

635
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.839
up
they were so great i loved them all um

636
00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:39.440
but yeah so that they'll probably be a
video about that in november like kind

637
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.200
of a reactionary video like there was
with heart stopper or um uh fantastic

638
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.520
beasts yeah not not young royals because
that was much after it was probably yeah

639
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.240
um
kind of just like a quick video

640
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.440
so we'll see what happens there i'm sure
there'll be something else in november

641
00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.839
too um like i said there's a glut of
videos

642
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:07.359
and i are very rarely wanting for ideas
yeah um like even if we don't have

643
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:10.400
anything slated like sometimes we'll do
we do have something slated and you'll

644
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.960
be like we need to make a video about
this right now and then that'll

645
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.319
completely mess up the schedule well
like stranger things yeah yeah like that

646
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:20.240
that move that video was not supposed to
be made yeah the video that it was

647
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.119
supposed to be attack on titan was
supposed to come next yeah and

648
00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:28.400
then i was like
stranger things season four is really

649
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.480
good
we should do a video about it because

650
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.000
you know the will gay stuff and robin
and then we didn't talk about any of

651
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.240
that but it ended up being a really good
video and the views are decent so you

652
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.359
you asked how one time you when i was
talking about how much i didn't like

653
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:47.760
attack on titan you're like you never
like any media that i recommend to you i

654
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.960
really like stranger things okay that's
another example of something that i

655
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:57.119
really really like okay the exception to
the rule no no it's about 50 50 james

656
00:43:57.119 --> 00:44:00.240
there is no rule
sometimes i like things sometimes i

657
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.280
don't
sometimes you like it anyway

658
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.960
i'm sure that if i i'm discovering my
own media there will be stuff that you

659
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.920
won't like
most of it i am i'm sure yeah um

660
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.119
still trying to get you to play certain
video games that i really really liked

661
00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:20.960
it but honestly for me with video games
there's video games i'm super excited to

662
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.200
play that i have on my playstation and i
just don't play yeah

663
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.680
you got the guardians game i really want
to play that apparently it was a lot of

664
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.839
fun yeah um
when i sit down at the playstation i'm

665
00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:37.359
like i'm gonna you know open up kakarot
and play it or i'm gonna open up um

666
00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:40.880
horizon forbidden west and you're just
like playing some warframe and warframe

667
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.560
or overwatch i'm just like because i
just want to turn my brain on i kind of

668
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.319
get that with me in writing because like
i i've kind of been taking a hiatus from

669
00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:52.400
writing while everything has been going
on because sitting down to start writing

670
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.520
always writing fiction fiction yeah
and non-fiction but to a greater extent

671
00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.560
a fiction because i have a lot of hang
up like um

672
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.800
self-confidence hang-ups about my
fiction work right now yeah so sitting

673
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.599
down to write feels like much of a chore
then it actually ends up being yeah like

674
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:14.400
i'll start writing and i'll just go
um

675
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.720
i'm really hoping that i can get another
book out soon yeah because the one that

676
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.960
i have been working on that's almost
finished yeah um

677
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.760
just kind of came out of nowhere i
started writing it as a sort of you know

678
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.280
free associate association exercise and
it just kind of materialized so i'm

679
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.880
really happy about that
um and then on to work on avalon night

680
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.760
two yeah
and then next year we are going to put

681
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.359
out unrequited
um oh yeah yeah yeah because publisher

682
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:42.640
wanted to do it and then publisher
didn't want to and kind of

683
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.200
gas let us a little bit
um well that didn't gas lightest but the

684
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.880
the the editor we were working with was
wonderful but then the publisher decided

685
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.640
not to go forward but i want to publish
the book so

686
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.240
you know we're going to self-publish it
it's going to have more essays and stuff

687
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.480
in it so that's something to look
forward to

688
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.400
um
[Music]

689
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.720
but yeah we're crazy busy right now
which is why especially this week with

690
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.560
the writing and the
finding out about everything so that's

691
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.000
why the podcast is so late eventually we
will get back to putting them out on

692
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.920
mondays yeah um and i won tuesdays we
always put them on tuesdays it was

693
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.599
monday at first and then it was tuesday
and then it was wednesday and now it's

694
00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:24.079
thursday

695
00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:29.599
so eventually do like eight days to make
a podcast and like procedurally just get

696
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:32.720
on the list
um like i also wanted to do that

697
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.880
serialized writing project
serialized writing project like the the

698
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.960
thing that i add like a chapter two
every week or so oh yeah yeah and i also

699
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.079
wanted to become a photographer so i
have a lot of my plate maybe i should

700
00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:48.800
start taking things off my plate
i think you just need to organize

701
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.000
organize better yeah you know time
management

702
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.240
take a time management class
because they work do they have those

703
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.680
i've i was forced to take them in
business school

704
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.960
um i was thinking for me mainly like
time management for work-life balance

705
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.079
but oh i have to sneeze give me a second
talk about something talk talk about
