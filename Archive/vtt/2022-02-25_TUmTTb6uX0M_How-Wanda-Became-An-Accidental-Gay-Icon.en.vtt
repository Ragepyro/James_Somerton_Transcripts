00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.310
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.141
Before we get started with the video I just
want to thank everyone who signed up for the

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:06.460
Telos Pictures IndieGoGo campaign.

4
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:15.800
It has wildly exceeded my craziest expectations
for it and I am so excited to have the chance

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.820
to bring you guys really great narrative LGBTQ
content made by LGBTQ people for an LGBTQ

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.820
audience.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.480
If you haven't signed up yet there’s still
plenty of time and there’s a link in the

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300
description where you can do so.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
Also don't forget to like subscribe and comment
on this video.

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.650
You have no idea how much that helps the channel.

11
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.070
Especially since YouTube is not super excited
about propoting queer content.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.330
So like and subscribe.

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Comment below.

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:01:23.409
And now let’s get to the video.

15
00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.539
Ever notice that the LGBTQ community seems
to really gravitate toward Marvel’s The

16
00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:28.539
Scarlet Witch?

17
00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.539
Yeah me too.

18
00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.799
We can assume it’s because she’s a fabulous
dresser and diva supreme, but I think it goes

19
00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.069
a lot deeper than that.

20
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.219
And goes a lot further back in time than just
the birth of Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe.

21
00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.889
It goes back to the Bronze age of comics.

22
00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:47.579
Something comics, or at least western superhero
comics, are not exactly known for is subtlety

23
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.639
and nuance.

24
00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:54.090
They’re known for the BANG, SPLASH, WHAM,
not the meditative and contemplative.

25
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359
But it hasn’t always been this way.

26
00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.189
In the olden days, especially in the Bronze
Age of comics, about 1970 to 1985, comics

27
00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.569
were like long running printed soap operas.

28
00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.149
You still had all the action any kid could
want, but you also had more mature, drawn

29
00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.500
out character interactions that older readers,
who had grown up reading comics, wanted.

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.090
When it comes to the Scarlet Witch, Marvel
spent a great deal of time in the Bronze age

31
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.920
examining that character.

32
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.290
This is why, in spite of how bad the writing
could be, I have such a love of that age of

33
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.319
comics because they were driven by character.

34
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.319
Not events.

35
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.510
I find modern comics are built around characters
reacting to the plot and not being given time

36
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.510
to develop.

37
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.489
And this is an industry problem — editors
demand flashier and flashier books with an

38
00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.459
emphasis on action panels.

39
00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.180
Resulting in comic books with a fraction of
the dialogue that they used to have.

40
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.269
For instance, I can clear through a contemporary
comic book in about 5-10 minutes, depending

41
00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.319
on how I read the sparse dialogue.

42
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.099
Older comic titles take me about half an hour
to read, though.

43
00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.569
Stan Lee’s old writing style was to write
the outline of what happens in sequence, a

44
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.159
sort of plot outline, hand the outline to
Steve Ditco or Jack Kirby.

45
00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.870
And then the would illustrate the whole thing,
and then Lee would go back over it and write

46
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.790
the dialogue to fit what was going on.

47
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.860
For good measure, there’d also be a persistent
narration describing what was going on too.

48
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.430
You can skip a lot of the narrator writing
in older books for this reason and not miss

49
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.110
a beat because Ditco and Kirby were just…
that good at visual storytelling.

50
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.310
These days, and this is in no way a criticism
of individual artists, editors push for comic

51
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.930
books to have a quota of explosions per issue.

52
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.140
(I’m being sarcastic but I wouldn’t actually
be surprised.)

53
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.920
So it’s much harder to track what’s going
on in a title because there’s so much more

54
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.420
pressure to cram as much onto one page as
possible.

55
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.209
Couple that with both Marvel and DC’s apparent
limit of 6-8 issues per story arc, and Marvel’s

56
00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.770
pressure on canon-wide crossover events, and
there just isn’t really a whole lot of page

57
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.989
real-estate that can be afforded to just…
letting a moment land.

58
00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.579
Because titles that do focus on character-beats,
like — infamously — the She-Hulk run focusing

59
00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.730
on her career as a lawyer tend to get canceled
when they don’t hit Avengers Flagship title

60
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.730
sales numbers.

61
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.760
There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of
places to get slice-of-super-hero-life kinda

62
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.849
stuff.

63
00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.260
Everything is crisis-this, infinity-that.

64
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.930
Honestly some of my favorite vintage avengers
titles were the ones where there was no villain,

65
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.209
no fights.

66
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.880
Just these couple of friends hanging out in
Avengers Mansion doing crosswords.

67
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.289
And this is where you could get all that subtext
about the Scarlet Witch because sometimes

68
00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.110
half of an issue was just being a psychic
fly on the wall looking at drama going on

69
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.350
in Avengers Mansion.

70
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.540
So you could have The Vision and The Scarlet
Witch having a whole conversation for pages

71
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.980
at a time.

72
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.229
Comic books, classically, were also more comfortable
having storylines drawn out over many years,

73
00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.100
with writers being attached to titles for
just as long.

74
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.780
Which allowed creators to establish and develop
characters by using repetition of patterns,

75
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.950
rather than one-off mentions in a panel of
a crossover title.

76
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.260
You could never have a storyline like the
Xmen’s Phoenix and Dark Phoenix sagas today.

77
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.621
The long-format episodic storytelling gave
artists the opportunity to develop character

78
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:09.020
beats as much as the writers.

79
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.970
These books, which are primarily visual, had
the opportunity to show, rather than tell.

80
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.020
The heartbroken expression on Wanda’s face
could say just as much as a line of dialogue.

81
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.030
You didn’t need to describe Captain America’s
fighting style, you could show it.

82
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.030
Again.

83
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.030
Props to Jack Kirby.

84
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.160
Which means that creators could establish
character traits without describing them explicitly.

85
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.580
Instead, repeatedly showing the readers how
these characters acted.

86
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.030
But to do this, it takes multiple instances
of showing the audience before it really begins

87
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.420
to sink in as a pattern.

88
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.080
But being able to flush out characters over
longer periods of time allowed for these kinds

89
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.440
of patterns to develop, and for clear — or
at least somewhat clear — rules about how

90
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.940
this character would act in certain situations
to arise.

91
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.630
And it was during this magical time when comics
were still free enough to have entire issues

92
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.050
of dialogue, and allow female characters to
be different, that the gays first started

93
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.410
gravitating toward The Scarlet Witch.

94
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:12.340
But how did this suburban housewife with two
kids become the gay icon we know her as today?

95
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:27.900
Well, like any good Bronze Age comics arc,
it’s a long story.

96
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.590
When it comes to comic book stories, people
usually default to Origin stories as the means

97
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.080
of developing an early gauge for the character.

98
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.169
The origin story is pivotal to a comic book
character because they usually outline why

99
00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.889
the hero fights.

100
00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:42.889
At least…

101
00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:43.889
the good ones do.

102
00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.229
The quintessential archetype in this case
is Batman.

103
00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.599
His parents were killed in a random act of
violence, and so he sets out to prevent random

104
00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:51.840
acts of violence.

105
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.400
Since then, Batman’s whole psychological
state of being has been expanded to the point

106
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.990
where there’s an argument to make that his
central rogues gallery can be seen as a reflection

107
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.060
of his own psychosis.

108
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.789
The penguin as per his status as established
wealth.

109
00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.729
The riddler as per his own egoism and intelligence-obsession.

110
00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.389
Two-face as per his conflicting ideologies
of justice.

111
00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.500
The joker represents his natural inclination
towards wanton theatrics.

112
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Etc.

113
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.270
In instances like Batman, Spider-Man, and
even Iron Man, a component of their backstory

114
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.370
features a trauma which then leads them to
compulsively prevent that trauma from happening

115
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.409
to others.

116
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.210
Other origin stories, like Superman, Captain
America, Dr. Strange, or various versions

117
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.139
of The Flash focus on why and how this character
has the abilities they do.

118
00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.760
And I’m not saying one leads to a better
character than the other.

119
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.379
But when it comes to origin trauma, Wanda
Maximoff could be a frontrunner for the worst.

120
00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:51.379
childhood.

121
00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:52.379
ever.

122
00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:56.590
She and her brother, Pietro, or Quicksilver,
were European orphans of Romani descent.

123
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.949
Without a family, they wandered around southeastern
Europe, taking work and accommodations when

124
00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:01.949
they could.

125
00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:02.960
It also happened that they were mutants —

126
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.060
Hello.

127
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.669
My name is James Somerton.

128
00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:10.159
You may recognize me from such videos as:
“Adult Gay Man Yells About Disney”

129
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:16.021
“Adult Gay Man Complains About Korean Webcomics”
“Adult Gay Man Yells About Disney 2: Release

130
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:19.500
The Gay Fish Boys”
…and the video you were just watching.

131
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.389
I realize I just said that Wanda Maximoff
is a mutant, and implied that’s where her

132
00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:26.199
powers come from.

133
00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.680
Before going forward, I’d like to take a
moment to acknowledge that this is an egregious

134
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.130
simplification, and depending upon which comic
you’re reading, Wanda may or may not still

135
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.279
be a mutant.

136
00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.880
For more information about the powerset of
the Scarlet Witch, please see my other video:

137
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.779
Marvel’s Gay Power Couple.

138
00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:46.470
Which, itself is a gross simplification.

139
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.810
Now, let’s return to our regularly scheduled
programming.

140
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.950
It also happened that they were murtants coming
into their powers.

141
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.670
Which led to them being chased out of a number
of villages.

142
00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.550
This kind of childhood and early-life development
itself is rife for a lot of presumed trauma.

143
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.370
And naturally because it’s trauma that happened
off panel, a lot of people don’t really

144
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.370
register it.

145
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:12.180
But we gays are great at reading into things
that are only inferred.

146
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.480
Consider the lonely state the twins were in:
without family or support and being procedurally

147
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.410
chased out of every settlement that would
tolerate them enough to only spit at them,

148
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.760
that’s kinda messed up all on it’s own.

149
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.200
How does that generate a functional person?

150
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.410
Marvel was being absolutely sympathetic to
these characters when they pointed out just

151
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.960
how easy it would be for Magneto to recruit
them into his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

152
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.050
Whereas Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne only
witnessed the death of parental figures, the

153
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:46.060
Maximoff twins had to endure day-in/day-out
traumatic experiences, completely alone except

154
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.070
for each other.

155
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:54.040
Which, the MCU explicitly depicts in WandaVision,
showing us the death of the Maximoff parents,

156
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.750
beat for beat how it had only been described
years earlier in Age of Ultron.

157
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.320
And in spite of this incredibly graphic-for-Disney
depiction of violence, there are still people

158
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.730
out there who champion the traumatic roots
of Spiderman and Batman, while saying that

159
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:14.450
Wanda didn’t really have any reason to accidentally
take a town hostage because she needed a vacation

160
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.529
from life.

161
00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:17.360
But more on that to come!

162
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.990
Suffice to say, Wanda’s origins factor in
a heavy amount of trauma, and rather than

163
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.529
this trauma being focused around a matter
of individuals, it’s directed at a much

164
00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:29.560
broader sense of humanity.

165
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:36.050
How humans, as a group, will treat other specific
human beings who are not specifically just

166
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.170
like them.

167
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.260
Already, the gay appeal is written into the
subtext of her character.

168
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.620
However, though Wanda (and Quicksilver) make
their debut as super villains, they quickly

169
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.279
have a change of heart and join the Avengers.

170
00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:53.769
Because as soon as Wanda is given a better
option than being a bad guy, she takes it.

171
00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:57.820
While they’d always been reluctant villains
while in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,

172
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.070
becoming such staples of the Avengers signified
that they could have been great heroes from

173
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.970
the very beginning, if they had gotten the
chance.

174
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.920
Magneto simply found them first.

175
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.990
While it’s true that Stan Lee made the conflict
between the X-Men and the Brotherbood as an

176
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.630
allegory for civil rights, he did later admit
that an allegory for gay rights was also valid,

177
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.910
in retrospect.

178
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.510
And admittedly, a queer reading of the Maximoff’s
origin may be a bit of a stretch.

179
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.480
But going forward, Wanda begins to embody
more queer experiences on the pages of Avengers

180
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480
titles.

181
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.889
And that said, I can’t be entirely sure
if it’s not deliberate.

182
00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:38.779
Marvel writers of the 70s and especially 80s
adopted a very heavy-handed approach to advocating

183
00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:40.200
for social rights.

184
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.269
However, it’s also just a thing that queer-adjacent
themes wind up in otherwise ‘straight’

185
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:49.899
media — because it simply makes for compelling
drama.

186
00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.750
Romance hidden from the public eye?

187
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.750
Family shame?

188
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.750
Disowning?

189
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.750
Striking out on one’s own?

190
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.270
Found family?

191
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:02.199
These things are generally uncommon in straight
circles, so they’re seen as heightened drama.

192
00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:06.670
Whereas queer people — even if you yourself
haven’t experienced this, you have a friend

193
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.670
who has.

194
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.449
But even if the Scarlet Witch wasn’t written
with exclusively queer appeal, it is a reason

195
00:12:12.449 --> 00:12:16.660
for why queer people, even on a subliminal
level, found her appealing.

196
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.470
And she had lots of drama.

197
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.339
However, her first role on the Avengers wasn’t
to be Vision’s girlfriend and wife.

198
00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:26.320
Wanda was the first real Avenger to show any
heart.

199
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.889
Villains would often target her as a damsel
in distress simply because she was the least

200
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:33.060
inclined toward open combat.

201
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.550
However, Wanda had a penchant for, as a captive
or not, reasoning and empathizing with these

202
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.550
villains.

203
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.459
But in spite of this semi-regular pattern,
The Scarlet Witch was routinely described

204
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:49.920
as one of the most powerful Avengers — and
this was even before her first power-explosion

205
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.980
in the Darker Than Scarlet story arc.

206
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.210
Which the other kind of… curious thing about
the Scarlet Witch is that even before she

207
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.980
had queer children of her own, she found herself
mothering those who had been outcast.

208
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.040
Specifically in one case, she encouraged Toad
to leave Magneto behind… because the master

209
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.060
of magnetism didn’t seem to treat his brotherhood
of mutants with that much respect.

210
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.329
In spite of the fact that most found Mortimer
Toynbee to be repulsive, Wanda took it upon

211
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:23.100
herself to look out for the lil’ guy.

212
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.380
And sure this may be an instance of Wanda
being ‘the woman hero’ who, as feminist

213
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.269
critics argue is the role for women in action,
to be caring and resolve conflict through

214
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:34.269
empathy.

215
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:38.270
It’s worth noting that while Wanda conforms
to this, she is the gross exception among

216
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.509
Marvel women.

217
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:42.960
The only other character like her that I can
think of would be Sue Storm.

218
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.480
Because, yes, you had ‘the moms’ but most
of Marvel’s female heroes were She-Hulk,

219
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.420
the Wasp, Tigra, Kitty Pryde, Storm, Emma
Frost, Mystique, one of…

220
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.160
Jean Grey’s clones or alternate reality
evil twins.

221
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.050
But as far as gay appeal, the 70s and 80s
were a time where a lot of queer people had

222
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.480
mothers who rejected them.

223
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.760
And the mothers we did have were the mothers
that chose us, not necessarily the ones who

224
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.579
brought us into the world.

225
00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:13.199
Wanda was abundantly established as a ‘mom’
who did choose you.

226
00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:14.199
So…

227
00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:16.380
That’s touching, at the very least.

228
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.690
However, unlike Sue Storm who became Sue Richards,
Wanda was not strictly heterosexualized.

229
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.970
When you add in the other things…

230
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.760
Like the tumultuous youth of being shamed
and scorned by society at large.

231
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.180
Going to New York and developing a found family
who wants to take the things about you society

232
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.800
has rejected and use it to help people.

233
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.339
And then… to say nothing of finding a surrogate
maternal figure in Agatha Harkness.

234
00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:46.440
(Wandavision had a significant departure from
the comics here, both of them Drag-Queen-Esque)

235
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.460
When it comes to all of that, Wanda does begin
to embody — at least a very sensitive and

236
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:57.390
comics-code friendly depiction of what the
queer community was going through at the time.

237
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.769
Before House of M dominated the Marvel fandom’s
perception of the Scarlet Witch, and many

238
00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:05.639
fans to this day believe that’s the only
significant thing that she ever provided to

239
00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:11.630
Marvel 616, the Scarlet Witch was most notably
recognized for her rather…

240
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.330
queer love affair…

241
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:22.329
with a robot.

242
00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:29.270
Or, to be more politically correct, Synthezoid.

243
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.699
Now Human/Robot romances are, to this day,
not at all very common.

244
00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:37.860
So back in the day, it was seen as a bit of
an anomaly.

245
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.209
For months and months, these two played soap
opera with readers' feelings.

246
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.730
Will-they/won’t-they constantly.

247
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:50.009
Because though Wanda was very open with her
feelings for Vision, Vision felt that a romance

248
00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:52.269
between the two of them was improper.

249
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:53.269
Eventually…

250
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:54.320
you know.

251
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.880
That wasn’t an issue.

252
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.940
But for the duration of their marriage, they
constantly had to justify themselves to others.

253
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.199
‘Yes, I’m Wanda.

254
00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:03.510
A human/mutant.

255
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.880
And yes, this is my husband.

256
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.890
A robot.’

257
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.990
In the same way that gay people… never really
stop coming out, you know?

258
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.139
And sometimes it didn’t go very well.

259
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:16.350
When Quicksilver stopped by Avengers Mansion
to announce his shotgun wedding to Crystal

260
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.959
of the Inhumans (it didn’t work) — his
sister proudly announced her romance with

261
00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:21.959
The Vision.

262
00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:27.829
To which Quicksilver was utterly disgusted,
and disowned her on the spot.

263
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:32.940
Granted, given the time period this also could
have been made to represent familial disgust

264
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.949
at inter-racial relationships.

265
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:36.149
But hey.

266
00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:37.560
This allegory is one-size-fits-all.

267
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.560
So.

268
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.850
Having a wildly temperamental family who have
weirdly specific decency-related expectations

269
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.470
for what you ought to do with your life is
absolutely a gay mood.

270
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.660
So queer comic book readers would have seen
this and immediately read it as something

271
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.440
that had either happened to them or a friend.

272
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.029
And one thing that is part of the queer community,
and the role that queer-coding may have had

273
00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:05.070
is up to some debate, is that we gravitate
toward those who have experienced queer-like

274
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.070
expiriences.

275
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.260
And this applies to real life.

276
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.260
Consider the Free Brittany movement where
she was kept under the control of men who

277
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.430
did not have her best interests at heart.

278
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.190
Also, to a lesser extent, the solidarity around
Brenden Fraiser’s decade-long self-care

279
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.820
hiatus because of so much Hollywood trauma.

280
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.690
Even if the individual is not queer themselves,
if any straight person would know what it’s

281
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.930
like, it would be people who share our experiences.

282
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:36.940
And we do tend to gravitate toward people
who go through these queer-adjacent expiriences

283
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.730
and come out of the other side as a nurturing,
empathetic individual.

284
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.390
Who, not only themselves try to live normal
lives, but who want to help others do the

285
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.390
same.

286
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:51.430
Though it’s not really part of the Pride
discourse, there were, in earlier Pride Parades,

287
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:56.290
a presence of accepting mothers who would,
either by proxy of their own queer children

288
00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:01.840
or of their own vocation, would be part of
queer circles to be surrogate moms.

289
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.180
And while this was never in a comic, I can
absolutely see Wanda from the 70s and 80s

290
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.620
doing something like that.

291
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.170
Ooh… head cannon.

292
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.100
Willed her own children to be queer so she
could have a foothold in the community to

293
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.640
be the community mom.

294
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.100
Marvel’s over there sleeping on this while
they figure out how to shove as many fridgable

295
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.630
gays and rainbow flags into Spider Man games.

296
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.260
But when it comes to Wanda going through the
kinds of traumas she has, however queer-coded

297
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.510
they may be, she just wanted a simple life.

298
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:34.070
Wanda, in spite of the magic powers, a superhero
found-family, and a fabulous penchant for

299
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.380
red velvetine, kind of craves the domestic
life.

300
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.600
Contrary to Marvel’s other power-couples
of the time, Sue and Reed, Janet and Hank,

301
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.560
Jean and Scott, Wanda actively seeks time
off from the Avengers to become a homeowner

302
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.060
and home maker.

303
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.220
And didn’t marry an abusive husband.

304
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.340
Whereas the others kept their relationships
and marriages going with their respective

305
00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.140
teams, Wanda and Vision — two of the most
powerful superheroes ever — were content

306
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.430
to bum out in the suburbs for a while.

307
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.150
Which is something that may be reflected in
our own fight for rights.

308
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.480
(Not mine but maybe yours.)

309
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.090
That the battles we were fighting for so long
were for nothing more than to be able to choose

310
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.370
a quiet life, if we wanted.

311
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.820
And though this pairing was absolutely unorthodox
even by comic book standards, it was the fairytale

312
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.010
couple that worked out far better than the
‘normies.’

313
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:28.180
Janet was a victim of domestic abuse, Sue
was an invisible woman in the sense that she

314
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.820
was almost entirely neglected by Reed (who
is a bit of a bastard), and it took about

315
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:38.760
0.02 seconds of married life before Soctt
decided to start hooking up with Emma Frost.

316
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.140
Vision and Wanda, however, slept in on Saturdays,
they were affectionate, kind, understanding,

317
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.560
and had open, honest communication.

318
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.970
Imagine that.

319
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.700
The couple that everyone thought was too weird
to function ended up being really one of the

320
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.250
only marriages in comic book history that
‘worked.’

321
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.940
Especially one between two super-powered characters,
as there is a literal imbalance of power in

322
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.280
instances like Lois and Clark.

323
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.250
Sure, the Avengers were cool with it.

324
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.880
But left, right, and center these two had
to justify the ground they walked on.

325
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.280
Both as a mutat, a robot, and the fact that
they were married.

326
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.760
With Children.

327
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.310
In the limited run special ‘The Vision and
the Scarlet Witch’, these are the majority

328
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.580
of trials the couple has to navigate.

329
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.490
They both seem comfortable fighting witches
and zombies — however the greater struggle

330
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.960
is standing their ground against neighbors
and social forces that want to drive their

331
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960
marriage apart.

332
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.350
But they were determined to not let that happen.

333
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.440
Wanda spent her youth being chased away and
running from every place she may have considered

334
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440
a home.

335
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.190
And now as a married woman, she chose now
to stand her ground against bigotry instead

336
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.160
of packing up and leaving at the first sign
of friction.

337
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160
Which…

338
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.660
does kind of mirror the path to Gay rights.

339
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.700
Don’t you think?

340
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.110
While in the first half of the 20th century,
the cultural mindset of gay communities was

341
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.230
a more…

342
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.950
hit-and-run style approach to rights.

343
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.830
Make strides where we can, but stay fluid
so that there’s no foundation that institutional

344
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.420
bigotry can target.

345
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.650
This was how P.R.I.D.E.

346
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.920
(Personal Rights In Deffence and Education
— emphasis on the deffence part) managed

347
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.720
to make progress on queer activisim, where
gay rights groups before then tried to ‘play

348
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.690
by the rules’ and made very little headway.

349
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.600
But the shock-and-awe tactics of P.R.I.D.E.

350
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.160
depended on being able to show up where it
was inconvenient for the straights and then

351
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.380
disappear before the cops showed up.

352
00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.080
Moving into the 1980s P.R.I.D.E.

353
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:35.090
had long been disbanded under some game-of-thrones
style drama from WITHIN the queer community.

354
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.890
The cultural attitude of Queerness had shifted
and progressed to the point where we decided

355
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.190
we were done running.

356
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.310
There came the point where we decided to plant
our flags, where we were going to fight for

357
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.030
the spaces our community occupied.

358
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.530
And while holding onto a handful of inner-city
street corners had been something that the

359
00:21:53.530 --> 00:22:01.250
community had always struggled with, the rise
of HIV added a sense of urgency.

360
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.860
Holding on to our physical spaces was once
a matter of building and maintaining our communities

361
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:11.200
and cultural identity, but now was a matter
of survival.

362
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.371
Communities became essential for our ability
to monitor and take care of eachother, but

363
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:20.350
also to prevent us from being pushed out of
our neighborhoods while we died in droves

364
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.940
to a plague our political leaders did nothing
about.

365
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.870
Having our spaces was something we could hold
onto while we lost friends and community leaders.

366
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.680
Disparate and separate we were more vulnerable.

367
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.780
But congregating in local areas allowed our
dwindling community to continue organizing

368
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.300
and fighting.

369
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.800
Like us, there were only so many places Wanda
could run before she realized that standing

370
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.540
your ground was the only option she had left.

371
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.150
And this may be why we identify with Marvel’s
mutants as a whole (Wanda specifically, for

372
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.100
being the only mutant in a friend group of
normies), because it brings up the question

373
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:05.960
of how much do we have to do and how far do
we have to go to be recognized as worthy of

374
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.040
simple human dignity?

375
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.750
I suppose that isn’t even really a queer
problem.

376
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.470
It’s long been held that Marvel is about
humans trying to be Gods, and DC is about

377
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:20.230
gods trying to be human — but I feel like
the real distinction is that Marvel characters

378
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:26.540
routinely save lives, save the world, save…
existence — and still the world as a whole

379
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.100
avidly hates them.

380
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:34.670
It doesn’t really matter to the denizens
of Earth 616, The Scarlet Witch is a mutant.

381
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.610
And as people are told to hate mutants, they
hate Wanda.

382
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.590
I mean it doesn’t help her case that Jean
is over there repeatedly eating stars and

383
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.670
solar systems for the lolz.

384
00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.810
And this is the person the X-Men actively
keep trying to resurrect so I can understand

385
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:53.470
a little bit about why human kind looks at
the X-Men like: “yeah… maybe no.”

386
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.910
And as we’re talking about allegory, I think
this is now a good time to bring up the issues

387
00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:03.060
I have with using super-powers as an allegory
for being oppressed.

388
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.660
Because while they may represent minority
groups suffering under systemic oppression

389
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:13.040
because bigotry, it’s worth reminding everyone
that the X-Men have superpowers.

390
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.360
Queer people, immigrant communities, black
people, and indigenous peoples do not have

391
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360
superpowers.

392
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.590
We’re pretty amazing, but we can’t toss
cars in the air or turn invisible.

393
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.180
(Unless we’re on tinder.)

394
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.850
And when some mutants have the power to look
at a tear gas canister and turn it into cotton

395
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:33.190
candy, I feel like the analogy — and the
way that writers constantly bring it up as

396
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:38.490
justification for letting the X-Men run an
extra-judicious private army of minors who

397
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:43.280
make demands on global sovereignties — becomes
a little disrespectful.

398
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.660
The thing about oppression and being oppressed
is that you cannot even make your own government

399
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.810
listen to you.

400
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.390
But there go the mutants and then X-men…
demanding private islands that they proceed

401
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.360
to mess up with their soap opera drama.

402
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.360
But not Wanda.

403
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.890
Who, even before House of M was accused of
being a class traitor by the X-Men, and X-men

404
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.410
fans.

405
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.350
Referencing Wanda’s role on X-Men: Evolution
where she was a raving lunatic with too much

406
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.160
witchy power — five years before House of
M was published.

407
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.080
This look and vibe was drawn specifically
from The Craft’s Nancy.

408
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.010
But superimposing Nancy on Wanda is a bit
of an…

409
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.390
This was, naturally, a staunch departure from
the soft-spoken, over-powered avenger who

410
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.860
prefers a supportive role on the team.

411
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.640
And of course was aping on the ‘more evil
female counterpart of the main villain’

412
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.570
trope you see popping up now and then.

413
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:44.150
Not only mutants, but out of Marvel heroes
as a whole, Wanda chose the American dream.

414
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:50.070
Whereas other couples were heiresses, lived
in techno towers, or lived the fast life of

415
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.970
saving the world, Wanda (the mutant-witch
with strong ties to the primordial forces

416
00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:00.460
of chaos) and The Vision (a mechanical living
organism who is often cited as the most intelligent

417
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:06.720
being on the planet), chose a house in the
suburbs with a picket fence.

418
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.760
They would rather live there, among humans,
than rent out a room in the Charles Xavier

419
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.790
Echo Chamber for Gifted Youngsters.

420
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.900
And I feel that both among the fanbase and
ride-or-die X-men writers, they would have

421
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.170
seen this as a betrayal from Wanda.

422
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.800
The X-Men’s messaging being that their strength
is in numbers, what happens when one of them

423
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.990
decides not to join the crew?

424
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:33.770
In the absolutist worldview of comic books,
Wanda is neither a GOOD mutant with the Xmen…

425
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.880
nor a BAD mutant with the Brotherhood.

426
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.130
So what is she?

427
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.900
Well… if you’re not with us…

428
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.730
Instead consider Wanda’s referenced past.

429
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.130
Her running from village to village in eastern
Europe while her only glimpse of America would

430
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.220
have been pamphlets and scant visions of television
programming.

431
00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.010
Sitcoms and romcoms and musicals about the
American simple life.

432
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.650
The American Dream.

433
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:06.290
Things that, as a wandering outcast, would
have been completely inaccessible to her.

434
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:11.540
Wanda would not want the camaraderie of other
mutants because the first mutant to extend

435
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.050
a hand to her ended up being a total sociopath.

436
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:22.030
Out of everyone in Marvel, it makes sense
why Wanda would crave domestication, and why

437
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.710
that life would appeal to her.

438
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.130
What she wanted was the lifestyle she, as
an Avenger, had fought to protect.

439
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.370
After saving New York, America, and the world…

440
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.480
doesn’t she deserve a bit of a honeymoon?

441
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.920
Given that The Avengers team from 1963-2005
made $2000 a week, Wanda had probably saved

442
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.040
up enough money to buy a whole lot more.

443
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.410
The suburbs were what she chose because she
had an opportunity to live the life that had

444
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.930
been denied to her.

445
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.610
Which really does fit the gay expirience doesn’t
it?

446
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.390
All we wanted was the option to live the life
that straight people took for granted.

447
00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:03.870
Regardless of who we chose to share our house
with, or what color blanket a nurse wrapped

448
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.780
us in when we were born.

449
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:10.670
And t thing about Wanda and Vision was that
it worked.

450
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.370
Things were going great.

451
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:18.180
They had children and, unlike the occupants
of Baxter tower, nobody was pointing any weaponized

452
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.880
technology at an infant.

453
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.060
And just when it seemed like they were really
going to make it, somebody pulled the rug

454
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.600
out from under them.

455
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.620
Vision and Wanda were broken up by forces
outside of their control.

456
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.790
Someone who was thought to be a friend, and
supportive of their marriage, it turned out,

457
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:40.390
only really ever saw the Vision as a machine.

458
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:46.180
With her husband lost to government bureaucracy
who refused to see him as human, Wanda’s

459
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.040
children vanished.

460
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.660
Taken away from her by a malevolent demonic
entity.

461
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.220
Also… something queer people have had to
deal with through history.

462
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.990
We’ve lost our partners and had our children
taken away.

463
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.620
It was never real.

464
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.810
The marriage.

465
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.810
The children.

466
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:09.780
It was a series of events manipulated by the
totalitarian, micromanagerial, timespace bureaucrat

467
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.820
who officiated the marriage in the first place.

468
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.120
The whole thing was just to exploit and manipulate
Wanda.

469
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.330
But her hope, her trauma, her past didn’t
matter.

470
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.500
She was a tool to fit his agenda.

471
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.000
Just like, in the early 1990s, as Bill Clinton
campaigned to be president, he promised the

472
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.160
LGBT community rights.

473
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.470
Marriage equality, legal protection, and the
ability to serve in the military.

474
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.060
He was our ally.

475
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.130
Our friend.

476
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:44.260
And then once in office signed bills explicitly
banning gay marriage and gay military service.

477
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.010
We were a tool to fit his agenda.

478
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.980
Being used as a political tool, and then discarding
us as a compromise for what an elected representative

479
00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.180
really wants is not something limited to queer
people.

480
00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.811
But what draws Wanda’s life closer to queerdom
is her campaign for love, marriage, and the

481
00:30:02.811 --> 00:30:07.570
strife she faced for simply having a place
of her own.

482
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:12.820
Even today, where queer acceptance is much
greater than it has been for quite some time,

483
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:19.180
at least in North Ameirca, queer youth and
even adults struggle to find a place in society.

484
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.460
One that is determined by their expression
of identity, and not what is convenient for

485
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.710
hegemonistic census takers and advertisers.

486
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.350
Queer communities are constructed by merrit
and self-description, and not birthright.

487
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:37.190
So there isn’t exactly a predetermined roadmap
for us — neither one that we can conform

488
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.510
to nor one that we can resist.

489
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:45.650
And every time the hetero-hegimony tries to
quantify us — bloop!

490
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.110
Another gender identity materializes and we
destabilize another algorithm.

491
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.600
We have no determined paths — because we
have no inherited history.

492
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.530
We have no family tree to give us cultural
roots.

493
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:03.160
And that might seem nihilistic, but from an
optimistic angle: without a history, we get

494
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.190
to choose our own future.

495
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.130
Having rights doesn’t mean we need to all
ship ourselves off to the suburbs.

496
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:14.650
It just means that if that’s what you are,
if that’s what you want — the option ought

497
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.080
to be available to you.

498
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.510
And a discussion about choice, availability,
and wanting a life with significantly less

499
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:25.520
trauma than how we were raised is a much more
modern queer problem.

500
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.650
But don’t worry.

501
00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:36.850
Against all probability, we, and the Scarlet
Witch, are still relevant.

502
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:50.190
I mean Wanda’s publication history is one
thing, but most people haven’t read every

503
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.830
issue of the Avengers circa 1963-2022.

504
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.270
So why do gays still flock to her deffense?

505
00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:02.600
Somehow she’s this unforgivable figure of
targeted ire.

506
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.920
Most X-Men fans who read House of M didn’t
read the full Scarlet Witch backstory.

507
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.440
They knew the basics, and they knew that she
popped up now and then.

508
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.420
Heck — most Avengers fans hadn’t taken
the time to read through the spin-off West-Coast

509
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:21.070
Avengers titles that lived and died in the
1980s where most of Wanda’s story took place.

510
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.460
And so when Wanda pops up in the movies…

511
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.910
they think this is what she’s here to do.

512
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.840
Ignoring the 40 years that she spent saving
the world, she’s getting set up to be public

513
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.460
enemy number one.

514
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.600
But to other people, notably, gay fans in
the know, she’s here to be a baby oven to

515
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.390
spit out two gloriously queer babies that
Disney will absolutely put in theatrical releases

516
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:47.290
and would absolutely not relegate to streaming
on Disney+.

517
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.720
(In select countries.)

518
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.000
And in this post-Wandavision landscape…

519
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.580
It seems the essentialist good-guy/bad-guy
mentality of comics publishing — arguably

520
00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.890
the worst part about comics — has migrated
into the fans of comic book movies.

521
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.620
Back when it was clear who the good guys and
bad guys were, the fandom was so wholesome.

522
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.950
Maybe a little cringe, but we all got along.

523
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:13.340
Because you could point at flag-and-sheild-man
and say: good.

524
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.090
And everyone grunts and approvingly nods.

525
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.460
You could point at war-crimes-metal-suit-with-lasers-man,
and even though he had crossed demilitarized

526
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:26.070
zones and conducted the assassination of forigen
bodies in a soverign nation, you can point

527
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.220
to him and say: ‘good.’

528
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.560
You could point at cosmic-war-crimes-hammer-man
who attempted an interdimensional insurrection

529
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.670
and say: good.

530
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:41.030
You could even point to war-crimes-metal-arm-man
who was mind-controlled into committing said

531
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.020
war crimes and say: good.

532
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.790
You could point at war-crimes-blasty-fist-lady
who then, upon realizing the imperialist intent

533
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.600
of her nationalistic culture, turned around
and helped oppressed peoples and say…

534
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.690
Oh wait, that one’s a little contentious,
isn’t it?

535
00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.260
I’m sure it’s an exception to the rule.

536
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.260
Bad example.

537
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.260
OH!

538
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.330
You could point to war-crimes-spy-lady who
was routinely exploited for sexuality and

539
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.330
say: good.

540
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.020
At least until she kicked up a fuss about
being paid what she was deserved.

541
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.020
And then…

542
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.110
Well that’s a bit of a hot button issue.

543
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.570
So when we get to Wanda…

544
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:18.880
Can we really say that the Marvel fandom changed
when they were given a complex character who

545
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.020
openly struggles with morality?

546
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:28.409
Or can we finally admit there’s a bit of
a pattern here in the threshold of moral tolerance?

547
00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.780
About the kinds of characters that many fans
are willing to empathize with.

548
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:38.050
Because you can take a look at war-crimes-horny-egoist-person
who committed multiple murders, genocides,

549
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:42.090
and interdimentional insurrections and say:
good.

550
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.730
And people will probably agree.

551
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.960
Oh how they will rush to the defense of Loki
with caveats and cited psychological studies

552
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.120
about adopted children, and twin studies,
and ‘oh my experience as a younger brother’,

553
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.140
and everything that can possibly be done to
explain why, though their actions are immoral,

554
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:01.040
their emotional condition justifies their
actions.

555
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.740
Their actions came from a place of pain and
neglect.

556
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.740
Loki?

557
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.740
Evil?

558
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.740
NEVER.

559
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.740
But Wanda…

560
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.250
I have concerns for society.

561
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.250
Sure, on the level of media literacy, but
also on the grounds of… what do you expect

562
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.580
from Justice?

563
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.580
Like.

564
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.580
Capital J justice.

565
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.060
What’s the deal?

566
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.300
Assuming we include the explosion in Captain
America: Civil War as part of Wanda’s kill

567
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.770
count — which… if that explosion had gone
off at the base of that building, a whole

568
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:34.630
lot more people would have died — she’s
still far behind literally all the Avengers…

569
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.950
except, oddly, Vision.

570
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:42.470
And even then, she was only a ‘war criminal’
because a collection of governments decided

571
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.580
that she was too dangerous to be allowed to
go to the damn grocery store.

572
00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:52.230
Don’t you love it when your identity is
automatically made ‘criminal.’

573
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.910
But going over Wandavision, I’m still not
sure how people can have a takeaway that she

574
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.750
was maliciously twisting reality around her
finger for her own bemusement.

575
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:08.590
This show dedicated an entire episode — one
of the longer ones — to exploring her trauma,

576
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.130
which most of it, even then, was implicit.

577
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.130
That’s right.

578
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:16.581
Machine guns on the streets below her apartment,
and her mom shrugged it off like it was no

579
00:36:16.581 --> 00:36:17.581
big deal.

580
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:22.880
I’m assuming that those of you watching
this video who know what that’s like can

581
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.440
fill in the blanks.

582
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.210
And then we actually SEE her parents die in
a missile explosion.

583
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.650
That’s DARK.

584
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.400
I didn’t expect that from Disney.

585
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.790
And then we go from there to ‘oh well she
joined Hydra so she’s BAD.’

586
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.780
Really though I can’t imagine growing up
as an orphan in that world would have been

587
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.170
a walk in the park.

588
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:46.800
The reality of the Maximoffs volunteering
for Hydra was a matter of being desperate—

589
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.570
This wasn’t even subtext, this is just what
was literally in the script.

590
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.590
Maria: File says they volunteered for Strucker’s
experiments.

591
00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.690
That’s nutts.

592
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.790
Steve: Right.

593
00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:00.630
What kind of monster would let a German scientist
experiment on them to protect their country?

594
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.840
And this is just the baggage she had before
the Avengers.

595
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.820
Following that, she lost her brother.

596
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.900
And when she woke up from the blip, she lost
Steve, the only Avenger willing to stick up

597
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:17.550
for her, and she lost her implied mentorship
with Natasha, and she lost Vision.

598
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.110
And the only thing she really had to remember
him by was the deed to a plot of land he had

599
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.530
bought for them in suburban New Jersey.

600
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:30.850
So she gets to the place where their home
doesn’t exist, where it never would exist…

601
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:35.950
And, not for the first time in her life, her
powers take control of her subconscious and

602
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.830
create a safety net for her.

603
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:43.430
Her powers stopped a bomb from going off when
she was a child, shielding her physically.

604
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:49.120
And now her powers created a world where every
day wasn’t a life or death struggle.

605
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.560
Shielding her emotionally.

606
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.960
The problem with media literacy and Wandavision
is that, like ballet, you’re meant to extrapolate

607
00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.440
what’s going on from how the actors — specifically
Olsen and Bettany — are carrying themselves.

608
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.540
This is not the posture of someone who is
actively choosing to create a perfect world.

609
00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.550
This is a woman who just… she just needs
a break.

610
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:19.080
This is not the face of a woman who is maliciously
mind-controlling everyone to act like they’re

611
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.520
in a sitcom.

612
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:27.930
This is a Lynn Manuel Miranda-style writer-director-lead
actor who is so fed up with trauma after trauma,

613
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:33.570
that they are choosing to accept their own
fantasy and go a little crazy instead of dealing

614
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.410
with whatever darkness is in their soul.

615
00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:41.850
Wanda grew up with a vision of America built
from sitcoms.

616
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:45.480
She just assumed that everyone would be happy
if they were in one.

617
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:51.680
She is shocked and confused when she is confronted
with the reality of what she’s doing.

618
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.270
And she herself becomes more and more uncomfortable
with the situation as she becomes aware.

619
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:03.200
However, up until the point that she is aware
that her victims are experiencing her nightmares,

620
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.570
the ones she’s trying so hard to escape,
she does not believe that these people have

621
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:13.900
been given anything but a dreamlike existence.

622
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.140
She does not realize that they are directly
under her control.

623
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:23.880
Agatha: You’re even running illusions miles
away at the edge of town!

624
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.810
Magic on autopilot.

625
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:31.500
Harkening back to Avengers Disassembled when
she was out of her mind making an apple pie

626
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:38.540
with her dream-children while an illusory
Kree army killed Hawkeye — her friend and

627
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.840
staunchest advocate through the Avengers series.

628
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.580
From the textual and visual elements of the
series, we can conclude (and I say this with

629
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:52.590
the confidence of someone who actually engages
with the media they watch instead of scrolling

630
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.410
through their Phone while Pulp Fiction is
on and then declaring that this movie sucks

631
00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.730
because they don’t know what’s going on)
— we can conclude that Wanda was aware that

632
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.690
she created this reality, or that she became
aware.

633
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:09.430
But we can also conclude that she assumed
that everyone else had just as much agency

634
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.430
as she did.

635
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:13.260
Or at least was as happy as she was.

636
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:19.040
And she is horrified when she learns that
she had as much culpability as she did.

637
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.330
To the extent of having very little hesitation
in destroying her perfect world to set everyone

638
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.330
free.

639
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.330
Vision: I know you’ll set everything right.

640
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.330
Just not for us.

641
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.230
Wanda: No.

642
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:36.140
Not for us.

643
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.070
There was never a dilemma.

644
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:43.950
There was never a longing choice of should
I or shouldn’t I. Nope.

645
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.490
Wanda immediately set out to tear down her
hall of mirrors.

646
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.490
And…

647
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.820
I still don’t understand how people continue
to hold her culpable.

648
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:57.900
I mean the show maybe could have done without
the tired trope of using a black woman as

649
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.260
a therapist to a white woman in the end.

650
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.770
Monica didn’t know her that well and yet
she was the one to absolve her.

651
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:09.080
But that instance alone shouldn’t damn Wanda
to villanhood.

652
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.120
Certainly not given the amount of stuff that
other characters in comics and that other

653
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.610
characters in the MCU have gotten away with
while still being venerated.

654
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.860
Honestly, the most unbelievable thing about
the Scarlet Witch is that you can have someone

655
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:26.560
go through all the things she did in the comics
and still come out as a functional human being.

656
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:33.130
I mean when you’ve got the power to erase
existence and all you do is take some superpowers

657
00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:37.070
away, you’re probably doing the best you
can.

658
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.260
Movies-Wanda… is a little bit more rough
around the edges.

659
00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.680
Given that there’s no strict ‘nobody dies
in the avengers’ rules at Marvel Studios,

660
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.970
Wanda does have some blood on her hands.

661
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.160
And it’s blood that she doesn’t seem to
be allowed to wash off.

662
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.380
She’s made mistakes — big mistakes — when
trying to do the right thing.

663
00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.390
And even when she’s not trying to do the
right thing, she still makes mistakes.

664
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.220
But she’s not a real person either.

665
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.660
And while I have concerns about how Kevin
Feigie is going to treat a female character

666
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.330
with mental health issues around traumatic
experiences — especially given the reaction

667
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.740
to Game of Thrones’ take on what happens
when you give a lady too much power — my

668
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:21.450
real duress is not with the content — but
the ways that people are reading this media.

669
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:26.980
It says a lot to me, that there are hordes
of ‘American’ viewers who did sit through

670
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.710
all the Avengers movies, and who did see the
trauma highlight reel in Wandavision, and

671
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.350
their takeaway was: ‘she’s the bad guy.’

672
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:41.810
That in spite of veterans and psychological
associations weighing in on the show and praising

673
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:47.720
its honest depiction and empathy for victims
of severe PTSD, there are people who feel

674
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:53.860
that Wanda’s trauma, in spite of her successful
attempt to correct her mistakes, is no excuse

675
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.800
for her actions.

676
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.780
Even though Loki deliberately mind-controlled
people, they’re fine.

677
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.870
Peter Parker was abundantly comfortable giving
everyone in the universe amnesia because he

678
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:04.870
was inconvenienced.

679
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.080
He’s fine too.

680
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.770
But it really shouldn’t come as a shock
to me.

681
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.850
A man who said that ‘veterans with PTSD
are just weak’ ended up becoming the forty

682
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.040
fifth president of the United States.

683
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.850
So clearly some people agree with him.

684
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.320
And this is the world we live in.

685
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.070
One that has consistently de-valued mental
health to the point where most people older

686
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.560
than I am talk about therapists on hushed
lips.

687
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.580
Like seeing one is a scandal.

688
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.750
Consider the fact that existing outside the
hegemony — outside hetero-cis-normativity,

689
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:40.700
outside whiteness — that that entails an
amount of trauma.

690
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.120
In some cases serious life-or-death-experience
trauma.

691
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.540
Betrayal of friends and loved ones.

692
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.110
To say nothing of complex traumas from living
in a world where institutions are designed

693
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:54.170
to discriminate against you on a fundamental
level, and then being told by everyone who

694
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.630
thrives in these situations, and in these
institutions, that you’re just making a

695
00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.010
big deal out of nothing.

696
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.500
If there is no empathy for Wanda, then there
is no empathy for characters like Wanda.

697
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.530
For people like Wanda.

698
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.550
And if you cannot empathize with these fictional
characters — then I don’t have a whole

699
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.980
lot of faith that you can empathize with anyone
who isn’t Tony Stark.

700
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.720
Who isn’t white, rich, masculine, and in
possession of a penis.

701
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:26.170
He was traumatized because he saw space monsters,
and built a genocidal robot that, oh by the

702
00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.270
way, killed Wanda’s brother.

703
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.210
But his fanbase is SOLID.

704
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:35.610
The MCU has laid out a painstakingly detailed
account of Wanda Maximoff’s trauma.

705
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:39.370
To a gratuitous point where I don’t think
it would even feel at home in a soap opera.

706
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:49.930
Well maybe in a soap opera… we gays do love
a soap opera.

707
00:44:49.930 --> 00:45:02.800
It’s easy to mistake Wanda’s appeal to
queer folks as being a matter of camp.

708
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.340
Or diva worship.

709
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.330
That we flock to her the way we flock to Madonna
or Beyonce.

710
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:12.590
She’s got the outfits, she’s got the poses,
the powers, the gay kids.

711
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:16.870
And there is a camp of gay men who will condone
any villianous behaviour from such a woman

712
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.740
because she’s fierce.

713
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.570
But I’m bothered by that just as much as
the ones who demonize complex characters like

714
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.570
her.

715
00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.710
Wanda does not have to be a 100% hero.

716
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.440
Nor is she a villain.

717
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.800
Wanda is someone who tries to be a good person,
but given how much baggage she carts around,

718
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.600
struggles with trying to stay optimistic and
lighthearted.

719
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.890
And given that she’s aware that her abilities
have a terrible cost, and that her own subconscious

720
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:48.220
can hijack her powers and redevelop reality
without her conscious awareness, she’s under

721
00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.680
a lot of pressure.

722
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.990
And now that the MCU has roughly caught up
to her psychological state in the comics,

723
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:59.150
it’s disheartening to see that there is
a section of the audience that does not empathize

724
00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.200
with her struggles.

725
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.410
Or that they do not seem to have the ability
to see morality in shades of gray.

726
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:12.770
Or that, and this is relevant for criminal
prosecution, they do not care enough to make

727
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:18.120
the distinction between an action and the
context that leads to that action.

728
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.400
But the fact that Kevin Feigie, head honcho
of Marvel Studios, has signed Elizabeth Olsen

729
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.540
to a multi-movie contract does give me a bit
of hope.

730
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.050
Disney follows the money, and the money is
saying that people want more of the Scarlet

731
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.490
Witch.

732
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:38.210
That the watch-along parties of tough guys
ejecting their tear ducts at the end of Wandavision

733
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:44.570
was in the majority, and that there is empathy
and understanding in this world.

734
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:49.970
And that the rows upon rows of Wanda Hate
on social media timelines amount to a bunch

735
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:55.440
of people who don’t like that people seem
to be enjoying morally complex parables about

736
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.760
heroic figures who make mistakes.

737
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:04.790
Because everyone makes mistakes, and almost
nobody really feels that more than queer people.

738
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.200
Because it turns out that when you have to
suppress elements of yourself for the sake

739
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:14.360
of fitting into a hetero-normative landscape,
one which still to this day treats cis and

740
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.860
straight as the default, it can lead to some
pretty crappy behavior.

741
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.950
For gay people, trans people, nonbinary people,
bisexual people.

742
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.870
You get angry… and sometimes you lash out
at the people closest to you.

743
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.230
Even when they didn’t really do anything
wrong!

744
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.260
(Not intentionally, anyway.)

745
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.740
But their treatment of us may be a reminder
that there was something about us that didn’t

746
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.040
fit in quite right.

747
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.660
And yes it takes some time for us to realize
that it was nobody’s fault, and that they

748
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660
weren’t to blame.

749
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:49.110
But when we do come around and confront that
period of our lives and confront our own abominable

750
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:55.130
behavior, we hope that others will have the
understanding to forgive us.

751
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.440
Because here’s the Scarlet Witch.

752
00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.730
Who’s just… she’s just out to do the
right thing.

753
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.790
But at every.

754
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.790
single.

755
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.790
turn. of her life.

756
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:10.410
She’s hounded by some interdimentional being,
some absent father-figure terrorist, some

757
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:14.580
primordial god, some reclusive eastern-european
autocrat.

758
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:20.710
Girl just wants a two-story home with a single-car
garage and to badger her kids into good SAT

759
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.710
scores.

760
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.360
WHY IS THAT SUCH AN ASK?

761
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:29.140
Why is it such a huge leap of qualifications
and caveats when she just wants the same thing

762
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:34.000
that so many other people complain about having
to do?

763
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.869
The gays don’t need more divas from Marvel.

764
00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:38.160
We’ve got Storm.

765
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160
And Emma Frost.

766
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.910
She-Hulk, The Wasp, Moondragon, Dazzler, and
Elektra, from the comics.

767
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:47.990
The movies started off slow but we’re getting
our fair share of divas, now.

768
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:53.880
And though Comics-Wanda leans into the diva
poise, she is relishing in all the fancy,

769
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.780
fabulous things she was denied as a young
lady.

770
00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:03.340
The Heels, the capes, the corsets — she
specifically likes the dinner gloves: she

771
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:08.020
loves these fancy, effeminate things that
she never got to have growing up.

772
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:12.280
So now that she can get them, she’s gonna
wear it out to fight crime.

773
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.720
(Bit of a queer allegory, there.)

774
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.520
But when it comes to Movies-Wanda, Olsen is
not playing a diva.

775
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.020
This lady ran out to fight Agatha in sweats
and a ponytail.

776
00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.430
She wore hoodies and loose-fitting, feature-hiding
clothes.

777
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:33.110
I mean… she did have that glorious transformation
in Wandavision though, coming into her full

778
00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.250
power, realizing who and what she is.

779
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:41.520
Where she casts aside her hoodies and manifests
a hip-flaunting skirt, those long sleeves

780
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:46.590
with thumb holes, and face-framing headwear—

781
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:51.200
Okay come on was nobody gonna tell me this
was a trans read?

782
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200
Nobody?

783
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:58.140
I really had to be filming this at 3am — sleep
deprived — before I saw that?

784
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:05.110
In the end, whether its page or screen, Wanda
Maximof, The Scarlet Witch, is a survivor.

785
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.660
Queer people respect the poise and sass of
other Marvel Ladies.

786
00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.110
Their power and command.

787
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:15.360
But it’s Wanda’s determination to survive
without bringing more pain into the world

788
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.890
that we really identify with.

789
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:21.230
From the time she’s a child to the time
when she’s an adult, she deals with people

790
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:25.240
being afraid of her, hating her for what she
is.

791
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.730
And the queer community relates to that.

792
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.210
We see her living through trauma after trauma.

793
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:35.040
When things simply can’t get any worse…

794
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040
they do.

795
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.480
But she makes it.

796
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.480
Just like we do.

797
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.300
The lucky ones, anyway.

798
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.400
She is demonized and vilified.

799
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.260
In the comics when she tried to give everyone
their perfect life, the heroes of Marvel wanted

800
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.220
to kill her.

801
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.040
In the MCU when she tried creating the perfect
small town, filled with happy people, those

802
00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.630
people looked at her as a monster.

803
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:04.270
Because when they slept they dreamed her nightmares.

804
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.810
The nightmares that she lived everyday of
her life.

805
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:12.270
And when Wanda lets go of her perfect world,
her perfect kids, her perfect husband, and

806
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:19.270
walks back out into the streets of WestView…
the people of the small town stare at her

807
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.930
with hate and accusation.

808
00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:25.850
Contempt, now that they know what she is.

809
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.950
And isn’t that the fear of every gay kid
before they come out?

810
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:33.710
And make no mistake, from the day we’re
born we’re told that there’s a certain

811
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:34.790
way to live.

812
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:40.840
And when we come out, we get these little
pangs and subliminal notifications that we’re

813
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.820
inconvenient for the social order.

814
00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.540
That it would be easier for everyone if we
didn’t exist.

815
00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:53.220
And that asking for the slightest thing to
help ourselves be ourselves is a step too

816
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.220
far.

817
00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.680
And that resonates with us.

818
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.150
The vilification of our very selves.

819
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:05.680
So maybe forgiveness for Wanda is something
we give her because it’s what we hope for.

820
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.790
And if we can accept The Scarlet Witch for
struggling with the great responsibility of

821
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:18.710
her overwhelming power, then maybe we can
be accepted for being just a little bit messy.

822
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:26.610
And within this comic book character we can
offer her something that we ourselves desire:

823
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:31.460
to be forgiven for the crime of existing.
