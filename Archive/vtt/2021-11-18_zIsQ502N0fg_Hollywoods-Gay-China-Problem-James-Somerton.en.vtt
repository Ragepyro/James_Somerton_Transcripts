1
00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.580
Doing videos about gay representation in movies
and TV on a regular basis for about a year

2
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.359
and half now, I’ve gotten a lot — and
I mean a lot — of comments from people trying

3
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.829
to explain to me that the reason movie studios
dont put gay characters in their movies isn’t

4
00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.839
because of American or corporate homopboia.

5
00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.059
It’s not because they want to appease right
wing Christians.

6
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.110
And it’s certainly not because they know
they can get the gay money without creating

7
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.909
any real gay representation.

8
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.000
No.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.020
The real reason they don’t give us gay action
stars and super heroes is “China.”

10
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.479
They usually refer to it as the country as
a whole, too.

11
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.819
As if every single person in China signed
a letter to Hollywood demanding no gay characters

12
00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.640
in movies or TV.

13
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.350
Instead of the reality of it being the Chinese
government.

14
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.270
You can check the comments of any video I
make that mentions Disney and you’ll find

15
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.680
hundreds of these people explaining this to
me.

16
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.210
That I simply don’t understand the politics
of Hollywood or the business relationship

17
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.890
the industry has with China.

18
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.120
Well, I figured that since I actually have
a degree in film and another degree in business,

19
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.180
maybe I could actually explain this whole
situation in a bit more detail than you’d

20
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.920
usually get in a YouTube comment.

21
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.409
Because it is true that the Chinese government
has very anti-LGBT policies across the nation,

22
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.340
and they’re VERY not fond of any LGBT representation
in media… and both sets of policies are

23
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.969
actually becoming more draconian with each
passing day.

24
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.649
But what you might be shocked to find out
is that Hollywood is not required to bend

25
00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.729
to the will of the Chinese government in order
to make a profit.

26
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.280
In fact, the Chinese government is making
it less and less advantageous for studios

27
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220
to be their whipping boys.

28
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.640
And we’re gonna get to that...

29
00:02:16.640 --> 00:03:08.909
But first, let’s have a look at China’s
odd, winding journey into the film industry.

30
00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.829
So the first thing we need to talk about is
the box office, and how much money movies

31
00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.360
make while in theatres.

32
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.490
When studios report the projected box office
earnings of any given movie, usually on Sunday

33
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.860
but sometimes on Monday if it’s a long weekend,
you’ll see the gross amount the movie made

34
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.159
by selling tickets at movie theatres.

35
00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.269
That number will be broken up into two different
sections.

36
00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.319
Domestic, which includes the United States,
Canada.

37
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.870
And International, which is everyone else.

38
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.790
And then they’ll be combined for a Global
gross.

39
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.250
Gross being the most important word here.

40
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.760
In business terms, “gross income” is how
much is made before deductions, “net income”

41
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.819
is how much is made after deductions.

42
00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.980
Which, for most people, that means the Net
is how much money you get paid after the government

43
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.450
has taken its taxes, and you’ve paid your
health insurance, and all that.

44
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.350
The gross is always a much nicer number than
that.

45
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.890
Now when it comes to movies, studios never
EVER report the net income because that represents

46
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.400
how much profit is made by the movie.

47
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.530
And if they report the profit made publicly
that leaves them open to things like paying

48
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.569
higher taxes.

49
00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.180
A lot of actors also have points on a movie,
which means they get a certain percentage

50
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.280
of the profits.

51
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.210
Jack Nicholson notoriously got points on 1989’s
Batman, and publicly admitted to never having

52
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.590
to work again if he didn't want to.

53
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.240
But that’s not the only reason movie studios
don’t report net revenue from ticket sales.

54
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.450
The other, arguably more important reason,
is they don’t get to keep all of the ticket

55
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.340
sales from the get go.

56
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.080
Movie theatres take a giant chunk of that.

57
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.130
It tends to be different per studio and per
movie, with Disney demanding the highest percentage

58
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.780
of the box office returns, but it works out
to be around 50/50.

59
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.000
Studios will get a higher percentage when
a movie first comes out, and the percentage

60
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.500
will shift into the theatre’s favor the
longer a movie sticks around in cinemas.

61
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.630
So sometimes it’s not exactly 50/50, but
that’s the average.

62
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.090
And that’s not even getting into the fact
that marketing and distribution costs aren’t

63
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.900
calcuated into that figure.

64
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.330
Some movies have advertising campaigns that
cost as much as their production budget so

65
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.240
they’d need to make 4 times their budget
before they make a profit.

66
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.290
It can get so complicated that it’s no wonder
there’s an actual industry term called “Hollywood

67
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.290
Accounting.”

68
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.229
Yeah it’s mostly to hide money from the
government and people with profit participation,

69
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.009
but it’s also because you need to be a special
kind of accountant to wrap your head around

70
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.009
this whole thing.

71
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.540
And that’s just the studio side of it.

72
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.530
The theatre side can get complicated too.

73
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.759
That’s why you’ll see a lot of theatre
chains have special popcorn buckets and soda

74
00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.569
cups available for big new movies on opening
weekend.

75
00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.000
And charge a surcharge for them.

76
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.020
They want you to buy these things, which they
put a giant mark up on, so that they can bring

77
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.139
in more revenue at a time when any given movie’s
ticket sales will be mostly going to the studio.

78
00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.590
Some theatres, before the days of Covid anyway,
would also charge extra for assigned seating.

79
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.470
That extra money would go exclusively to the
theatre, since they’re charging a convenience

80
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.020
fee on top of the initial fee to see the movie.

81
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.419
And this has been the way that Hollywood worked
for a really long time.

82
00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.770
Ever since the supreme court decided that
movie studios were no longer allowed to own

83
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.770
theatre chains.

84
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.120
Which was a big thing back in the day.

85
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.830
Studios would own whole theatre chains and
only show their movies there.

86
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.789
So if you lived in a small town and your local
theatre was owned by Paramount but a Fox movie

87
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.690
was coming out that you really wanted to see,
well, you were shit out of luck.

88
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.370
Better hope it ends up in a second run theatre
in a few years.

89
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.259
But then, in the case of The United States
v. Paramount Pictures in 1948, it was decided

90
00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.930
that studios could no longer own theatres
and so this new 50/50 split was eventually

91
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.020
worked out.

92
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.539
This will be changing soon though since the
Justice Department under the former Trump

93
00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.800
administration decided to toss out the Paramount
Decrees so in August of 2022 Disney will be

94
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.710
allowed to buy as many theatres in the United
States as it wants.

95
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.050
But, for now, that 50/50 is still in effect.

96
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.580
And it’s all across the globe.

97
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.250
Europe, South America, Australia, and most
of Asia works under the same principle.

98
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.699
But then a fly landed in the ointment and
started messing things up.

99
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.540
A gigantic fly called China.

100
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.330
Filmmaking had taken off in China in the 1930s
when Chinese filmmakers, sick and tired of

101
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.300
Hollywood’s racist and offensive depictions
of the Chinese people, began making their

102
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.500
own feature films.

103
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.879
But After the communist revolution of 1949,
domestic films that were already released

104
00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.530
and a selection of foreign films were banned.

105
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.570
Despite this though, movie attendance increased
sharply.

106
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.289
But then during the Cultural Revolution, the
film industry was severely restricted, coming

107
00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.979
almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972.

108
00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.289
But in the years immediately following the
Cultural Revolution, the film industry flourished

109
00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:32.500
as a medium of popular entertainment.

110
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.690
Production rose steadily, from 19 movies in
1977 to 125 movies in 1986.

111
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.110
And the numbers of films just kept rising
from there, though a pretty big chunk of the

112
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.740
movies released were actually propaganda films
financed by the Chinese government.

113
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.970
Following the international commercial success
of films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

114
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.550
and Hero, Hollywood started to take notice
of the growing power of the Chinese market.

115
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.699
And so they began a campaign to have more
and more Hollywood movies released in China,

116
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:05.070
which the government at the time was more
than willing to let happen because it helped

117
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.340
the nation feel further legitimized by the
international community.

118
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.389
China wasn’t a communist backwater nation
like North Korea.

119
00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:16.830
It was a growing economy with happy citizens
who wanted to enjoy films from all over the

120
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.099
world.

121
00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:22.070
How happy their citizens really were is up
for debate but that’s the narrative the

122
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.780
Chinese government propagated.

123
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.419
At first Hollywood was actually able to negotiate
pretty good terms with the country.

124
00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:33.699
Something closer to a 40/60 split, with Hollywood
studios getting 60% of the box office returns.

125
00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:39.039
But as the Chinese box office began growing
year over year, the Chinese government began

126
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:44.030
to renege on those agreements, forcing studios
back to the negotiating table, sometimes twice

127
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.130
a year.

128
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.110
Whereas studios would sign decade long contracts
with American theatre chains.

129
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:55.490
All of this lead to today, where China reportedly
keeps a whopping 75-80% of the box office

130
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.490
returns.

131
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.900
With studios getting as little as 20%.

132
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.020
There’s no public financial data for representing
this because, again, studios like to keep

133
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.650
how much their movies make, and where that
money comes from, as secret as possible.

134
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.190
Lest they be forced to pay their share of
taxes.

135
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.170
But people in the industry who work on the
financial side of things seem to have loose

136
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.440
lips, and they’re more than happy to talk
about how China is screwing over an American

137
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440
industry.

138
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.839
Now 20% is better than nothing, right?

139
00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:28.520
Avengers Endgame made $629 million in China,
so 20% of that is about 126 million.

140
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.279
Nothing to sneeze at.

141
00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:35.050
It’s not the 315 million Disney would have
gotten under a 50/50 agreement but it’s

142
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.050
not nothing!

143
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.200
But Endgame may have made even more money
in China.

144
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.029
See, Chinese theatre chains have been known
to be a bit sneaky.

145
00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:47.279
Tourists visiting the country and going to
see movies while there have seen ticket sellers

146
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:51.570
take your money for a Hollywood movie, ring
up the sale as a ticket for a Chinese propaganda

147
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.690
film, and then wave you on through.

148
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.950
These reports are all independent, and there’s
no financial data reporting this, again, so

149
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.200
take it with a grain of salt, but it seems
to be reported... a lot.

150
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.640
In fact a lot of people who work in the industry
are pretty convinced that China fudges their

151
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.360
numbers all the time.

152
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.550
Avengers Endgame had been the biggest opening
weekend of all time at a domestic box office,

153
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.230
with 357 million dollars in the US, and Canada.

154
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.380
A record most industry professionals were
convinced wouldn’t be broken for years.

155
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.880
But then, earlier this year, Detective Chinatown
3 opened in China to a reported opening weekend

156
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.510
of 400 million dollars.

157
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.980
These numbers weren’t released by any studio
or production company, of course, they were

158
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.910
announced by CGTN, China’s Global Television
Network.

159
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.910
Basically their English Language propaganda
channel.

160
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.860
The news wasn’t even announced on local
Chinese news, only the English Language variant.

161
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.839
Making it pretty clear that it was a dick
wagging move, allowing the Chinese film industry

162
00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:50.800
— and by proxy the Chinese government — to
flex how well they were doing economically,

163
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.260
while most of the rest of the world’s cinemas
still stood empty because of COVID 19.

164
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.530
And since there’s no way for Hollywood studios
to confirm these numbers, they’re just forced

165
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.910
to take the Chinese government at its word.

166
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.670
So not only is Hollywood getting a fraction
of the money from China that they do from

167
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.050
the rest of the world, now China is basically
making the argument that while Hollywood apparently

168
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.630
needs China, China doesn’t need Hollywood.

169
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.680
In recent years Chinese audiences have also
shown a reticence to Hollywood movies, choosing

170
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.330
Chinese-produced films instead.

171
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.020
Leading to more and more domestic Chinese
films being produced, leading to fewer theatre

172
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.269
screens being available for Hollywood movies,
leading to even less money being made in China

173
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:34.230
by American studios.

174
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.140
Suddenly that 20% number isn’t sounding
all that great.

175
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.100
The Chinese Government, via their censorship
bureau, is also making it increasingly difficult

176
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.790
for Hollywood movies to get released in China
at all.

177
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.760
In November of 2016, China passed a law banning
content deemed harmful to the “dignity,

178
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.060
honor, and interests” of the People's Republic
and encouraging the promotion of “socialist

179
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.959
core values," approved by the National People's
Congress Standing Committee.

180
00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:04.660
So basically any movie that portrays China
in anything but the most glowing light will

181
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.339
be banned immediately.

182
00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:09.760
Studios began trying to get around this by
working with Chinese Production companies

183
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.260
to ensure that a movie would meet the specifications
set out by the government.

184
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.480
Such as Alibaba Pictures, Wanda Media, or
Legendary Entertainment… a company that

185
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.600
was originally an American company but after
years of investment from a Chinese production

186
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.389
house, Wanda Media, the American stakeholders
lost control of the company to the Chinese

187
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:29.389
investors.

188
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:33.870
Once Wanda Media reached 50% plus one of the
voting shares, they took control of the company

189
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.160
and fired the American executives.

190
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.949
But even when studios try to work with Chinese
producers, that doesn’t guarantee success.

191
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:45.930
It just leads to movies doing well in China,
with possibly inflated returns thanks to those

192
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.360
wonky ticket sellers I mentioned earlier.

193
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.339
But then... doing worse in the rest of the
world because everyone else sees the movie

194
00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:56.709
j**king off to the Chinese government and
is a bit… turned off.

195
00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.120
This has been happening especially obviously
with the Fast and the Furious franchise.

196
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:06.660
2017’s Fate of the Furious, a Chinese co-production,
made 226 million dollars in North America,

197
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.190
but 392 million in China.

198
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.779
Another was Alita Battle Angel, with 85 million
in the US, and 133 million China.

199
00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:20.540
Transformers: The Last Knight made 130 million
in the US, and 228 million in China.

200
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.990
This is becoming more and more common.

201
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.140
Meanwhile Hollywood, especially Disney, who
got spooked at how poorly the new Star Wars

202
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.110
movies did in China (which honestly was likely
because the original trilogy was never released

203
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.880
in the Middle Kingdom), have been trying to
make movies specifically for China.

204
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.350
The live action Mulan and Marvel’s Shang
Chi come to mind.

205
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.310
But Mulan only made 40 million dollars in
China, and Shang Chi, to this day, still hasn’t

206
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.700
been granted a release.

207
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.780
While not officially stated by the Chinese
government, it’s likely because the movie’s

208
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.160
star, Simu Liu, publicly spoke about how his
family fled China for Canada.

209
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.500
And China doesn’t want that kind of back
talk.

210
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.390
That’s also why, assumedly, Marvel hasn’t
balked at the gay relationship in Marvel’s

211
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.390
Eternals.

212
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.360
They’re not cutting it out for countries
in the middle east who demanded it, for the

213
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360
most part.

214
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.700
Those countries have since banned the movie.

215
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.820
They didn’t cut it out when Russia demanded
it.

216
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.320
They just ended up giving it an 18+ rating.

217
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.230
So why has Marvel grown such a back bone all
of the sudden?

218
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.230
Well.

219
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.930
Because The Eternals never even had a chance
to be released in China because director,

220
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.940
Chloe Zhao, who was born in Beijing, left
China to make movies in Hollywood.

221
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.100
An act China will not soon forget, and so
her movies are now verboten there.

222
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.610
So why worry about appeasing the Chinese government’s
backward policies on LGBT representation,

223
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.029
when you know it’s never going to get released
there anyway?

224
00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:42.000
And even if they did agree to release it,
who’s to say that they wouldn’t “sell”

225
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.630
you a ticket for Eternals but count the sale
for a domestic propaganda movie like The Battle

226
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:52.300
at Lake Chanjin, a war movie released in China
in September of this year.

227
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.350
About Chinese soldiers overcoming the odds
and defeating American troops in Korea.

228
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.540
It’s apparently grossed 858 million dollars
so far.

229
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.700
Just in China.

230
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.680
During a pandemic.

231
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.830
And is, as of now, the highest grossing movie
globally of 2021.

232
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.830
…Allegedly…

233
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.650
And maybe all of this is for the best.

234
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.829
Maybe once China is out of the equation, Hollywood
will lose its excuse for not creating more

235
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:15.959
LGBT characters.

236
00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:22.450
But the funny thing is, if the Chinese people
actually had a say in it… we’d probably

237
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:30.509
have more gay characters in movies than we
already do.

238
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:34.550
One of the things I notice a lot when this
topic comes up in comment sections (and really,

239
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.589
I can’t afford a therapist so at the very
least I need to stop going into the comment

240
00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:42.290
sections), is that people seem to think that
Chinese people are inherently homophobic.

241
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.780
That the very sight of two men kissing makes
them vomit in rage!

242
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.780
Well!

243
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.579
Have I got news for you, dear viewer.

244
00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:50.010
Have you ever heard of BL?

245
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:55.420
It’s the less creepy way of saying “Boys’
Love”, which is a genre of movie, tv show,

246
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.790
comic, and novel that’s taking parts of
the world by storm.

247
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.560
And one of those parts is China.

248
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.930
The government wouldn’t be instituting “no
gays in movies” laws if they weren’t seeing

249
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.930
gays popping up in a whole lot of other places.

250
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:07.959
So what is BL?

251
00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:10.279
Well, I’ll differ to an expert.

252
00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.070
According to Manga Planet:

253
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.190
“Originating in Japan, Boys’ Love or BL
is a literary genre or media depicting the

254
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.399
romance between male characters.

255
00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:24.690
Commonly referred to as “yaoi” by overseas
fans, from books to fan fiction, manga, anime,

256
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.750
and video games.

257
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.459
BL stories tend to be written mostly by women.

258
00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:32.060
Boys’ Love began as fan works by women fans.

259
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.540
Later in the 1980s, yaoi manga expanded from
fan groups to mainstream media via anime or

260
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.100
OVA (original video animation) adaptations.

261
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.740
Since then, Japan has produced yaoi media
through various platforms.”

262
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.500
The internet propelled the global growth and
popularity of Boys’ Love, as non-Japanese

263
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.790
fans were finally able to read translated
BL manga.

264
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.149
And one of the largest markets for it... was
China.

265
00:16:57.149 --> 00:17:01.670
Subtle gay dramas and love stories, adapted
from boys’ love webnovels, have become a

266
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.850
very lucrative business in China.

267
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:10.120
But even with the censorship laws, the appetite
for queer content is just too big to ignore.

268
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.330
A demand that comes mostly not from gay men,
mind you, but straight women.

269
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.600
At least eight shows adapted from novels with
boys’ love romances premiered in 2021 across

270
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.189
China’s major streaming platforms.

271
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:25.819
The stories range from historical-fantasy
action flicks to modern mystery thrillers

272
00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:27.740
and teenage melodramas.

273
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:33.520
Making and showing BL dramas in China is a
tightly wound tight rope act between the profit-driven

274
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.090
entertainment industry and the homophobic
censorship of the Xi Jinping regime.

275
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.420
In 2016, the hit teen series Addicted (also
known as Heroin), a drama with explicit gay

276
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.010
scenes premiered.

277
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.210
It grabbed the attention of the Chinese government’s
censors when it first aired in January of

278
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.210
that year.

279
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.899
The first episode garnered 10 million views
in the span of 24 hours setting the record

280
00:17:55.899 --> 00:18:00.750
of the highest number of views on the first
day in China's streaming television history.

281
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.260
In less than a month, the series reached over
100 million views.

282
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.980
It became a massive trending topic on Weibo,
basically Chinese Twitter, with the show’s

283
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.640
hashtag being viewed 849 million times.

284
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.120
But then on February 23, all episodes of the
show were removed from all Chinese video streaming

285
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.940
websites three episodes before the season
finale.

286
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.710
This was by the order of the NRTA, or National
Radio and Television Administration, due to

287
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.980
"the gay and explicit content".

288
00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.849
The show is now impossible to view or access
via mainland China’s internet.

289
00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:37.800
The last three episodes of the first season
were uploaded to YouTube a few days later

290
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.090
to make them accessible to viewers outside
of mainland China.

291
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.290
The censorship of the series sparked rampant
criticism.

292
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.720
Online discussions on Weibo with the hashtag
"removal of Addiction" received more than

293
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.210
110 million views within a day of its cancellation.

294
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.510
The Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine
even published articles about it.

295
00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.290
But despite the Chinese government’s best
efforts to erase the show from existence,

296
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.700
it’s gained a huge following outside of
The Middle Kingdom, and a second season is

297
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.020
coming soon, but production and distribution
will be done in Taiwan.

298
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.620
A country where the BL genre has become an
industry all by itself.

299
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.669
But I think that’s a different video.

300
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:18.420
In 2018, the sci-fi drama Guardian went offline
two months after its release, even though

301
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.609
the original gay romance storyline was re-written
as a friendship to try to appeal to the censors.

302
00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:27.619
They didn’t care about the rewrite though
because Chinese viewers were shipping the

303
00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:30.150
characters whether they were written gay or
not.

304
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.429
Before it was banned, Guardian had already
pulled in over a billion views.

305
00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:39.150
The potential for some serious money encouraged
companies to continue with the BL genre in

306
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:44.179
China, but with a more understated tone that
could possibly bypass the government censors.

307
00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:48.909
The 2019 fantasy series The Untamed, featuring
an unlikely bond between a man with magic

308
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:54.220
powers and a stoic prince, started an online
craze over the pair’s implicit romance.

309
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.669
But the show’s promotion focused on its
portrayal of Chinese traditional culture — a

310
00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:02.440
push consistent with Chinese Communist Party
propaganda.

311
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.980
The show was queer baity, but the novel on
which it was based certainly was not.

312
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.790
That featured a very explicit love story between
the two main characters, but was self-censored

313
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.060
when adapted to meet the censorship guidelines
of the Xi Jinping government.

314
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.560
But it didn’t matter.

315
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.620
Like so much queer baiting before, people
saw through the weak venere of heterosexuality.

316
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.520
They took the bait, so to speak.

317
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.530
The series has accumulated a total of 9.5
billion views in China, as of this summer,

318
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.710
and had also received an international release
via Netflix.

319
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:38.580
It was described as a global phenomenon, taking
off like no BL series before it.

320
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.030
Making its way all around Asia and, with the
Netflix deal, all across Europe and North

321
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.240
America as well.

322
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.429
TenCent, the Chinese streaming platform it
originated on saw 2.6 million new subscribers

323
00:20:48.429 --> 00:20:50.430
to the service when it was released.

324
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:55.340
And WeTV, an app that lets you watch BL content
anywhere in the world, saw growth of 250%

325
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.880
while the show was airing.

326
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.179
In January 2020, the cast members planned
to embark on a multi-city worldwide fan meetings

327
00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:03.179
tour.

328
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:08.940
Cities included Bangkok, Singapore, Tokyo,
Seoul, Macau, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto, Los Angeles,

329
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.609
New York, but it was cancelled due to COVID19.

330
00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:14.830
Even the Chinese government has endorsed it.

331
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.720
The overseas popularity of these romantic
sword-wielding heroes is often highlighted

332
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.890
in Chinese media coverage, focusing in on
the massive overseas streaming numbers and

333
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.899
its ability to build a growing appreciation
for the charm of Chinese culture.

334
00:21:27.899 --> 00:21:31.960
Meanwhile, production houses and streaming
sites have snapped up the adaptation rights

335
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.650
of other popular BL novels.

336
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.310
Priest, author of Guardian and Word of Honor,
will see at least four more of her novels

337
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.860
adapted into live action series or movies.

338
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.419
Knowing viewers jokingly call the homoerotic
relationships in these dramas “socialist

339
00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:50.379
brotherhoods,” a reference to how on-screen
homosexuality has to be disguised as bromances

340
00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:52.360
in line with official state ideology.

341
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.710
I’m surprised that moniker hasn’t been
taken up by some of my subscribers, to be

342
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.710
honest.

343
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.970
But the rise of BL in China, sadly, doesn’t
mean the Chinese government is going to soften

344
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.420
its stance on LGBTQ rights anytime soon.

345
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.740
For all its appeal to homoeroticism, the BL
business in China survives by avoiding any

346
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.920
discussion of these rights while focusing
on the physical attractiveness of its male

347
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
characters.

348
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.790
Ge Liang, a researcher at King’s College
London said:

349
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.910
“By hinting at male homoerotic love, the
directors and actors are appropriating the

350
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.780
interest of… gay life, trying to turn these
into cash and traffic.

351
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.441
But instead of speaking up for the LGBTQ community,
they stay in line with China’s official

352
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:34.480
policy on gay people: ‘keep them silent
and keep them sinful.’”

353
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.230
Most gay people in China still face prevalent
discrimination in households, schools, and

354
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.230
workplaces.

355
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:45.330
But these struggles are invisible to the public
eye, as state censors ban almost all representation

356
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.060
of obvious homosexuality in mass media.

357
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.090
In 2018, a writer was sentenced to more than
10 years in jail for writing and selling gay

358
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.090
erotica.

359
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.700
However, some members of the gay community
see BL dramas as a precious platform for queer

360
00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700
stories.

361
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.610
Where Chinese state media often portrays gay
men as enemies to traditional values, and

362
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:09.220
sources of social instability, subtle BL dramas
have perhaps become the best form of queer

363
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.520
representation in China’s state-sanctioned
pop culture.

364
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.500
But in March of this year, just as new series
Word of Honor earned an impressive score of

365
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:23.100
8.6 out of 10 on review site Douban, an op-ed
published via the state-run News Agency warned

366
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.750
against the “negative influence” of BL
on impressionable teenagers.

367
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.790
Many feared this signalled an imminent crackdown
on the genre.

368
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.790
And then…

369
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.470
The Chinese Government officially banned any
representation of men in media that did not

370
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.640
fit perfectly within the ideal of masculinity.

371
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.820
No more bromances.

372
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.060
No more coding.

373
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.700
No more lingering looks or soft touches.

374
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.929
President Xi Jinping has called for a ‘national
rejuvenation,’ with tighter Communist Party

375
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:54.250
control of business, education, culture, and
religion.

376
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:59.000
Companies and the public are under increasing
pressure to align with its vision for a more

377
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.270
powerful China.

378
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:06.760
Which… if you look to your history books,
when a country starts locking down the media

379
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.349
and attacking a very specific minority group
as being the propagator of all the nation’s

380
00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:16.810
ails, as the Chinese government is now doing
with what they describe as ‘sissy men’...

381
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:27.950
That usually means the government is on the
ropes, whether we see it publicly or not.

382
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.820
Someone might be asking: well why is the Chinese
government so obsessed with clamping down

383
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.560
on removing gay representation — from their
media?

384
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.929
Why does any political body specifically target
a removal of queerness from media?

385
00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:42.640
It seems to be kind of a weird and arbitrary
thing to hate on, right?

386
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.440
If you wanted a strong natoional sense of
unity, why would you specifically target one

387
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:53.010
group of people — specifically a group of
people that cannot be culturally erased because

388
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.500
more gay babies are born every day.

389
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.000
You could argue that the reason is because
a totalitarian state is interested in population

390
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.050
expansion.

391
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.480
Queer people can be seen as a population limmiter.

392
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.399
Especially if a nation is engaged in expansionism
or involved in regular military conflicts.

393
00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:14.730
But when it comes to China… they have population
control mandates.

394
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.889
As well as the fact that The People’s Army
isn’t publicly engaged in any hot conflicts

395
00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:20.889
right now.

396
00:25:20.889 --> 00:25:25.880
As well as it would simply just be easier
to have mandatory in-vetro pregnancies for

397
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.679
lesbian women, and mandatory sperm domantions
from gay men.

398
00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:35.190
Alternatively, you could argue that many totalitarian
regimes tend to lean on scripture and religious

399
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.919
doctrine as a means of controlling a population.

400
00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:41.660
There’s no better way to get someone to
live their life a certain way, than by telling

401
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.400
them they're going to go to hell if they don't.

402
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400
For all eternity.

403
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.869
Or better yet, dangle afterlife rewards programs
in front of them.

404
00:25:48.869 --> 00:25:53.620
As it so happens, gay people aren’t really
compatible with MOST modern religions in the

405
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.620
world…

406
00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:00.690
But China is a Maoist Communist state, and
as a result has banned most religious practices.

407
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.310
Dictatorial theocracies are kind of hit and
miss control method though, because what inevitably

408
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.290
happens is one group of extremists pop up
and declare that another group isn’t being

409
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.810
extremist enough.

410
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.410
And splintering is what regimes like the one
in China tend to avoid.

411
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:20.450
Keep in mind the methodology of control in
a dictatorship is to unify public, military,

412
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.220
and commercial thought into a single national
direction that all feeds into consolidating

413
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.900
the power of the dictator.

414
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.020
The reason why Soviet communism banned religion
was because they recognized that not only

415
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.220
did religious freedom afford opportunities
for diverting power away from the state, but

416
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.380
also created a precedent for there to be power
above the state.

417
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.010
And if a religious figure can convince you
that God wants you to defy the state, then

418
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.290
the state is in trouble.

419
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.440
You only really see theocracies in smaller
countries, both in terms of population and

420
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.240
sheer geographical size.

421
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.870
In order to assure that the people associate
the religious order with state mandate, you

422
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.929
usually need a strong martial presence.

423
00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:03.010
Which is much harder to organize in a significantly
large nation.

424
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:07.440
This should illustrate just how delicate dictatorships
actually are.

425
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.061
In order for the state to function, everybody
in the nation needs to be doing what the state

426
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.930
wants them to do.

427
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.190
Given that the state is meant to function
as a well-oiled machine, there isn’t a whole

428
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.980
lot of slack for, say, a workers strike.

429
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.530
Take this however you want, but... if your
economy tells you that it can’t possibly

430
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:28.790
survive a workers strike, you just might be
in a totalitarian regime.

431
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.899
In most cases, having a nation that is divided
in its thinking means that the state has a

432
00:27:32.899 --> 00:27:36.099
diminished capacity to predict and plan the
movements of its own people.

433
00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:37.929
It’s also just more efficient.

434
00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:42.139
If you’re going to the gas station for a
slushie run, it’s easiest if your 10 friends

435
00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:43.990
all like blue.

436
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.200
But if your friends all want something different,
you’re going to need go in with a list.

437
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.359
Or, you could just tell everyone that blue
is the only colour available.

438
00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:55.909
If it’s the only colour they think is available,
of course it’s going to be their choice.

439
00:27:55.909 --> 00:28:01.149
Complete unity is the objective – it’s
difficult to control a billion people.

440
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:06.150
But it is much easier to control one culture
shared by a billion people.

441
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.300
The stronger the cohesion to a singular culture,
the easier it is for the state to plan and

442
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.200
predict social, economic, and cultural movements.

443
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.330
So how does all of this relate to gay censorship?

444
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.910
Consider how much of our society is built
around different milestones of life.

445
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.570
When you graduate from high school.

446
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.570
When you get married.

447
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:23.570
When you buy a house.

448
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:24.960
When you start having children.

449
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:30.280
A lot of us don’t even realize these are
milestones, and we don’t even realize they’re

450
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280
optional.

451
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.369
All those articles about how millennials are
destroying the housing industry because we’re

452
00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:38.879
not buying houses, the car industry because
we live in cities and take public transit,

453
00:28:38.879 --> 00:28:43.159
the napkin industry because we use paper towels,
or the diamond industry because we’re not

454
00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:45.200
getting married as young as we used to.

455
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.460
Those are based on these expectations about
how people are ‘supposed’ to act.

456
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.830
Not feeding into these industries when we
were expected to is a huge disruption in how

457
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.070
these respective industries project what their
profits will be.

458
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.800
Now take China, and instead of picturing many
different industries, see China itself as

459
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.880
an industry.

460
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.990
In order for China to function, the state
needs as many people in the nation as humanly

461
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.970
possible to conform to a very specific collection
of roles and identities.

462
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.120
The more people deviate from that singular
identity, the less control the Chinese government

463
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.429
has to properly manage those people.

464
00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:25.619
And that’s why queer people, by nature,
challenge the state’s ability to expect

465
00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:28.320
and predict the behaviour of it’s people.

466
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.909
In our modern society, queer people have existed
on the fringe of society for thousands of

467
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:34.909
years.

468
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:39.490
As a quasi-legal, sometimes entirely illegal
class of people, we mostly don’t feel a

469
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.760
need to conform to social standards and milestones.

470
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.250
There’s no reason to get married in your
early 20s because getting married at all wasn’t

471
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.790
an option.

472
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.900
Queer people, thus, don’t need to buy a
house in the suburbs to have children.

473
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.480
We don’t need cars if we live in the inner
city.

474
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480
Domestic appliances?

475
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.730
We’re cooking for one.

476
00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.560
We didn’t get engaged, so we don’t — or
we didn’t used to — buy rings.

477
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.020
Take a moment to consider how disastrous this
is to a society that is constructed around

478
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.139
buying things at certain times in your life,
under certain expectations of how you ought

479
00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:10.139
to live.

480
00:30:10.139 --> 00:30:14.770
And not only that, but each queer person can
have a vastly different set of expiriences

481
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.609
from the next and therefor gravitate to different
lifestyles.

482
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:21.940
Queer people — within ourselves — lack
unity as a subdemographic.

483
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.510
For a governing body which requires a homogenous
population in order to consolidate power,

484
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.839
we are a bit of a nightmare.

485
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:33.780
And it’s for this reason, neither baby making
nor religious bigotry, that China in particular

486
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.409
clamps down on queer people.

487
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:41.220
Increasing the available ‘accepted’ identities
in a given society adds an incredible layer

488
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.270
of complexity when it comes to managing how
this population ought to behave.

489
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:52.190
One unified culture means that this one culture
only needs one media stream to project messages

490
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.190
toward.

491
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.860
A state-sanctioned heterosexual romantic comedy
which contains pro-state messaging will be

492
00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.590
received and absorbed by straight people — because
they want a relationship like the main characters

493
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.110
have, they model their life after the main
characters.

494
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:12.240
(This is in incredibly simplified terms but
you would be amazed at how easily media can

495
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.050
influence your actions, so this isn’t much
of a stretch.)

496
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:20.220
If queerness is an acceptable identity, then
queer people are not going to identify with

497
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.610
that messaging in that heterosexual rom com.

498
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.670
Then the state needs to make a separate media
stream to accommodate queer people — a media

499
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:30.580
stream that will not be absorbed by straight
audiences.

500
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.290
In a pragmatic sense, the state is spending
twice as much money to project the same pro-state

501
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.139
messaging to two different audiences.

502
00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:41.640
How old should gay people be when they get
married versus how old should straight people

503
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640
be?

504
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.800
Synchronising both of these messages and assuring
that they both feed into state power consolidation

505
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.409
is quite a task.

506
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:54.899
And far less efficient than projecting one
message to one homogeneous social group.

507
00:31:54.899 --> 00:32:00.360
Limiting the available identities that a citizen
can occupy is totalitarian regime 1-0-1.

508
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.220
That dates back to the earliest empires.

509
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.260
Rome, for instance, owed its success in no
small part to a very rigid, very narrow, range

510
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.530
of gender identities, family roles, and a
very limited class mobility.

511
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:16.359
As the state could trust that a Roman man
in Italia would hold the same social values

512
00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:21.810
as a Roman man in Germania, they could plan
and predict how large sections of provinces

513
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.200
would respond to legislation and taxation.

514
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.040
As it so happened, same-sex intimacy wasn’t
strictly incompatible with Roman family structures.

515
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.300
But Rome also entirely demanded slave labour
to function so maybe this isn’t a fantastic

516
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.680
social model to look up to.

517
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.820
And it’s not like gay persecution is limited
to “left wing” totalitarianism.

518
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.500
China is undergoing a similar process to America
in the 1950s.

519
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.830
A very pro-free market, pro-white, pro-straight
process that came to be known as McCarthyism,

520
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.750
named after senator Joseph McCarthy.

521
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.670
The legacy of McCarthyist crackdowns was an
intended plot to root out any communist or

522
00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:59.139
socialist ideology from America, under the
guise of rooting out Soviet spies.

523
00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:01.010
Which… was not all that successful.

524
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:05.130
They caught a lot of people who fed information
to spies… but they didn’t actually catch

525
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.780
a lot of those actual soviet sleeper agents.

526
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:14.320
In reality, McCarthyism was an effort to distinguish
the cultural identity of ‘propper American’

527
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320
people.

528
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.470
This is when you got all those info-videos
about how to live your life, which got weirdly

529
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.470
specific.

530
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.470
How to hold a family meeting.

531
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.470
How to be a popular teenager.

532
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.810
How to go to the store.

533
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:40.120
To say nothing of sexual education manuals
directed to young women.

534
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.760
Anyone who behaved like the people in the
videos was a proper American.

535
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.540
Those who did not were possibly ‘communists’
and should be reported to the authorities

536
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.540
for investigation.

537
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.000
At the time, America was convinced that their
capitalist way of life was under constant

538
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.780
threat, and were informed by the government
that even one ‘non American’ living in

539
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.840
your neighbourhood could be a threat to national
social cohesion.

540
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.429
But McCarthyism didn’t stick in America,
simply because singular power consolidation

541
00:34:07.429 --> 00:34:12.159
was conflicting with American party-politics,
freedom of religion, and the free market which

542
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:17.909
began to capitalize on artistic formats which
McCarthy considered to be non-American.

543
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.570
Black music and art, gay men in hollywood,
women in publishing.

544
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.730
There were simply too many channels of media
for the state to regulate and countermand.

545
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:30.359
The Chinese government’s saving grace, thus
far, had been the proverbial iron curtain

546
00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:33.149
that separated global media from Chinese audiences.

547
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:38.639
The state can control what media the public
receives, the state can dictate what a ‘proper

548
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.770
citizen’ is.

549
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.350
This is why Hong Kong was such a problem ($ubt!tle$
8locked)

550
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.700
So it’s not like China is deliberately opening
their captured audience to the rest of the

551
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.700
world.

552
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.580
It’s just getting easier for the media to
move fluidly across borders without a government’s

553
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.580
consent.

554
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.130
Chinese creators who travel abroad may return
to China with fresh perspectives and want

555
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.900
to include facets of life beyond what is strictly
sanctioned by the Chinese government.

556
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.360
And as the government cracks down on representation,
they find more clever ways to code it into

557
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.730
the media, while still checking off all the
other boxes for praising the state.

558
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:09.830
Like The Untamed.

559
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:15.200
But for some reason, even coding queerness
is too much for China now though.

560
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.240
As I’ve said, Chinese law about representation,
specifically in line with gender roles and

561
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:30.110
expressions of masculinity, have strange implications.

562
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:36.380
Right now, actors and creators from South
Korea, Japan, Australia, and even China are

563
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:42.050
flocking to Taiwan and Thailand, which right
now stand at the dual seats of a media empire

564
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.950
for producing BL content.

565
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.330
Comics, novels, movies, television shows.

566
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.850
There is so much BL media coming out of Taiwan
and Thailand, that you need a website catalogue

567
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.020
to track it all.

568
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.250
And there’s plenty coming from other Asian
countries as well, but Taiwan and Thailand

569
00:35:55.250 --> 00:36:00.390
seem to be pumping out BL content faster than
Disney pumps out Star Wars and Marvel combined.

570
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:04.260
China shares a lot of cultural identity and
history with these countries too… broadly

571
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.260
speaking.

572
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.740
And given the massive amounts of cash that
China hands out through its arts programs,

573
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.900
you’d think that China itself would want
to capitalize on BL the way Thailand and Taiwan

574
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.900
have.

575
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.000
The international outreach would be positive,
and ultimately garnish a lot of goodwill from

576
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.690
queer audiences, for softening their pespective
of China and Maoism.

577
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.480
Not to mention the financial return.

578
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.510
So why is China not engaging?

579
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.580
Because control over their own population
is more beneficial to the legacy and stability

580
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.420
of the state.

581
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.890
A citizen may ask: “If it’s suddenly okay
to be gay… what else is okay?”

582
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.510
And it may very well be that the people of
China are starting to ask those kinds of questions.

583
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.730
China’s new media laws — which also apply
to forigen media shown in China — crackdown

584
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.630
on gender roles in a way that is both specific
and very generalized.

585
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.060
For instance, a man cannot be depicted as
effeminate in any way now.

586
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.360
Which is always difficult to gauge because
there’s a question of what kind of man are

587
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.440
you talking about?

588
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.130
Is this man sensitive enough to hug his children?

589
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.130
Does he cry?

590
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.130
Does he cook?

591
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.580
We know that two men touching in any way is
strictly off-limits.

592
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:14.830
And given how successful China’s subtle
approach to censoring gay content has been…

593
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.330
this seems a bit heavy handed.

594
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.980
Or… maybe it isn’t as successful as we
believe.

595
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.030
I’ve met a few gay men from China, both
online and in real life.

596
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:28.040
And when it comes to the topic of queer acceptance
in mainland China, I’ve been told it’s

597
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.860
more or less an ambivilant issue.

598
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.720
No, it’s not strictly socially accepted,
but homophobia is more about not wanting your

599
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.340
own children to be gay — because of legacy
— but no effort seems to be given to open

600
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.470
bigotry toward gay people in general.

601
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.120
And bear in mind, this is… absolutely not
an adequate sample size to gauge the overall

602
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.340
attitude of queerness in mainland China.

603
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.880
And is focused mostly on cultural attitudes
in urban centres.

604
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.340
And also limited by the individual perspectives
of the people I’ve spoken to, and the kind

605
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.670
of people that I am likely to encounter.

606
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:02.260
So take this less as hard statistics and more
of a glimpse into the possibility that we,

607
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.650
in the rest of the world, may not have the
clearest idea of what the Chinese people,

608
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.940
themselves, are comfortable with.

609
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.480
To say nothing of the… throbbing statistics
that demonstrate very clearly that the Chinese

610
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.560
people are comfortable enough — with at
least gay men — to fully support BL content...

611
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.100
when it has been produced.

612
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.990
Because the new crackdowns on identity tell
me that something very precarious is going

613
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:27.180
on in China — and that the government is
struggling to maintain social unity.

614
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.160
They’re seeing splinters and groups which
lean towards inclusive lifestyles.

615
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.880
That they see the people becoming comfortable
with fragmenting subcultures.

616
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.320
And so in a nation where the state controls
all media in the hopes that they can use media

617
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.530
to control the people, they are placing much
tighter constraints about what messaging the

618
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.160
media can depict.

619
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.140
In other nations which influenced the population
with propaganda, this was always a red flag...

620
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.100
that the culture of the people was developing
in a way that did not align with the state’s

621
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.100
agenda.

622
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.060
And Hollywood is just another shred of evidence.

623
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:04.040
As Chinese laws become tighter and tighter
about what kinds of depictions of men can

624
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.190
be screened in China, Hollywood is going to
have fewer and fewer films that are going

625
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.100
to be able to qualify.

626
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.220
Not to mention, more competition with Chinese
films, fewer screens in Chinese cinemas, and

627
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.790
a smaller and smaller cut of the Chinese box
office.

628
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.870
The rest of the so-called ‘modern world’
is pushing for more diversity.

629
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.200
For a deconstruction of typical gender roles.

630
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.900
So Chinese interests of the state are putting
Hollywood in a very strange situation: conform

631
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.550
entirely to Chinese demand for the chance
that China will, first of all, screen your

632
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.800
movie, and second of all, report accurate
box office numbers.

633
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.230
Or…

634
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:46.130
Hollywood studios can simply make movies for
(most of) the rest of the world.

635
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.420
I think that we, the queers of every damn
country on this planet, should take pride

636
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.790
in the fact that in a lot of cases in the
last thousand years, the big focus of crumbling

637
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.050
fascistic regimes was also queer people.

638
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.820
We’re a bunch of homos living our lives,
and yet we represent one of the single most

639
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.260
pivotal disruptions to dictatorships.

640
00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.570
Shouldn’t it be an awesome feeling that
we have that kind of power to automatically

641
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.090
disrupt authoritarian control?

642
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:17.390
That our very existence runs so antithetical
to a government controlling its people that

643
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.720
they have to turn propaganda into a science
to suppress us?

644
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.570
They’d never admit that we have that kind
of power but their actions say otherwise.

645
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.570
Every morning when you wake up and go about
your queer life, you are inherently shaking

646
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.090
the foundation on which dictatoriships are
built.

647
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:38.230
Because they have shown that totalitarianism
cannot exist when queer people exist alongside

648
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.230
it.

649
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:44.550
But unlike fascists and dictators, we don’t
fall.

650
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:48.840
No matter what the church, or politicians,
or world leaders say…

651
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.050
We remain.

652
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.700
When Rome fell, we were still there.

653
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:58.450
When the church started losing influence,
we were still there.

654
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:03.260
When the fabled thousand-year-Reich collapsed,
we were still there.

655
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:11.580
And when this anti-queer Chinese government
sees its last days, we will still be there.

656
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.090
We’ve always been here.

657
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:19.700
We’re always going to be here.

658
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:26.220
Remember that.
