00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.480
Hey everyone!
Before we start the video I just  

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.320
wanted to thank everyone whose contributed 
to the Telos Pictures IndieGoGo campaign.  

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
If you don’t know Telos Pictures is a production 
company myself and a group of other LGBTQ artists  

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.440
are creating to produce high quality LGBTQ 
movies and series made for LGBTQ people. No  

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.520
gay best friends, no coming out stories, 
no “the queer dies at the end” stories.  

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.280
If you want more info, I’ve left a link to 
the campaign in the description of this video.  

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.440
Since this is the last video I’ll be releasing 
before the end of the campaign I just wanted to  

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.880
get it out there one more time. Okay. 
Now on to our feature presentation.

9
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.480
I’ve always found it interesting that economically 
disenfranchised people, also known as poor people  

10
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.800
when you’re not trying to make it sound better, 
have a very love-hate relationship with the rich.  

11
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
You’d think it would be pure hate, seeing as how 
the rich tend to use the poor in any number of  

12
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.200
horrible ways. But there is an odd attraction 
to the rich set, especially the filthy rich.

13
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.800
When it comes to media we’re not that interested 
in seeing those who describe themselves as  

14
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.880
comfortable or upper middle class. Because 
those people, who tend to make high six to  

15
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.640
low seven figure salaries a year, 
know how to keep themselves hidden.

16
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280
They don’t flaunt their wealth in ways that 
stand out from anyone else in a gated suburb.  

17
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.400
Two cars, maybe? Perfect green 
lawn? Pool in the backyard?  

18
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.880
Nothing too extraordinary. Nothing 
worth making a tv show about, at least.

19
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.160
But the filthy rich, well, they just can’t 
help but broadcast how much money they’ve got.  

20
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.040
Yachts, multiple houses, fancy cars, diamond 
engagement rings the size of the hope diamond.

21
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.120
Trips to space.

22
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560
When you’ve got it, flaunt it! Right?

23
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.280
And we poors and working class folks 
find that fascinating, I think.  

24
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.160
At least I do. That the richest of the rich 
feel so comfortable that they can’t imagine  

25
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.800
something like a, say, French Revolution 
happening. We wouldn’t even need to research  

26
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.920
who to take to the gallows, they literally 
publish their wealth on an annual basis.

27
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
And I think they feel this safety 
because they feel us lower classes  

28
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
fawning over them in fictional media. 
Prime time soaps of the 1980s like Dallas,  

29
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.735
Dynasty, and Falcon Crest. Teen dramas 
like Gossip Girl. Outlandishly best  

30
00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:48.240
selling novels like those written 
by Danielle Steele and Kevin Kwan.

31
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.520
We eat up the lifestyles of the rich and famous, 
and I think that gives them a sense of security.  

32
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.520
Because this media shows them as rich, yes, 
but also fallible. They’re stressed out,  

33
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.200
emotionally unstable, and unable to keep their 
lives together. Just like us. So this media shows  

34
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.560
us that, but for a few extra zeroes at the end of 
their bank balances, we’re no different, really.

35
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.560
But lately that addiction to watching 
the rich has mostly dissipated.  

36
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.520
The Real Housewives of insert city here are still 
fabulously popular, or infamous, but media about  

37
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.160
rich people isn’t nearly as ubiquitous as it 
once was. Except for shows like Billions and  

38
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.240
Succession or movies like The Wolf of Wall Street 
where the rich are absolutely not good people.

39
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.320
But there does seem to be a caveat to that. 
We do still love watching media about the rich  

40
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440
if they aren’t just rich… but royal. 
The Crown is a good example. But I’m  

41
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.640
not here to talk about Queen Elizabeth 
and what that family did to Diana.  

42
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.120
I’m here to talk about a little 
Netflix show called Young Royals.

43
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.400
Young Royals is a Netflix drama series 
focusing on Prince Willhelm of Sweden,  

44
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.960
the younger of two royal sons. After a video 
tape of him getting into a scuffle in a club  

45
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.600
goes viral, the Royal Family is keen to 
paint him as an out-of-control delinquent  

46
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720
who needs to get shipped off to 
the country for boarding school.

47
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.120
So, off to Hilerska boarding school 
he goes… like it’s a prison sentence.

48
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.960
His brother, the crown prince pulls 
up in a Ferrari to see him off. We,  

49
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.560
the audience, are dragged through 
Willhelm’s discomfort as he poses  

50
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.680
for photo ops and is greeted 
by the entire school staff.

51
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.680
It’s clear that Willhelm 
doesn’t like being on camera.  

52
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.240
He doesn’t like performing, and he doesn’t 
like the posturing required of the monarchy.  

53
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.360
The pomp and circumstance grates against his 
authenticity. The ‘royal life’ is already in  

54
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.000
opposition to who he is and how he wants 
to express himself in the first episode.

55
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.240
He’s not like other Royals.

56
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.280
The storm clouds raining 
on his parade part briefly  

57
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.200
when the school rolls out 
a… choir… for his arrival.

58
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.120
OH THE HORRORS OF BIRTHRIGHT.

59
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.880
And it’s love at first sight when 
Willhelm lays eyes on Simon, who,  

60
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.120
as the soloist, enchants Willhelm. 
And who would not be enchanted?

61
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.520
The majority of the show focuses around Willhelm 
and Simon, and the development of their teenage  

62
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.360
courtship. In spite of the whole… love at first 
sight thing — I have to say I really appreciate  

63
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.240
how earnest the show is in it’s depiction of 
teenage gay boys trying to figure out how to  

64
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.880
make this whole ‘relationship’ thing work. 
Nothing is particularly sensationalised.

65
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.800
Instead you have two awkward kids with 
hormones pouring out of their ears  

66
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.320
trying really hard not to stare at each other.

67
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.760
Problem: Simon is not rich. In fact, Simon 
is depicted as perhaps on the poor side  

68
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.840
of middle class. He and his sister are 
attending Hilerska through scholarships  

69
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.320
and are not boarding at the school, but 
instead have to bus to and from every day.

70
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.280
Especially with Simon, there is a heap of 
friction between him and the other boys at school,  

71
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.080
who come from money. And by ‘come 
from money’ I mean — getting together,  

72
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.840
bragging about how much land their 
family estates have and popping pills.

73
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.840
Through the duration of this first season, 
we see the struggles Willhelm and Simon  

74
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.000
face as they try to express their feelings 
for eachother. And at almost every turn,  

75
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.760
Willhelm feels like his Royal responsibilities 
prevent him and Simon from being together.

76
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.560
Which results in, about twice per episode, Wilhelm 
flip-flopping back and forth on whether he wants  

77
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.480
to be with Simon. “Oh I like you,” but “oh I need 
you to delete my number,” but “oh hey you should  

78
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.640
spend the weekend with me.” I mean who doesn’t 
want to be pursued by a handsome prince, but this  

79
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.120
boy is waving heart-shaped red flags in Simon’s 
face like it’s valentine's day for the indecisive.

80
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.440
And it’s definitely clear that the 
show wants to use this ‘two worlds  

81
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.040
collide’ romance in order to open a 
discussion about wealth inequality,  

82
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.720
but there’s very little in 
the way of worlds colliding.

83
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.680
Granted, it IS nice that 
you don’t have a rich person  

84
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.520
staring down their nose at the poor 
and asking: “what’s a microwave?”

85
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.520
Though the show does go out of its way 
to describe SOME kind of class dynamic,  

86
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.080
at times heavy-handedly, I feel like this 
is more out of a sense of obligation.  

87
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.720
You have a literal love-at-first sight fairytale, 
a kind of queer adaptation of Cinderella.  

88
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.040
And If you want to write that in this day and age,  

89
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.720
there is going to be a question about the 
wealth discrepancy hanging over the plot.

90
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.440
But aside from the lack of fancy food, 
which bothers Simon’s sister Sara to no end,  

91
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.520
the poors don’t really have to face 
a whole lot of struggles from their  

92
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.120
economic situation. We know Simon’s family is 
struggling, but we don’t know to what extent.

93
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.840
Actually, while we may see the 
poors struggle because they’re poor,  

94
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.560
we only really see the riches 
suffer… because they’re rich.

95
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.080
…Hear me out.

96
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.120
As the show primarily follows Willhelm’s POV,  

97
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.520
we, the audience, are most empathetically 
drawn to his emotional development.

98
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.080
His drama seems to arise from all of the ways 
that being a royal is an obstacle. With the  

99
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.880
exception of the death of his brother, his 
suffering is almost entirely linked to him  

100
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.840
being wealthy. The show goes to great lengths 
to describe how and why we should empathise,  

101
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.520
maybe even pity this literal 
prince, BECAUSE he’s a prince.

102
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.920
From the very clear neglect and distance he 
feels from his parents, the strain of having  

103
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.800
to do things he does not want to do, struggling 
to keep what he wants at arms’ length because  

104
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.080
he knows he will not be allowed to have it, to 
being manipulated and hazed by other rich boys.

105
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.305
Hazing is illegal for a lot of reasons, due in 
part to the fact that — at best — they are non  

106
00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:26.960
consensual rituals of humiliation and establishing 
power structures. Or as some would say  

107
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.200
‘boys being boys.’

108
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.720
And while Willhelm does not consent 
to this, within the first episode,  

109
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.520
it’s made very clear that he would not be 
in this situation if he were not wealthy.

110
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.640
And while the overall plot of the 
show is weaved together out of a  

111
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.920
number of other issues affecting 
the other principal characters,  

112
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.400
Willhelm’s emotional state is always brought 
to the forefront. From what I can tell,  

113
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.000
it seems as if the show is making the 
statement that Willhem’s stunted emotional  

114
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.600
growth is due specifically to his birthright 
and responsibilities as a Prince of Sweden.

115
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.640
It is, after all, the crown that prevents him 
from living as he choses. It is the crown which  

116
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.280
forces him into this school. And then it 
is the crown that forces him to publicly  

117
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.880
deny the existence of a relationship with 
Simon, even after a sex tape is leaked.

118
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.840
If only there was a poor who could 
understand… an emotional support poor if  

119
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.400
you will… who could help him find a reason 
to sort through all of his emotional BS.

120
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.360
Does Simon have his crap together…? I mean 
honestly, he has the emotional intelligence  

121
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.200
to spot red flags and put distance 
between him and someone he slept with so…  

122
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.000
that’s already leagues ahead 
of most teenagers. And me.

123
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.840
Simon’s conflict doesn’t really stem from 
his own emotional ties — he struggles with  

124
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.440
Willhelm’s emotions. But his role, as this is 
fiction crafted by authors who have intent,  

125
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.640
is to look cute and benefit 
from Willhelm's emotional state.

126
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.080
I wasn’t being flippant when I said that this 
was a Cinderella story, it’s just flipped almost  

127
00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.440
entirely in the opposite direction. The Cinderella 
figure is Willhelm, who longs to escape his world  

128
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.440
of fabulous wealth, and you have Simon, who is the 
escape from that rigid and emotionally negligent  

129
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.200
world. Simon is the pauper prince charming in this 
version of the fairytail, not the prince himself.

130
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.800
Wilmhelm has money, but in order for 
him to become a functioning human being,  

131
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.520
he needs someone to help him navigate all 
the emotions he’s not allowed to have.

132
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.440
Enter the poor person, for whom 
emotional intelligence is in abundance.  

133
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.960
Simon’s family life is almost a 
night-and-day foil to Willhelm.  

134
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.400
Little in the way of expendable income, 
but wealth in emotions, and having an open,  

135
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.160
honest line of dialogue with his mother. She loves 
him, cares about him, and wants him to be happy.  

136
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.600
His gayness is never an issue with her because 
her son’s emotions, his happiness, come first.

137
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.560
Simon has the only thing money can’t buy — a good 
home. So if emotions are money, it’s Simon who is  

138
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.200
the emotionally liberated prince who 
needs to sweep Willhelm off HIS feet.

139
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.680
One may say that this is an interesting flip…

140
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.560
But in Wealth-centric propaganda fiction, 
the glorification of poverty isn’t exactly  

141
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.960
new. And based on how successful it is, I 
can’t see it going away any time soon. We  

142
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.160
see a lot of media popping up about how hard 
it is to be wealthy, and especially Royal.  

143
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.040
How the responsibility of privilege weighs 
down so much that it crushes the individual.

144
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.200
This is the focus and topic of The Crown.  

145
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.600
Taking the royals and showcasing their most 
public moments — taking care to explain that  

146
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.880
these people WOULD be decent human beings 
IF ONLY they did not have so many burdens.  

147
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.280
That obligation stifles the ability to be human 
and begets more suffering across generations.

148
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.600
There are a number of instances but the 
clearest to me is in Season 3 Episode 6,  

149
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.120
where Prince Charles is sent to a 
school he does not want to go to  

150
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.840
so he can fulfil a royal obligation that 
his family has arranged against his wishes.

151
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.520
Charles has to spend time with a 
LOWLY professor and his family.  

152
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.000
At which point the professor’s wife remarks 
how sad Charles makes her. How he looks at  

153
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.960
them and their child as if he’s never received 
so much as a pat on the head from his parents.

154
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:10.240
Again, reinforcing the concept that the poor have 
a greater wealth of authentic life that the rich  

155
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.520
could never buy for themselves. 
And this media’s message  

156
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.280
is that the Rich NEED the poor 
to help them sort out their crap.

157
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.360
Look at Crazy Rich Asians, where 
the Young family NEEDS a poor woman  

158
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.600
to stand up to the bullying family matriarch. 
You have a similar setup in Eddie Murphy’s  

159
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.840
Coming to America. Or Gone With the Wind, where 
a fallen-from-grace plantation owner literally  

160
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.640
cannot function on a base human level without 
the assistance of a freed slave now-servant.

161
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.280
Hmm. One of those things was not like the others.

162
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:44.080
Or Downton Abbey which has a VERY optimistic 
depiction of how upper-and lower-classes interact,  

163
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.600
and is host to any range of emotional support 
poors who are there to step in and offer some  

164
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.040
advice you can’t buy. In this media the 
problem with wealth is that the riches  

165
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.800
have forgotten to respect and value 
what services the poor can offer them.

166
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.040
Keep in mind, Willhelm’s infatuation with 
Simon begins while Simon is literally  

167
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.440
singing. The wealthy falling in love with 
the poor because of a song, or a poem,  

168
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.600
or even natural beauty, is something 
media has depicted across time.

169
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.440
On one hand, it is a message 
to the rich to value the poor  

170
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.280
because talent and merit is something that cannot 
be bought. On the other hand, it is a message to  

171
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.600
the poor to be as talented as humanly possible 
in the hopes of attracting a wealthy patron.

174
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.400
Media like this frames wealth as a gilded cage.  

175
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.280
And while poor people may 
not have financial stability,  

176
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.320
they are depicted as having a degree of freedom 
that is simply not accessible to the wealthy.

177
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.760
I’ve never been wealthy, so I 
can’t say if the former is true,  

178
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.560
but I can say that depicting poverty 
as ‘freedom’ is certainly… a take.  

179
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.240
You COULD say a non-royal poor person can kiss 
whoever they want without familial consequences  

180
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.840
or repercussions. But that is looking at 
poverty with very rose-tinted glasses.

181
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.800
In spite of the fact that it was a very 
well-crafted show with plenty of good  

182
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.600
characters and emotional realism, I did find 
Young Royals was a little guilty of this.  

183
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.720
If there was more content 
about Simon’s social standing,  

184
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.720
it didn’t make it into the final cut or it’s 
going to be explored in a second season.

185
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.400
Which is happening. Yay!

186
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.560
And of course, carrying on this discourse 
framed exclusively around Swedish wage classes,  

187
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.120
we’re getting into that nasty territory of saying  

188
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.880
“well it’s not as bad as it is 
in America, so stop complaining.”

189
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.480
And we’re not gonna do that here!

190
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.480
But it does re-enforce a toxic 
romanticization around poverty.  

191
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.040
This rich vs. poor depiction goes out 
of its way to make poor viewers grateful  

192
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.240
that they’re poor. They have something that the 
rich will never have, and they/we ought to be  

193
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.880
grateful for it. The REAL wealth is the people 
you meet along the way, and so on and so forth.

194
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.680
This media tells us that it’s the 
poors’ responsibility to keep the  

195
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.840
rich grounded and honest. But one 
thing this media does not highlight  

196
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.240
is that their responsibilities and 
reputations, are themselves, privileges.  

197
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.480
Even when there’s shame associated with 
not quite meeting those expectations.

198
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.840
But shame… is never something the poor can afford.

199
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.240
Shameless was a Showtime television series 
that ran for eleven seasons from 2011  

200
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.600
to 2021. It followed the story of the Gallaghers, 
a family living on the south side of Chicago who,  

201
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.640
depending on their current financial 
situation, could range from poor to destitute.

202
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.200
Though the main character for the first few season 
was inarguably, Fiona (despite what the Emmy  

203
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.320
Awards would have you believe) the main romantic 
draw of the show was not her on again off again  

204
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.880
relationships with multiple men, but the tense 
— sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking  

205
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.920
— relationship between her brother Ian, and his 
temperamental bossy bottom of a boyfriend, Mickey.

206
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.600
Ian and Mickey are established as enemies early 
on in the series but quickly turn into lovers,  

207
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.200
because who could resist Cameron 
Monaghan? Their relationship is,  

208
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.920
economically, one of equals. They both come from 
the same economically devastated neighbourhood,  

209
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.040
they both grew up with the same 
crappy parental situations,  

210
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.640
and they both have sisters who deserve 
so much more than life is giving them.

211
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.960
The real tension between Ian and Mickey, 
early on, is much like the tension between  

212
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.120
Willhelm and Simon. Mickey isn’t willing 
to come out of the closet to be with Ian.  

213
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.360
In fact, when Mickey’s outed he’s forced 
into a shotgun wedding to Svetlana,  

214
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.080
a bisexual Russian sex worker. In the end though,  

215
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.520
they end up in an oddly healthy (at least for 
them) relationship. Married and everything.

216
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.000
But their gayness isn’t really where the 
drama comes from. It would be untenable  

217
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.920
to try to drag out ‘Mickey doesn’t want to 
come out’ storylines for eleven seasons.  

218
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.040
The real drama comes from the economic situation.

219
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.080
Because of growing up in extreme poverty, Mickey 
has become a criminal like his father. Not being  

220
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.560
the least bit shy when it comes to brandishing 
firearms or breaking into people’s houses.  

221
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.240
He does time in jail multiple times throughout the 
series, but never comes out any different, really.

222
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.280
Because how could he? He’s been 
raised to be a certain way,  

223
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.320
and time in a state pen isn’t 
going to beat that out of him.

224
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.760
Ian, on the other hand, isn’t 
quite the criminal Mickey is.  

225
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.200
Nothing beyond the mischief most teenagers 
would get up to, for the most part.  

226
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.680
Ian just wants to get grades good enough 
to join the military. That’s his big dream.  

227
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.880
Which he does join, but does so illegally 
using his brother’s name and information.

228
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.240
When next we see Ian he’s gone AWOL 
from the military and has become a  

229
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.200
tweaked out GoGo boy at a gay bar. But 
luckily our unlikely prince charming,  

230
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.880
Mickey, swings in and rescues him. 
But Ian’s acting very strange,  

231
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.680
and this erratic behaviour increases while 
Mickey's problems with his wife also intensify.

232
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.640
Ian drifts in and out of manic episodes until his 
relationship with Mickey is fully confirmed, with  

233
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.160
Mickey outing himself at his son’s christening. 
The end of the manic episodes leaves Ian in bed,  

234
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.840
nearly unresponsive. It’s at this 
point that we discover that Ian,  

235
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.960
like his mother Monica, has Bipolar Disorder.

236
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.280
My mother also suffered from Bipolar 
Disorder so I know that with the right  

237
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.840
medication and coping mechanisms, this is 
a condition that can be mostly managed.  

238
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.760
But there’s a big difference 
between Ian and my mother.

239
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.600
Though I also grew up poor, we lived in Canada. 
So my mother was able to see the specialists she  

240
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.120
needed and get the medication she 
needed without us going homeless.

241
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.240
Ian, in Chicago, doesn’t have that luxury.

242
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.880
In fact when the diagnosis is first floated, 
Mickey refuses to allow Ian to be helped  

243
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.040
because it would, in all likelihood, result in 
him being institutionalised in a state mental  

244
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.200
health institution. Which, in case you haven’t 
heard, aren’t the nicest places. If Ian had the  

245
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.680
money to go see the doctors and get the meds 
he needed, it would be a different situation.

246
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.320
But everything deteriorates until Ian goes on 
a psychological bender, his erratic behaviour  

247
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.960
increasing to the point where he agrees to 
do unprotected porn, and abducts a baby.

248
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.240
Ending with him forced into a psych ward, 
where even Mickey agrees he needs treatment.

249
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.160
Though there are plenty more ups and downs 
for Ian and Mickey over the next few seasons,  

250
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.760
with both ending up in jail at one point, they 
do end up stabilised and happy in the end. But  

251
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.440
it takes eleven seasons, a lot of heartache, 
law breaking, violence, and trauma to get there.

252
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.040
But even when they do move out of the bad 
neighbourhood and into a nice building,  

253
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.000
they have no idea how to act in “proper 
society”. With the uppity middle class gays  

254
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.120
trying to be rich gays. They don’t quite fit 
in with the world above the poverty line.  

255
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.320
But neither do most of the 
people on the show, queer or not.

256
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.800
Fiona, Ian’s big sister and the family 
mother figure, hops from odd job to odd job,  

257
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.400
even cleaning out clogged sewage 
pipes to try and make ends meet.  

258
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.960
The spiral of just too many bad days eventually 
leads to her becoming an addict. Which,  

259
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.200
in turn, leads to the Gallagher family 
situation becoming even more precarious.

260
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.760
Once she gets clean, she works her way up to be 
the manager of a diner, which growing up poor  

261
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.040
seemed like a good solid job. But she soon finds 
out that being a manager isn’t all that different  

262
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.160
from working a cash register. You just have a 
lot more responsibilities and not a lot more pay.

263
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.200
That’s a situation I think a lot 
of people have been in. Growing up,  

264
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.520
I always thought that “manager” was the top of the 
tops. That's the job where you have two cars and  

265
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.040
a nice house. Where your kids have a college 
fund, etc.. Because what’s above the manager?

266
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.840
But then I actually started working, got myself 
into a managerial marketing position and realised…

267
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.480
Oh… Managers are just employees 
who are expected to be the bad guy.  

268
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.600
The people with real power, 
real money, are the owners.  

269
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.400
They’re the ones with the nice houses 
and the cars and the college funds.

270
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.560
They don’t really teach you 
that in high school though.  

271
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.520
That no matter how hard you work for a company, 
no matter how high you climb in that company,  

272
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.680
you’ll always be under somebody else. 
Not so different from Young Royals where  

273
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.560
no matter what Simon does, no matter what 
his family does, they will always, always,  

274
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.040
be below Wilhelm. Because they cannot 
work their way into the aristocracy.

275
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.520
America doesn’t have royals, but they do have 
millionaires and billionaires. You can work  

276
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.080
your way into the manager position of a company, 
but it's near impossible to work your way into  

277
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.280
the CEO position. That glass ceiling is there, 
it’s just blocking something other than a crown.

278
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.040
CEO’s are the royalty of America, basically.

279
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.040
And like the royals of other 
countries, they are fabulously wealthy  

280
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.080
and yet still take state funding through tax 
cuts, tax rebates, and government contracts.  

281
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.160
At least the Royals of Europe are honest 
about it. They just take the money,  

282
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.240
they don’t create five layers of separation 
so that people think they’re ‘creating jobs.’

283
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.280
I think that might be why Americans romanticise 
the royals of Europe so much. They’re not trying  

284
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.680
to convince people that they aren’t as rich as 
they are. Most of them aren’t pretending that  

285
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.960
they’re just like everyone else, a sad performance 
Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates try to pull off.

286
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.760
REAL royals live in gilded palaces, not 
open concept ranch-style homes that just  

287
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.720
happen to have a tennis court, two 
pools, a personal movie theatre,  

288
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.120
and an underground garage with multiple Italian 
cars they barely know how to pump gas into.

289
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.840
That might even be why people were attracted to  

290
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.080
Donald Trump while he ran for president. He was 
rich and made no show of pretending he wasn’t.  

291
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.600
Hillary Clinton was filthy rich too, maybe 
even richer than Donald Trump if some of his  

292
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.600
tax returns are accurate, but she pretended to be 
a common person. Just a good ol’ Arkansas girl.

293
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.280
While Trump, though the epitome of everything 
that had ruined their lives, didn’t really put on  

294
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.840
airs. He bragged about a gold toilet, but people 
liked him because he was “telling it like it is.”

295
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.160
And racist, they liked him because he was racist.

296
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.760
But a lot of people were just willing 
to look past the racism because he  

297
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.720
was a rich who wasn’t putting on a 
facade. He wasn’t driving an SUV,  

298
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.600
he was driven around in town cars and limos 
and private jets. That romanticization of  

299
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.840
abundant apparent wealth helped him the 
same way it helps the royals of Europe.

300
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.120
It also helps, in my opinion,  

301
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.040
that many European countries have strong 
social safety nets that America lacks.  

302
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.160
Take for instance the depiction of what passes for 
impoverished between Shameless and Young Royals.

303
00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.360
Simon’s family isn’t rich by any means, but they 
do have a house and their mom does have a car.  

304
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.960
And whatever job she has, it's enough to keep that 
house paid for, keep that car paid for, and give  

305
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.760
her enough time in the day to make homemade dinner 
for her kids, and their friends a lot of the time.

306
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.480
And as far as Simon’s classmates are concerned, 
that basically makes him dirt poor. He’s not,  

307
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.640
by any means, but… that’s how he’s seen. Looked 
down upon because he doesn’t live on campus.

308
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.400
Meanwhile on Shameless poor is, well, poor. Where 
it’s sometimes seven to nine people living in a  

309
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.800
house with three bedrooms, one of which seems more 
like a storage room. And everyone in the family,  

310
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.760
even the kids, need to pool their money 
to make sure they can keep the bills paid.

311
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.800
One month on, one month off. This month we pay 
the power pill, next month we pay the phone bill.  

312
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.360
Get what we can from the food bank, and make 
that baby formula last as long as possible.

313
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.880
One mistake. ONE financial venture gone awry, 
could send the whole house of cards tumbling  

314
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.920
down. What if Debbie can't get any babysitting 
jobs? What if Lip cant get any tutoring jobs?  

315
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.960
What if Ian lost his job at the corner store? What 
if their mostly-absentee alcoholic father Frank  

316
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.280
finds the coffee can with the monthly funds 
stashed in it and decides to go on a bender?

317
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.440
Destitution. One mistake. One oopsie daisy  

318
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.640
and the lives of the whole 
family could come crashing down.

319
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.040
While on Young Royals, when Simon demands 
August pay him the money he’s owed,  

320
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.240
getting even slightly aggressive, his friends 
look at him like he’s turned into a monster.

321
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.520
Implying that spending time around 
rich people is causing Simon to  

322
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.280
absorb money-first values by osmosis. Who’s 
there to support the emotional support poor,  

323
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.240
when he starts to lose his passive, 
resolve-conflict-with-mediation values?

324
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.840
Meanwhile on Shameless  

325
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.360
you don’t go demanding money back 
without a crew and at least an iron pipe.

326
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.000
So the two shows are very different, with very 
different depictions of being gay. But one  

327
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
thing they DO have in common is that they’re 
both, in their most basic forms, tragedies.  

328
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.120
Shameless is a tragedy about the poor thinking 
they can climb their way out of poverty,  

329
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.840
and Young Royals is a tragedy about the rich.

330
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.720
Simon, though he may be the 
audience’s cypher character,  

331
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.680
is not the tragic figure. Wilhelm 
is. Felice is. And, to an extent,  

332
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.240
August is. Wilhelm can’t be himself. Feliece 
is held to impossible standards by her family.  

333
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.840
And August falls from grace when his family can’t 
afford to pay his tuition any longer. August still  

334
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.440
has the assets that he could liquidate, but 
his pigheaded “legacy” thinking won’t let him.

335
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.040
So which is more tragic? The poor being trapped 
in a forever-cycle of poverty? Or the rich being  

336
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.840
inconvenienced? Well that’s a debate for the ages.

337
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.960
They say a comedy is a play 
with a wedding in the final act,  

338
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.520
and a tragedy is a play with 
a wedding in the second act.

339
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.960
And that’s probably a better rule for tragedy 
than whatever Hegel or Aristotle cooked up. Ah,  

340
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.720
pathos this, ethos that! Sure, fine. Go on Mary. 
Invent a system of logic specifically to justify  

341
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.120
why you and your rich friends can’t be bothered 
to empathise with plays about poor people.

342
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.640
And no, as much as it may make 
for a great cure for insomnia,  

343
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.960
we’re not going to summarise Poetics beat by 
beat here. And we’re also not going to talk about  

344
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.720
Hegel’s thoughts on Tragedy because, though it may 
be described as contrasting Aristotle’s theories,  

345
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.120
“Contrasting ideas” in philosophy basically 
amounts to using the word ‘necessarily’  

346
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.480
versus ‘necessarily’ written in italic font.

347
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.840
As far as the language of philosophy is 
concerned — it’s a completely different word.

348
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.680
Suffice To say, and this has been 
true for the bulk of human history,  

349
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.800
the primary focus of tragedy and drama 
is upon the struggles of being rich. In  

350
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.840
one way or another. This could 
be for any number of reasons.

351
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.160
Most likely — the people sponsoring and 
attending theatre were people with money.  

352
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.240
And they would absolutely like to see 
themselves reflected in these characters.

353
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.400
But in Aristotle’s Poetics, he claims 
that a necessary component of tragedy is  

354
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.800
that the tragic hero must fall from grace. 
The thought process here is that if you’re  

355
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.440
already at the bottom — there’s nowhere 
else to fall. So can it really be tragic?

356
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.960
Tragedy, to Aristotle, had the role 
of shaping society through a means  

357
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.640
of — and I’m paraphrasing, 
here — cautionary parables.

358
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.120
For instance, maybe the world would be a 
better place, Mr. Oedipus, if you didn’t  

359
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.960
go around the Balkan peninsula and murder 
everyone who had road rage as bad as you do.

360
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.320
Things like that.

361
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.840
As most of the ancient world existed 
in an openly classist system, it was  

362
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.440
more or less seen as the natural order 
of things for the poor to be suffering.  

363
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.880
And well… things can’t really get any more tragic 
if you start out suffering. Or so they thought.

364
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.880
You did have theatrical productions which 
would have been called Domestic Tragedies,  

365
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.120
focusing on the middle or working classes. But  

366
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.480
even these were scoffed at for not having 
the gravitas of assassinating a demi-god.

367
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.840
Meanwhile, what’s really going 
on is that philosophers were  

368
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.840
just salty because the only thing 
they were ‘lords’ of was the edge.

369
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.640
It’s not that the wealthy patrons 
of theatre didn’t want to know that  

370
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.720
poor peoples’ lives were hard. They knew 
exactly how they treated their employees.

371
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.840
AND SOMETIMES IN HISTORY CALLING THEM 
‘EMPLOYEES’ WOULD BE A VERY, VERY GENEROUS WORD.

372
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.480
It was more that they just didn’t care. 
In the wealthy’s own inflated view of  

373
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.040
their self-importance, what’s a little 
emotional abuse to a couple servants?

374
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.880
Look at me!
Look at me! 

375
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.440
How dare you?
Close your eyes!

376
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.480
As for why the wealthy favoured 
tragedies over feel-good stories?  

377
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.640
Scholars have written at length 
about why tragedy is more important,  

378
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.320
but it seems like a lot of the arguments 
boil down to ‘because I said so,’  

379
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.120
or ‘because this old reclusive intellectual 
who was alive hundreds of years ago said so.’

380
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.440
This is exclusively a personal observation, 
but I find that intellectual-types  

381
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.720
tend to glorify dourness. Like they feel like 
something is more significant if its depressing.  

382
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.000
As if a pessimistic depiction of the 
world is automatically more authentic.

383
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.880
I think in many ways, we consider optimism to 
be manipulative. That it’s trying to convince  

384
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.520
you that the world is inherently good, and 
light-hearted. And that we lean towards the belief  

385
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:05.120
that real human nature is rooted in darkness. 
Or that optimism is a cover-up for sadness.

386
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.120
So comedy and light-hearted media is 
often viewed, now and in the past,  

387
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.000
as being frivolous and unimportant. And therefore, 
lacking the gravitas that scholars consider  

388
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.160
‘authentic’ enough to be important. For evidence 
o this, look at the Oscar nominations every year.

389
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.320
Yet comedy is much broader as a theory 
than just fart jokes and slapstick.

390
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.360
For example, we wouldn’t necessarily describe 
Charles Dickens as ‘comedic.’ HOWEVER,  

391
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.560
he did craft his stories around the working class, 
and often depicted a lifting of their fortunes.  

392
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.240
As with his classics: A Christmas Carol, 
Great Expectations, and Hard Times.

393
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.080
Dickens was a fan of ‘bittersweet’ 
endings, and these stories, at least,  

394
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.240
involve the poors being lifted from destitution 
and the wealthy having learned a lesson at the  

395
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.280
expense of their social standing. It’s comedic 
in the sense that it opposes tragedy. Whether  

396
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.400
this qualifies these stories as capitol-C ‘Comedy’ 
would probably vary from one scholar to the next.

397
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.440
Though still, it can be said that Dickens was an 
author who wanted to use his platform to outline  

398
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.880
that poverty itself is a tragedy. Certainly 
not the only one — coming to mind is La Boheme,  

399
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.840
in which the starving artists burn 
their art to keep warm in the winter.

400
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.600
You could even say that Les Miserables 
or the Phantom of the Opera (the novel,  

401
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.960
not the Andrew Loydd Webber glorified 
theme park attraction) fit the bill,  

402
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.760
because they contain a commentary on class 
dynamics. Even though the central focus  

403
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.560
IS on characters of high social standing 
or who reach high social standing.

404
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.080
However, it wasn’t until much later that we 
began a critical discourse around poverty  

405
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.960
and tragedy in earnest. This was in 1949, with 
the Broadway premiere of Death of a Salesman.  

406
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.240
And though almost all of us have had to 
read it for high school English class,  

407
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.040
reception was actually 
rather mixed upon its debut.

408
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.400
Some critics felt that it was nothing 
more than a promotion of playwright  

409
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.880
Aurther Miller’s Marxist leanings. I mean, 
apparently giving a rat’s ass about people the  

410
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.280
government is stepping on makes you a Marxist. 
According to… everyone in American news media.

411
00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.320
And maybe it was because of heated ideological 
debates and literal wars over political economics  

412
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.960
in the first half of the century that this 
play really sparked that debate. However,  

413
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.360
unlike other tragedies about middle 
class and lower class heroes, to whom  

414
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:15.040
tragic events happened, Death of a Salesman’s 
narrative treats poverty itself as the tragedy.

415
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.960
American poverty, specifically, as it exists 
in a culture of greed, envy, and desperation.

416
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.440
Tragedy did, however, lose its popularity. 
As theatre became more and more populace,  

417
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.960
and especially as movies came to dominate popular 
entertainment. Audiences who hadn’t read Aristotle  

418
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.240
really weren’t that interested in sad endings. Or 
at least the definition of a tragedy has broadened  

419
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.000
to the point where you don’t need a bunch 
of rich people causing problems on purpose.

420
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.160
Many of the same principles of Tragedy 
are simply what is found in the genre of  

421
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.760
‘Drama’ as a whole. In fact, tragic 
events are usually used to advance  

422
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.800
the plot and generate friction 
for the characters in most media.

423
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.640
And it’s in this very roundabout 
way that, for the sake of argument,  

424
00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.080
I’m perfectly willing to qualify both 
Shameless and Young Royals as tragedies.

425
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.320
If Aristotle can use ‘logic’ to 
make exceptions for things he likes,  

426
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.440
and find ways to justify them 
academically, then so can I!

427
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.800
“Oh, well James, you can’t do that! Aristotle 
was one of the greatest minds in human history.”

428
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.800
Yeah, only because his friends said so!

429
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.080
You know what Aristotle didn’t know?  

430
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.520
That the mitochondria is the ‘power 
plant of the cell.’ See? Smarts.

431
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.960
The difficulty with analysing modern media 
on the basis of comedy vs. tragedy is that  

432
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.320
almost universally, authors (and creators of all 
types of media) like to incorporate elements of  

433
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.040
both for a single work. You usually get a bit 
of dramatic tension in comedies, and you’re  

434
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.200
likely to get someone cracking a joke or two 
so that characters seem more human in a drama.

435
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.640
Tried and true ‘the hero dies’ 
tragedies are very uncommon today  

436
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.640
because audiences generally don’t like investing 
in media to have their hearts ripped out.

437
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.840
But we can look at this media, and 
gauge the overall feelings that this  

438
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.880
media is trying to project. In 
either case, we, the audience,  

439
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.440
are meant to see the themes of suffering and 
hardship that these characters are undergoing.

440
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:09.600
Shameless absolutely fits a more Miller-esque 
tragic sense. And though tragic it may be,  

441
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.840
there are moments where struggles 
and obstacles are played for laughs.

442
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.240
This is because it is not the individual 
instances of characters failing  

443
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.720
that we are meant to see as tragic, 
but rather their overall circumstances.  

444
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.720
The fact that, though we root for them, 
we know they’re doomed to fail because  

445
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.920
American wealth is an institution that does 
not easily permit those to rise above poverty.

446
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.920
What these characters go through is what many 
other American families experience. Even as the  

447
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.360
narrative devices in the show make us laugh, we 
realise that these are situations that real people  

448
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.560
undergo every day. And that if the show treated 
every tragedy as sorely as it is in real life,  

449
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.520
that would feed into the sense of 
inescapability that many people exist in.

450
00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.200
As the great Carrie Fisher once said: “If my 
life wasn’t funny, it would just be true.”

451
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.600
And there is something to be said about 
appreciating the absurdity of a situation  

452
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.640
you are in, even while what little you have 
built of your life is collapsing around you.  

453
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.560
People who exist in poverty are no less 
capable of literary analysis than people  

454
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.640
of means. Spotting situations where 
reality is stranger than fiction may  

455
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.480
very well be what keeps a lot of us from 
crossing over the point of no return.

456
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.680
However, compare and contrast to 
Young Royals, where the tragedy is  

457
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.400
rooted in emotional unfulfillment. After 
undergoing a degree of emotional growth,  

458
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.480
Willhelm decides he’s gonna put his 
heart on the line and gets a big old—

459
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.120
Katya: “Party.”

460
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.200
—from his love-interest. Sure it’s not Hamlet, 
but for a show that is built around the  

461
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.880
soon-to-be-crown-prince’s emotional development, 
this is definitely not a happy ending.

462
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.520
And while that may have been the finale, also 
keep in mind that Willhelm’s older brother died,  

463
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.480
his mother cared more about optics than his 
emotional state during a sex-tape scandal,  

464
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.600
and that his family in general consistently 
betrays and micormanages him. We are given  

465
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.880
a very strong feeling that his life is hard.

466
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.840
In fact, when it comes to his 
status, wealth, and titles,  

467
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.920
he has to be reminded by his mother that 
this is not a burden, it is a privilege.

468
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.080
And this is where an analysis of 
Young Royals really gets interesting.  

469
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.640
Because Young Royals can fit very nicely 
into that Aristotelian sense of tragedy.  

470
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.520
As the peak of dramatic tension is built 
around Simon’s lukewarm rejection of Willhelm,  

471
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.040
we can see that, throughout the plot, Willhelm has 
played an abundant role in earning that tragedy.

472
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.320
Go back to grade 9 English where we 
talk about a tragic hero’s ‘turning  

473
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.360
point’ — but where your English teacher 
never explained why that was significant.  

474
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.480
In theatrical tragedy, the hero must 
do something that makes the tragedy  

475
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.920
inevitable. They have to actively make a decision 
that leads to bad stuff happening to them.

476
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.480
This is absent from Miller’s sense of tragedy,  

477
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.000
as in that case, the tragic elements 
will occur regardless of the hero’s  

478
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.080
actions — which itself is the real tragedy: 
a lack of control over one's circumstances.

479
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.240
The real tragedy in Willhelm’s life is 
one that he does not have control over:  

480
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.640
the death of his brother. Everything else: 
ranging from education to boy problems are  

481
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.920
caused by his behaviour or lack of behaviour. 
In the case of Simon, this is abundantly clear.

482
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.480
He spent the whole season jerking this boy 
around, which Simon was very forgiving of because…  

483
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.600
you’re a gay teenager in a place where you 
feel you don’t belong. You are naturally  

484
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.080
going to forgive a lot of crappy behaviour 
because someone’s paying attention to you.

485
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960
A nice touch of realism that I really appreciated.

486
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.200
But the bridge too far for Simon was Willhelm’s 
public denouncement of their relationship.  

487
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.200
Wilhelm was not allowed to be romantically 
or sexually involved with another man.  

488
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.400
And so instead of standing up 
for himself against his family,  

489
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.480
Willhelm baulked, and agreed 
to keep the love affair secret.

490
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:55.360
And from Simon’s perspective: it’s hard for 
something to feel like ‘love’ if the other person  

491
00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.240
keeps you hidden. And I will reiterate a point 
from previous videos that ‘forbidden love’ is not  

492
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.880
nearly as glamorous as romance authors will 
have you think. That kinda stuff gets real  

493
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.600
toxic real fast, and leads to very 
nasty psychological developments.

494
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.640
There’s a reason why queer folk have 
been fighting for an end to closets.

495
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:20.400
Willhelm’s turning point, as it were, was choosing 
the crown’s responsibilities over Simon. And while  

496
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.040
yes, you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket 
as a teenager, it’s a bit of a kick in the balls  

497
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.640
when someone else thinks that they’re going to 
have the best of both worlds at your expense.

498
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.200
Simon, as it happens, is openly gay. He 
doesn’t seem the slightest bit ashamed by it,  

499
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.080
nor is it something that he feels 
he ought to hide from anyone.  

500
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:43.440
I can’t imagine he would be comfortable being 
in the closet because his boyfriend has to be.

501
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.240
But as this show is framed from Willhelm’s 
perspective, and follows Willhelm’s development,  

502
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.520
what is that meant to signify? If Willhelm’s 
parents are aware that he’s gay (or bi), it  

503
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.880
does not seem as if that’s a discussion anyone’s 
willing to have. His mother seems ambivalent in  

504
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.040
the worst way… where she doesn’t really care 
except when it creates a hassle for the Crown.

505
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.480
And then Willhelm is simply 
a problem that needs fixing.

506
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.040
And doesn’t that just suck 
for Willhelm? Seriously.

507
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.120
His boyfriend can be openly gay, and he seems 
to have a greater grasp on his mental health  

508
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.480
in spite of aluded childhood trauma. Simon has 
more freedom over who he can be friends with,  

509
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.160
more personal autonomy, and he 
has a say when it comes to family  

510
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:30.880
decisions. His mother can also stomach to 
look him in the eye, let alone hug him.

511
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.280
Tallying up the score… Kinda makes you 
prefer the idea of being poor. Right?

512
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.000
Like, according to Young Royals, being poor is 
kinda great. Much better than being rich where  

513
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.320
everyone is trying to exploit you. Because, ah, 
poor Willhelm. Caught in the dregs of being young,  

514
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.040
wealthy, and fabulously well-to-do. 
With his titles and holdings.

515
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.120
He’s so oppressed.

516
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.480
Which is exactly what his emotional support poor 
is here to help him through. Saying NO to the man.

517
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.920
And it’s not that I’m particularly holding 
this against Young Royals. Like I said,  

518
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.440
it’s not alone in the use of an 
emotional support poor to help a  

519
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.080
rich person screw their head on straight. 
And it doesn’t even need to be romantic.  

520
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.120
Look at the great personal service 
Timon and Pumba offered Simba.

521
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.600
This is a recurring theme in media where 
the wealthy and royal require good ol’  

522
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.200
poverty values to sort out all of their toxic 
behaviour and be more complete human beings. To  

523
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.680
reinvigorate their cold, money-obsessed 
lives with wholesome personal growth.  

524
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.840
Because it’s the wealthy’s feelings we 
should care about in this situation.

525
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.640
Sound of Music. My Fair Lady. Gone With the Wind. 
Jasmine and Aladdin. Achilles and Patroclus,  

526
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.880
if you wanna get gay about it. It’s one of 
those fiction rules where when you SEE it,  

527
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.680
you can’t stop seeing it.

528
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.640
It gets really bad when you begin to dig into 
mythology, where our history of literature really  

529
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.920
likes to remind poor people that wealth 
leads to a hollow, empty life and that  

530
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.880
they should pity the rich. And do as little as 
possible to try and become wealthy themselves,  

531
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.760
or to revolt against the sad rich people 
because their lives are hard enough as it is.

532
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.760
But poverty? That’s where 
the real human values are.

533
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.800
It’s even in the bible.

534
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.800
Thank god we have Journey Into the West,  

535
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.400
where we have a buddhist monk wandering around 
China with his polycule of disgraced furries.

536
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.360
But everyone else is a rich person in need of 
the underclass to help them sort out their crap.

537
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.400
Look at Shakespeare!

538
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.600
Scholars have remarked that the separation 
between some of Shakespere’s comedies and  

539
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.560
his tragedies are divided by the presence of 
the quote: ‘wise fool.’ A comedic character  

540
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.520
who is able to peer through social pretence and 
posturing, to see the real mechanics of what’s  

541
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.320
going on. He would steer the characters to the 
place they need to be to resolve their conflicts.

542
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.800
In plays where there is no ‘wise fool,’ characters  

543
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.600
continue to spiral out of control 
and eventually kill each other.

544
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.320
I guess you get to a point of wealth and 
importance where basic human emotional  

545
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.120
functions just altogether stop. And 
you require the services of someone  

546
00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:01.360
who needs to spend most of their life fighting 
to even eat to remind you what really matters.

547
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.960
Like learning how to spit.

548
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.520
In any case, rich-framed media about the 
interactions of the wealthy and the poor  

549
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.360
result in a utilitarian study of what 
services the poor can offer the rich.  

550
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.240
Sometimes even in a literal 
context like The King and I,  

551
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.800
or Sound of Music. The people who benefit 
from this arrangement are always the wealthy.

552
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.240
Keep in mind that Willhelm first falls in  

553
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.600
love with Simon — at first sight — when 
Simon is offering a service. His voice.

554
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.960
How the poors directly 
benefit from this is unclear,  

555
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.920
and not always consistent. First, the poor has 
to be the one resisting the relationship… for  

556
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.920
reasons? And there’s no real pattern about 
whether the poor is elevated to live lavishly,  

557
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.200
or if the rich sacrifices their 
wealth because ‘all you need is love.’

558
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.040
The direction of the plot is 
rooted in how the poor belong  

559
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.440
with the rich. (Or to the rich.) And there 
isn’t usually enough time to describe why  

560
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.600
these people belong together. Because if the 
poor person doesn’t have their crap together,  

561
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.720
and if they’re poor — then they simply don’t 
have anything to offer. The arrangement goes:  

562
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.840
the rich offer financial stability — 
the poor offer emotional stability.

563
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.400
And there IS something obnoxious about telling  

564
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.760
people who can’t afford to pay their 
bills that all they need is love.

565
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.320
For while we enter a discussion about how the 
rich are so stuffy in their responsibilities  

566
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.480
and reputations, and how the poors’ role is 
to liberate them from those confinements,  

567
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.480
we over-inflate the freedom 
of poverty, and omit the ways  

568
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.640
that a lack of wealth fundamentally 
stifles individual freedoms.

569
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.280
The poor, in general, have to dedicate a 
lot of their time and energy to not being  

570
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.080
destitute. Resulting from that, are a myriad 
of physical and psychological health-problems.  

571
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:49.760
Which, either due to working too much to recover 
or not being able to see a specialist at all,  

572
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.280
means that these issues may not 
get resolved in a meaningful way.  

573
00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:00.080
It’s unfair to expect the poor to liberate the 
rich when the poor cannot liberate themselves.

574
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.960
Being ‘poor’ isn’t ‘free.’ 
Being poor is expensive.

575
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.960
And being poor does not afford the freedom that 
wealth-obsessed fiction indicates that it does.

576
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.160
Rent.

577
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.360
While many, if not most authors did not begin 
wealthy, many of the tropes that exist in modern  

578
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.560
fiction were developed in a time when in order 
to be an author, you needed to be educated.  

579
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.680
Which, before education was socialised, was 
something you could only get if you were wealthy…

580
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.840
Or if like Dickens’ Pip, you had 
a mysteriously wealthy benefactor.

581
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.200
But because these authors were so 
disillusioned with their own lives,  

582
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.400
they snap-reacted to a 
‘grass is greener’ argument.  

583
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.320
To the point where you had such and such 
Victorian poet musing about how a rambling,  

584
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.800
untreated mentally ill homeless man was living 
the authentic life, compared to their gilded cage.

585
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.520
Which leads us to media like Shameless. Which 
instead of creating a retelling about how  

586
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.400
great it is to be poor, actually goes through — 
beat by beat — to create a discourse about what  

587
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:02.480
it’s actually like to be poor. And what people 
mean by ‘privileged’ when talking about wealth.

588
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.240
Come to think of it, why do we obsess so much over 
wealthy people in media as a general rule? We love  

589
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:14.160
rich people being naughty! Dallas, from the 1980s. 
Real Housewives and reality television in general.

590
00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.320
Even as much as Game of Thrones liked to play 
the field when it came to riches and poors, the  

591
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.920
second George R.R. Martin was off payroll of 
that show, tit shifted to being a glorification  

592
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.200
of all the ways that Rich people get to 
have choices and poor people die in wars.

593
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.440
…Sam and Gillie. Emotional support poors.

594
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.200
…oh god. Sam and Frodo. 
Emotional support poor hobbits.

595
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.480
DOES IT EVER END?

596
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.040
I’m curious to see what everyone 
thinks about this. Leave some of  

597
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.680
your favourite emotional support 
poors in the comments below.

598
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.040
One could say that our 
obsession with wealth in media,  

599
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.920
and specifically how the riches 
are problematically flawed,  

600
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.720
comes from a kind of sadistic joy that 
these people are more messed up than we are.

601
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.320
“Alexis Carrington-Colby 
pushed someone into a pool?  

602
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.160
I would never do that! WHY 
IS SHE RICH BUT I’M NOT?”

603
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:05.600
The media reaffirms that our lack of wealth 
affords us a sense of dignity and perspective.  

604
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.800
We have perspective enough not 
to push someone into a pool  

605
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.680
or throw a drink at someone 
over a perceived slight.

606
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.720
Knowing full well… that this is not the case.

607
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.880
I speak from experience, you’re probably just as 
likely to have poor people acting like that too.  

608
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.480
It’s not like all the poors are down at 
the bottom trying to cooperate. In fact,  

609
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:30.880
especially in areas of scarcity, some poors like 
feeling like they’re at the top of a heap. So  

610
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.440
they can be a little bit touchy when it comes 
to what respect they feel like they’re owed.

611
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.400
A lot of poor people live under the expectation 
established by propaganda — that hard work begets  

612
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.640
success. And some preemptively model themselves 
based on what they believe ‘rich values’ to be.  

613
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.480
And place a heightened sense of importance on 
reputation and social standing. Specifically  

614
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.040
in the event that they may be rich one day, it 
would be good to have that sorted out in advance.

615
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.680
I want to specify that I see 
this as a problem with society,  

616
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.320
and not a problem with any 
singular piece of media.

617
00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.800
I liked Young Royals. Let’s be clear!

618
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.320
When you’re setting out to make a simple 
teenage love story that takes place in a  

619
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.720
fancy boarding school, it’s not fair to expect 
every piece of media to reinvent the wheel.

620
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.920
So naturally, you are going to lean on some 
tropes that have persisted — apparently — since  

621
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.720
the dawn of time. Thus, even if you are 
making an anti-classist piece of media,  

622
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.440
you are leaning on tropes which 
are, in turn, rooted in classism.

623
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.680
These tropes treat the poor, even in 
media depictions where the rich appear to  

624
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.880
value poor people, as a class of people who 
exist to provide a service to the wealthy.  

625
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:41.840
And this media in turn, may highlight problems 
within wealth, though inevitably depicts the  

626
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.160
‘right kind’ of wealth triumphing over the 
wrong kind. That there are good riches and bad  

627
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:53.600
riches — and what we have to do is make sure that 
the ‘good’ or ‘rightful’ Royals succeed in ruling.

628
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.560
The same is true for American media where there 
are ‘good’ capitalists. And the poors’ only role  

629
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.600
is to actively support and assist the good ones 
in defeating the bad ones. And even if the good  

630
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.560
ones fail, they still have their trust fund and 
now they have a romance with a once-poor person.

631
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.400
This trope is, of course, a fantasy. 
Bagging a rich person who’s going to  

632
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.520
take care of you financially, while 
you take care of them emotionally,  

633
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.360
is more or less like winning the lottery.

634
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.600
But the part that frustrates me is that 
even while I’m condemning the use of  

635
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.800
emotional support poors in media… don’t 
you kinda wish it could happen to you?

636
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.680
To get whisked away from our mundane life 
and find ourselves swept into the fast  

637
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:39.280
lane of glamour and opulence? Especially when 
there’s a gorgeous royal (literal or figurative)  

638
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.200
to hold our hand through it?

639
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:51.840
But there’s a problem we’re not addressing here.

640
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.880
When it comes to media, in order to analyse it, 
we have to ask the tough questions. What is the  

641
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.840
author trying to convey about the state of the 
world? What is the author saying needs to change?

642
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.960
And quite frankly, I’m 
surprised it took Young Royals  

643
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.480
for me to realise this. Because looking 
back, the writing is on the wall.

644
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.840
Wake up people.

645
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.920
The messaging is obvious. They’ve been 
screaming out for thousands of years and  

646
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:33.840
we’ve been too pig-headed to listen. The REAL 
victims of wealth inequality… are the rich.

647
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.280
There is a literal never-ending flow of 
media-material talking about how miserable the  

648
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:48.240
rich are specifically because they’re rich. 
It doesn’t end. They’ve been begging poor  

649
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:54.640
people to save them for so long and now they’re 
beginning to realise lifting up one or two poor  

650
00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:02.240
people from obscurity to reinvigorate the rich 
community’s sense of perspective is not enough.

651
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.760
This can’t be a one-or-two person effort. Charlie 
Buckett here, Oliver Twist there. But here we are,  

652
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.360
with Rich people still going on about how awful 
it is to be wealthy and powerful and important,  

653
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.880
and living without a single 
care in the world except  

654
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:23.040
for the hollow and empty lives they lead 
from the burden of having so much money.

655
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.840
They’re actively asking us to 
take their money... All of us.

656
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.800
And it’s going to take all of us. A 
real group effort. A communal effort.  

657
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.840
We’re the problem. Don’t you see? 
I see that now — it’s all so clear!

658
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.560
It’s our obligation to roll up our sleeves 
and redistribute wealth ourselves. We have the  

659
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.080
emotional intelligence, the determination, and the 
kind of moxie you can only get from being poor.  

660
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.200
The rich are far too stifled 
to come out of their shells,  

661
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.440
so it’s up to us to pry open those 
clams and take their pearls from them.

662
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.440
Pearls are, after all, a 
deposit of sand and grain.  

663
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:17.040
It’s just a collection of mundane things. Really, 
clams are better off without them. Just like the  

664
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.520
rich obviously see themselves as people who just 
happened to collect a bunch of mundane things  

665
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.880
and now have this uncomfortable LUMP of money 
that does nothing but create problems for them.

666
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.640
They’re obviously suffering. And they’ve 
been trying to tell us. It’s time for us  

667
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.760
to buck up and be as empathetic as they say we 
are and do them a favour by taking their money.

668
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.080
Don’t you know… the emptier your bank account… 
the fuller your heart. And quite frankly,  

669
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.840
we’ve been hoarding a fortune of heart.

670
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.400
And so when it comes to us — those 
with less than three months savings  

671
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.680
in our bank account — it’s time to open 
our hearts… and redistribute the love.

672
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.840
Together… we can make it so 
no figurative or literal Royal  

673
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.400
ever has to suffer neck problems under 
the weight of a heavy crown ever again.

674
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:35.840
Save a rich person’s life. 
Redistribute their wealth. Today.
