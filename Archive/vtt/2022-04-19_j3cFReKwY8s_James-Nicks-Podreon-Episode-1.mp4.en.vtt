um
topics and stuff like that and we'll be

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.640
just for patrons just for you guys
because there's thousands of you now

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.600
so we need exclusive content
yeah we want stuff to be able to go out

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.040
to just patrons yeah um so this is
and the podcast has been something that

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.160
you know hasn't been super heavily
demanded but there have been some

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.800
loyalists who have been holding out yeah
uh while we do our weird hiatuses uh we

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.760
definitely do this is definitely it
would be the third season

13
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.800
of the podcast
i mean if you count the ones we did

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.320
years ago we don't
yeah but if you did i mean this would be

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.360
like season eight yeah um um we just
fell out of touch uh with everyone uh

16
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.720
last year for you know if you've been
following james like you probably know

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.119
why yeah everything with my mom uh so i
think we put out an episode or two in

18
00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.960
january and that was that was about it i
think we recorded one before my mom

19
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.360
right before my mom passed
um but let's not get on up yeah off on a

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.240
sad note been busy beavers busy bees
uh very busy very distractible so we

21
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.840
haven't had a whole lot of time to sit
down and do the podcast i think we sort

22
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.880
of looked at each other and we're like
yeah

23
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.759
in april we'll start doing them again
and we're on that trajectory so

24
00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.240
i don't even remember saying april but
sure yeah it's like when these next few

25
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.159
videos slow down because we've been
putting videos out of crazy keolis last

26
00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.399
few months yeah for the over the last
two months we put out five videos that's

27
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.399
insane not including my my patron
yeah video

28
00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.920
um my explaining youtube's dickery video
but it's been five videos in two months

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
so
that is

30
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.880
a lot when you're used to putting out
one video

31
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.360
and none of them have been like
a 10 minute video or anything like that

32
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
even the short one ended up being 20
minutes yeah that was the

33
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.879
science of the sounds of the mouse
no no i mean that one was even a half

34
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.959
hour but the short one was the um

35
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.239
dumbledore
dumbledore grindeldore grindledore the

36
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.680
short one was grindeldore
and uh

37
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680
that one is doing incredibly well i'm
really happy that is because like we

38
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.280
were both kind of like it's a new format
like a new kind of video format so we

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.400
were really nervous to see how it was
going to play out yeah and it was also

40
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.599
the first video to come out after the
big patron surge

41
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.160
and
i didn't real like the video is 20

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.200
minutes long but the video is 28 minutes
long because it's an eight-minute patron

43
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.879
scroll and there are so many comments of
people just being like i can't believe

44
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.239
the last third of this video is all
patrons yeah so i have um i bought a new

45
00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.200
plug-in for final cut that will let me
do like three rows three rows nice

46
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.120
patrons okay it's not a you know eight
or nine minute scroll at the end of the

47
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.440
video
um it'll just be like a two-minute

48
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.920
scroll
which

49
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.800
which is still super long because
there's been probably another 200

50
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.440
patrons have come on since that video
went out it's been crazy just like the

51
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.000
thought process going behind exactly
like the shift from like we need to

52
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.920
basically are we allowed to do swears on
this oh yeah this is only for we're

53
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.560
allowed to we need to suck youtube's
dick uh basically and go from you know

54
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.840
sucking our patrons decks um
which i would much prefer to not be

55
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.840
sucking off the dicks of corporatist
swine if i suck it like it's going to be

56
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.480
for a friendly face you know
because like this year has been so weird

57
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.000
because
it's

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.840
the weirdest year like i it's been like
five years in four

59
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.080
months um but it basically started out
with my mom dying and she she

60
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.640
that was through assisted suicide so it
was really weird because it was planned

61
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.760
there was a date there was a party
happening at the same time like a going

62
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.040
away party there was

63
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.880
and like people drinking and laughing
and having a good time and then you know

64
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.040
me and robin my mom and my dad and the
doctor went into my mom's bedroom

65
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.520
and she died
as there was a party going on outside

66
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.800
the door kind of celebrating her life
kind of thing it was which is a really

67
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.360
weird way to go but at the same time i
feel like it's really more comforting i

68
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.560
think it's so much more comforting than
like dying in a hospital bed or

69
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.199
something like that like you're
literally

70
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.360
you're you're going
surrounded by people who care i um i

71
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.160
haven't been to a whole lot of funerals
i know you've been more to me but like

72
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.120
i've been into like three
more than me i've been to one um it was

73
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.160
drab um
i have been around people for whom their

74
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.120
loved ones are dying so i've had lots of
proxy death

75
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.320
and
all my funerals have been irish funerals

76
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.919
which are basically like you go to the
church it's sad and then everybody

77
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.440
drinks yeah um this seems like the the
we're calling it a living wake as per

78
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.759
the film yeah hopefully gonna make about
it

79
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.360
um
uh catherine o'hara if you're listening

80
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.080
uh call us if you're a patron
i'd love to cast you in a movie

81
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.000
um
we're calling it a living wake and i i

82
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.960
can see it being a much
better tradition than like any like than

83
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.039
the kind of death approach to death we
do have i agree and i mean like this

84
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.639
might be a controversial topic but like
and if you have a terminal disease

85
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.800
in my brain it's like
go out on your own terms don't don't

86
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.039
waste away like go out when you're not
like my mom at the end was pretty wasted

87
00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.880
away from what she had been just a year
prior yeah but it would have gotten a

88
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.720
whole lot it wasn't going to get any
easier from there yeah and so she was

89
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.479
like no i'm going now
and like even even at the

90
00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.360
the wake people were like she seems fine
i'm like there's there's not a lot she's

91
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.160
not telling people well yeah there were
a lot of people

92
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.360
uh especially people who hadn't been in
her life for a little while

93
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.199
and they were like she seems fine and
like me having obviously been in her

94
00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.199
life my entire life
i i was able to say like

95
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.880
no a year ago this was completely
different yeah um like my mom visiting

96
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.720
two years ago
versus my mom coming up this past

97
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.160
november completely different people
yeah especially your mom was exceptional

98
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.840
putting on a brave face for people like
she didn't want to be an inconvenience

99
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.720
to people she didn't want to be a
trouble for people yeah like she

100
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.880
expected like two or three people to
show up at this like going away thing

101
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.720
and it ended up being a packed house
yeah yeah um

102
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.319
we i think we were past covet capacity
at some points depending on who was

103
00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.680
there oh beyond nobody was wearing masks
and some people weren't vaccinated i

104
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.319
don't know how nobody got sick i think
we did kind of i think we got a very

105
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.479
weak variant of kovid because we but we
threw that uh cold back and forth that

106
00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.840
had called back and forth and that was
like and we had both gotten coveted

107
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.840
early on in 2020 we think we both got
vaccinated double vaccinated we've been

108
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.840
treated as soon as possible as soon as
possible yeah like the like we drove

109
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.440
like an hour out of our way because the
vaccination was taking so long yeah but

110
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.319
um that was in the summer
yeah that was a while ago um and i just

111
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:37.199
want to say like this we you said it's
been five years since um uh january 2022

112
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.639
we're in 2022 right yeah
okay for some reason earlier i thought

113
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.759
we're in 2023 um but
um that's what i mean but it's weird

114
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.000
january two years
february a month

115
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.120
yeah not even like a week like like
because february was basically

116
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.039
nothing two things happened in february
the big things happened but it went by

117
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:05.520
so quickly in february like
there was the whole

118
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.639
uh life insurance thing started
happening where it was like my mom

119
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.360
wanted me to get this portion of her
life insurance specifically so i could

120
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.240
make a movie so that i could you know
make my dreams come true and all that

121
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.960
kind of stuff
and then kind of coming to the

122
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.599
realization early that
rbc insurance is gonna [ __ ] me yeah and

123
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:24.879
[ __ ] my dad
and

124
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.400
like i just i knew it just by the way
they were talking yeah and the way they

125
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.840
were going about things i was trying to
be i was trying to be positive yeah i

126
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.399
was not yeah um one of us one of us had
to be i wrote them off very early on so

127
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.360
that when i actually got the
confirmation that they were [ __ ] us

128
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.919
over
it was less

129
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.160
i am angry
and more like okay now i get to be

130
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.120
spiteful but anyway uh sorry
um i'm just trying to go through a

131
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.240
timeline
um oh time doesn't exist it's a

132
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.200
construct honey let's do it at all
so like i realized okay that's not gonna

133
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.959
happen i
let's see if we can

134
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:07.040
start an indiegogo
to make two short films final girl and

135
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.240
the vampire three thousand dollars each
the money is only to pay the actors yeah

136
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.399
um we'll shoot with the cameras i have
we'll shoot with the equipment we have

137
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:21.200
um and that's that
and i put up the indiegogo

138
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.000
and by the end of it it went up for two
months from uh april

139
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.399
or uh february 15th to april 15th

140
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.760
and it raised like 85 000 within 48
hours we were floored we had surpassed

141
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.080
the goal we had surpassed the goal
within an hour really the six thousand

142
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.480
dollar goal was gone in an hour uh the
the last i posted it we went to costco

143
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.839
by the time we left costco i checked it
and we were at like 10 grand yeah and

144
00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:51.040
you were in tears yeah like i was
driving home like wiping tears in my

145
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.399
eyes because i was like how did this
happen because in my brain i was like

146
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:58.399
oh my god i get i can expand the budget
so that we can pay people i just want to

147
00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:01.600
take a time to sort of address a lot of
like the financial stuff here because

148
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.440
like you know at the same time that you
were basically writing off the insurance

149
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.600
policy from your mom and kind of were
super anxious about how am i going to

150
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.399
fund these films how am i going to
support my dad uh well yeah like my dad

151
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:17.920
gastric bypass like all of these things
that you had been looking forward to

152
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.560
that you were gonna and also you know
taking some of that money and putting it

153
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.240
into a film
um the indiegogo was like the first step

154
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.880
to kind of really being like okay we're
not [ __ ] well yeah because and at the

155
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.200
same time

156
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:37.440
for context
two we had put out two video two youtube

157
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.560
videos at this point yeah when we put
out the indiegogo

158
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.560
one of them was super successful and
youtube demonetizes the banana fish

159
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.920
video the second one was the scarlet
witch video which no that is my least

160
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.720
viewed video on my channel yeah like
just went nowhere and we were like oh

161
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.800
[ __ ]
so then the indiegogo went like crazy

162
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.320
mm-hmm and i was super excited about
that because it meant we could make the

163
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.560
movies but
i never budgeted into that a salary for

164
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.079
us yeah like it was like no we get paid
from youtube videos well yeah youtube

165
00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:14.079
was [ __ ] us well yeah and like i
remember before you put out the call for

166
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:17.920
the patreon you were kind of like um i
want to be clear like you know i last

167
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.519
month was one of those really long
months where it was like years long

168
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:25.519
years past march took forever um just
because we were both

169
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:30.800
so stressed over like the income from
youtube because a lot of um our ability

170
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.560
to shoot these short films that we were
planning hinged on the ability to

171
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.440
sustain ourselves over the summer with
ancillary um money coming in yeah

172
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.680
youtube movie
income coming in from youtube videos

173
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.320
like that was the only way that was
because it was gonna work that was gonna

174
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.519
pay the rent and pay for groceries while
we shot these films with you know

175
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:54.720
donation money yeah because we weren't
we weren't paying ourselves for tellos

176
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.279
we were paying for the from youtube you
had so much fun doing those budgets oh i

177
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:02.639
still do
the other night when i decided vampire's

178
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.079
a feature film i went in and oh i
started doing math yeah more on that

179
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:11.120
later we'll talk about it um had so much
fun oh i love spreadsheets um i didn't

180
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.360
in business school i hated excel but
okay so like we

181
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.440
thought we binged um
what we do in the shadows over like

182
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.399
three days uh the tv show yeah once one
season per day um

183
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:28.800
james so happy that it got renewed james
calling me into his room to talk about

184
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.279
budgets was like a college robinson
like for me

185
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:37.279
like he'd be like guiding me through the
details of like the equations and

186
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:41.040
functions he had in the spreadsheet i'm
like look at this and this one i have

187
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.399
this i have this information and then it
refers to other information

188
00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:50.720
in a different spreadsheet and it auto
updates yeah yeah it's happening to you

189
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.399
guys too now right um
there's someone who's like i know i know

190
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:58.720
what he's i know how he feels there's
someone who gets excited by spreadsheets

191
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.240
well colin robinson would um
oh my god i love that character

192
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.880
um but yeah like
so so march took forever yeah because we

193
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.680
were both super anxious and then like
and i was seeing like the indiegogo

194
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.079
continue to raise more and more and more
like i said get to that like 84 000 but

195
00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:21.600
at the same time the problem was that
was telos money that wasn't

196
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.200
our living aren't living money meanwhile
youtube was just

197
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.160
falling it was that one night when they
demonetized to the the the

198
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.880
recent video yeah um so fast forward to
this month which is going by at a laser

199
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.000
pace yeah that was on the
12th

200
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.600
that i think that they demonetized two
videos

201
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.040
and just boom boom and they were the two
newest videos

202
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.000
which is where most of the bread and
butter comes from yeah with youtube the

203
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.440
newer videos which they have been
remonetized but they got most of their

204
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.800
views while demonetized and so
nothing really came of them but which is

205
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.920
incredibly infuriating it's infuriating
it's frustrating is it going to happen

206
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.440
again i don't know so like you know you
were kind of simultaneous like fury like

207
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.839
because like a maelstrom of emotions you
were just ra you were angry you were

208
00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.079
like
in the email you get from youtube when

209
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.800
they come back and say like we have
remonetized them isn't like [ __ ] we're

210
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.800
sorry we made a [ __ ] up
it's congratulations we've decided your

211
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.519
videos can be monetized and i'm like so
like so like you were just like a ball

212
00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:32.079
of anxiety and i was like i need to put
my head in the sand because i literally

213
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:37.040
that day bought a playstation 5. um so
like i was like half too anxious to

214
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.680
actually enjoy anything that i was
looking at the screen but i was just

215
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.720
kind of just going through the motions
yeah and then i just i came into your

216
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.480
room and i was like i need your ipad
yeah because i had put together a little

217
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.639
thing
and i was like i'm going to put out a

218
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.760
video and see if i can get some more
patrons and if not i'm going to have to

219
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.000
start looking for it like a job yeah
yeah the more patrons we have because

220
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.760
you know the more patrons that have the
less we depend on youtube yeah and so

221
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.720
then i put out the video
basically went to sleep

222
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.480
like and
woke up the next morning and we had gone

223
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.920
from
900 patrons to that to two almost two

224
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.279
thousand and now it's at i think twenty
three hundred well yeah like once again

225
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:20.240
a cost go again it's always a costco we
we went to costco and you were kinda

226
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.680
like we got back in the car and it was
like okay there are 500 notifications in

227
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.760
your email now yeah my email refreshed
and it was like the [ __ ]

228
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.279
it was i i still don't know how to feel
about it um

229
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:34.639
it's it's a weird feeling because it's
basically

230
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.000
because of
you guys

231
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.199
uh you guys and girls and everyone in
between uh [ __ ] and hoes

232
00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:46.800
[ __ ] and bros non-binary hoes

233
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.199
go watch skate if you haven't it's
wonderful

234
00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:55.920
um
because of you we now have the ability

235
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.880
to
put out videos

236
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.959
that we want to make if i was and this
is the weird thing if i was focused on

237
00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:08.880
like i should only make videos that are
monetizable

238
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.639
i wouldn't have done a 20-minute video
that's basically just ranting about

239
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.480
secrets of dumbledore yeah and of course
that's doing fantastically but i

240
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.880
wouldn't have done it because i wouldn't
have think that it would have done well

241
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.519
yeah you know when you're when you get
paid for doing a certain thing you're

242
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:25.279
like okay i need to stick to format
stick to format stick to form like long

243
00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:29.040
videos yeah because the longer the video
the more they the better they usually do

244
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.399
yeah because it's like okay what if we
wasted because the short videos hadn't

245
00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:37.040
done super fantastically no um so it's
like this is and i hadn't put out a

246
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.120
video of this length since 2018. yeah so
like you know going like a video is a

247
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.839
lot of time and energy like you know you
got a comment talking about like if

248
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.959
youtube's not paying you enough then
just don't do it it's like put there's a

249
00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.759
lot of energy that goes into these
things especially because you don't just

250
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:56.160
sit at a desk and talk to the camera
yeah um like we film like for the

251
00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.000
pirates for the uh our flags mean death
flag means flag means death

252
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.799
um
video like

253
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:08.160
i joked on twitter that i i would only
do it if i could shoot it on a boat but

254
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.600
then i started thinking in my head how
can i make it look like it's on a boat

255
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.799
and so we had i ordered you know a
backdrop that was like old weathered

256
00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:20.160
wood
and you know we had like you had a wine

257
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.439
bottle that looked like old-fashioned
and stuff like a rum bottle you were

258
00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:27.439
like oh we can use some candles and then
i did find the got your old glass goblet

259
00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:32.960
though so i'm sad we couldn't use that
but i actually thought yeah i did

260
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.760
and we were like okay we can light some
candles for like the lighting and then

261
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.480
like i was like oh let's put a blue
light through like a sphere not a sphere

262
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.799
like a tub of water we had like a
plastic decanter

263
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.320
i don't know it was like a rubbermaid
anyway so all of the video you know how

264
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.919
that like rippling effect that you see
shining on james that's nick that's my

265
00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:59.280
arm i was so sore after
that's him pumping the water for an hour

266
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.320
at a time
just like you know nudging the thing my

267
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.880
arm was so sore
like i haven't seen anyone comment

268
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.799
just like
that was something while i was filming

269
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:15.679
it i was so proud at how much it looked
like you know water reflecting through a

270
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.880
window at night
um

271
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.679
but yeah but because we put like a lot
of effort into the editing um into the

272
00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:27.120
theatrics like kind of talking about
delivery and stuff so like these are a

273
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.720
lot more theatrics that theatrical than
a lot of others yeah we go over the

274
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.360
scripts over and over again and it's
it's always funny because i never read

275
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.160
them
as we practice the way i read them on

276
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.240
camera yeah and you always expect it to
go one way and it always i'm like wow

277
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.200
then yeah i think it always goes a
different way because when i get on

278
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.440
camera that's when i kind of put on the
the guys yeah the airs performance

279
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.960
um
for camera um but yeah now thanks to you

280
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.840
guys we can do more experimental videos
like the the pocket gaze videos we can

281
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.080
continue to do the normal so much things
more relaxing to have that kind of

282
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.440
stability there like i yeah like the
thing i'm most excited about is

283
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.720
like i can do more videos like pink
triangles now i can do more videos like

284
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.919
making it big they're the ones that i
ping triangles and the gay panic defense

285
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:24.720
were rough to make but they're rewarding
on the other end yeah but like making it

286
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.919
big was so much fun to make yeah um
you got to put porn on youtube

287
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:34.640
well yeah like for a year for
a good year and a half they didn't have

288
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.520
it rated 18 plus
they do now because they kind of

289
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.960
went through my channel and they were
like nope nope nope nope

290
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.720
um
it's like deep cuts has finally been

291
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.600
demonetized
because there's gore in it but that went

292
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.880
for like a year
without them noticing

293
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.880
i mean like when it's um
yeah

294
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.240
i'm honestly surprised the dumbledore
video hasn't been

295
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.600
demonetized
well just because

296
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.799
the whole video is pirated footage
and i think it helps that you release it

297
00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:13.679
on sunday after the video had been after
the movie had been out

298
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.559
like in theaters
so

299
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:20.159
yeah
but like it's almost all pirated footage

300
00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:22.559
and
there's a lot of people in the comments

301
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:27.200
being like you know how dare you say
things that mean things about joanne

302
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.559
and you're on the wrong channel sorry so
it's like i'm surprised that it hasn't

303
00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:36.159
been like reported or something like
that um

304
00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:38.799
but you know fingers crossed doesn't
happen keep going

305
00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:42.720
uh i mean like because there's really
nothing in there that hasn't been in the

306
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.120
trailers yeah there are some shots from
the end of the movie

307
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.520
they've been in the trailers really the
the whole fight between grindelwald and

308
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.840
dumbledore is in the trailers oh my god
warner brothers who used to be good at

309
00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.640
this like they show the whole thing
like you can p it's not all there but

310
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.600
you can piece it together and it's all
there yeah

311
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.120
so it's like it's kind of it's kind of
so lame also so like i just remember

312
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.039
you've seen order of the phoenix
actually i think that's one harry potter

313
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:17.039
movie i don't think it's the the i don't
think i've seen five or six okay at the

314
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:21.120
end of five dumbledore and baltimore
have a fight in the ministry of magic

315
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.080
yeah and it is the best wizard fight in
any of the movies

316
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.480
and it's like
that's the bar now that's like the

317
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.159
empire strikes back do they do the
teleporting in the in the earlier movies

318
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:35.360
like the
okay i kind of liked that um but that's

319
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.880
like that's the empire strikes back
lightsaber fight like that's or duel of

320
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.840
the fates like that that's what
everything is measured by

321
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.760
and
like really you're putting dumbledore

322
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.039
and grindelwald against each other and
they just kind of zip zip around i i do

323
00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:52.480
like the fight teleporting i think
that's a cool effect that's fine yeah i

324
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.159
just mean like but i also think like
this was both of the big magic fights in

325
00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:00.080
this movie between dumbledore dumble
world

326
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.919
those two and then dumbledore and
credence they happened in like mirror

327
00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:07.039
dimensions and like dream worlds where
like yeah one of the things the game

328
00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:10.559
pocket dimensions yeah the gay pocket
dimensions uh where nothing happening

329
00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:14.559
affected the real world and like there
are no consequences here yeah and you

330
00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:17.840
know this movie was a case study in a
consequence i don't know i don't want to

331
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.280
talk about that [ __ ] movie
um

332
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.039
but yeah so now because of that we can
because of the patrons you guys coming

333
00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:29.120
on board we can do more

334
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.960
do more experimental stuff do more
um

335
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.640
we we also don't have to panic as much
about playing to the algorithm because

336
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.320
we don't have to some of our biggest
burns have been like okay like trying to

337
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.280
plan a video like oh my god this thing
is coming out on this date we need to

338
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.400
make sure that this is relevant um you
know leading up to this for this

339
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.400
announcement yeah like even with our
flag our flag means death like i was

340
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.679
like we need to be the first one out and
we weren't we weren't the first person

341
00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:57.679
to get one out but we were
one of the first

342
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:00.799
bigger queer youtube channels to get one
out

343
00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:06.480
and i mean it's it's got like 130 000
views which is you know

344
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.280
i i complain about my view count and so
and a lot of queer youtubers are like

345
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.960
what i would do
to have those numbers when we talk about

346
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.039
um the lack of views even though it's
all about monetizing it's about

347
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:22.480
monetization it's about the ability for
us to sustain ourselves so that we

348
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.600
continue to do things keep in mind this
isn't just james getting paid this is

349
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.080
james and nick getting paid yeah so this
needs to support two people in an

350
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.799
apartment
if we had two apartments that would be

351
00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:35.760
even harder
well yeah like yeah if we were both

352
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.440
paying separate rents um but you know
this patreon thing keeps up we might be

353
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.720
able to move out
move out what do you mean get our own

354
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.400
places i mean like we want to change
like relocate and stuff but well yeah

355
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.600
like my plan is not to sign new leases
here no no um

356
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.159
done with this east coast thing
but uh

357
00:23:56.159 --> 00:24:00.080
yeah like i'm so excited at the prospect
of being able to do more

358
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.760
uh
like hard stuff like queer history and

359
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.080
things like that that just automatically
gets demonetized because it's like oh

360
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.880
you talked about this thing that's you
know

361
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.840
not nice to the gays and i'm like well
i'm sorry but that happened

362
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.000
yeah i'm sorry the queer panic defense
is a thing i mean like you know god

363
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.279
forbid like straight people feel
uncomfortable about shitty things that

364
00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:26.240
they've done in history it's like okay
like you don't have to repeat that

365
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.440
though you could admit that there were
mistakes and move on like you don't have

366
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.919
to make it all about you
um yes so i actually got a question from

367
00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:37.840
a patron today
asking me

368
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.799
um
it will be answered on fridays um

369
00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:47.440
uh or thursdays ama
but um

370
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.679
uh i went for thursday because jesse's
doing one on friday

371
00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:56.480
um but
they said i'm german and we've spent you

372
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.520
know my entire life learning about the
holocaust and everything we did to

373
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.960
jewish people and we never learned
anything about the gays

374
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.679
and then asked would you ever do a video
about that

375
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:13.039
and it just kind of clicked into me that
a video like pink's triangles

376
00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:18.880
is so hidden by youtube that even
subscribers aren't seeing it yep

377
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.440
um
so obviously you know i'll let them know

378
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.919
that hey it's there go watch it you'll
have to click through i think it's four

379
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:31.520
yes i want to watch the screens and if
it like blocks you because you don't

380
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.559
want to give youtube your information or
anything it's on vimeo you can watch it

381
00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:38.880
hearing like gay germans talk about that
video and especially in regards to

382
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.039
youtube burying it and it's like youtube
doesn't bury any

383
00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:46.640
holocaust documentaries on youtube they
don't that they kind of all get no

384
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.200
because it's it's like as long as you're
not denying the holocaust yeah it's like

385
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.440
this is a safe ground so it's definitely
one of those one of these things is not

386
00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:02.480
like the other sort of uh situation oh
my god there was such a sad story um

387
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.440
one of my patrons messaged me
and uh said that she watched the pink

388
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.000
triangle she she's jewish and her
grandmother was actually in the

389
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.039
holocaust
and her great uncle her grandmother's

390
00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:17.039
brother was also in the holocaust but he
was taken first

391
00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:20.080
and
um

392
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.120
he was gay
and she watched the video with her

393
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.960
grandmother who luckily survived her
great uncle didn't yeah and her

394
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.880
grandmother after watching it said i
never knew why he went first

395
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.640
and now she does
and i just kind of i cried a bit because

396
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.120
i was like that's like a 90-year closure
sort of thing well yeah and there's

397
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.279
there is a video
out there

398
00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:47.440
that how is it that someone who survived
it who has

399
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.559
you know spent the last 70 years
reconciling it yeah didn't know that

400
00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:56.720
this whole section of it happened that's
yeah and i we hear a lot about a lot of

401
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.120
german people saying that you know they
are they're in holocaust

402
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.960
holocaust
that is a there is a podcast a

403
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.919
right-wing podcast oh my god oh don't
even uh they're in like holocaust uh

404
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:13.600
history classes in german universities
and they do not cover any of the gay

405
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.200
stuff well yeah it's like they go into
detail about the jews they go into a

406
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.480
little bit of detail about the roma and
they're like and then some gays died

407
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.559
yeah
um

408
00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:25.279
they also don't really talk about people
with disabilities

409
00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:28.320
or black people even
like there were blacks yeah anyway

410
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.480
europe at the time yeah any any any any
people of color really yeah who didn't

411
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.960
fit uh hitler himmler and
their

412
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.440
their what was the other one i'm missing
goebbels

413
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.120
uh well goebbels was a propaganda
propaganda minister he didn't run any

414
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.679
camps in the club um um i'm not saying
that he was a good guy i think he didn't

415
00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:52.799
write he didn't really fit their ethnic
definition of you know german perfection

416
00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:56.159
yeah um because you know hitler was told
tucker carlson's

417
00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:00.880
definition because you know hitler was
male perfection hitler was a looker and

418
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.200
so is tucker carlson you know perfection
i used to think tucker carlson was

419
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.880
really cute
like in around 2002 and three he was

420
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.240
like the conservative on a talk show on
cnn and

421
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.760
i think it was the bow ties or something
i thought he was really cute

422
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.679
i figured what he looks like and i'm
like he hasn't he's not that different

423
00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:25.360
looking but i'm just like was he the one
who was it him or sean hannity who was

424
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.480
sitting there and had the fly crawling
on his face while he was uh that was

425
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.039
hannity hannity yeah lord of the flies
yeah vl's a bub yeah um

426
00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:39.440
i think it was also him who said that um
hillary clinton and barack obama yes

427
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.640
sulfur yes no i think that was uh
the other one

428
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.559
the the the really sweaty one
right anyway uh alex jones i was gonna

429
00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:53.679
say jim jones but no he was a cult
leader it wasn't him anyway going way

430
00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:58.799
way way way back um last year was hard
um

431
00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:04.159
and like 2020 also hard
it's just been a rough time like the

432
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:07.520
last couple of years i i just wanted to
like sort of retouch on you know like

433
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.440
the process of like just completely
losing touch uh with you know the pod

434
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.440
reality like things that didn't
explicitly make money or the things that

435
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.240
weren't money-making or self-care like
we kind of just had to throw those away

436
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.880
yeah uh well not throw them away but
they had to they they had to go by the

437
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.399
wayside yeah um

438
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:32.240
which sucks so can i get back into magic
the gathering someday

439
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.320
yeah like i want to get back into yeah i
miss it i really miss it like i wonder

440
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.559
if we could do like competitive streams
against each other or something

441
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:43.919
where i just flip the table because you
have stupid cards

442
00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:48.159
you have more cards than me yeah but i
don't know how to make them work that's

443
00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.919
why we need to sit down and build a deck
for you but every time i try to do that

444
00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:55.120
you're like yeah just put some cards
together and i'm like james

445
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.600
but um

446
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:07.039
and then upcoming this weekend because

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.080
and just like
gay stories actually can be

460
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.440
innocent queer stories because there's
also a lesbian couple there's a

461
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.960
transgender character
um

462
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.360
and one thing i actually took a picture
of it the like jock rugby player

463
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.640
who the main characters kind of is in
love with

464
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.399
he has a little bit when he's sitting
down he's drawn with a little bit of a

465
00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:21.120
belly
and i just loved that

466
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.159
so much
so that'll be coming out this sunday and

467
00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:29.039
then i think the week after that will be
a video about nintendo

468
00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:33.679
and then there'll be a week break
and then um

469
00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:37.600
the video in nintendo's going to come
out on may 1st right or the first sunday

470
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.679
of may right yeah yeah so i think it's
may 4th

471
00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:44.960
oh may the 4th oh we should have done
the star wars thing

472
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.360
i need to do that's another thing i need
to do a star wars thing um i'm doing a

473
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.039
uh kind of collect uh
video collection with some other

474
00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:55.919
creators about one scene that gives you
hope

475
00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:59.200
and
uh i've chosen the

476
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.720
the end of the last jedi
where you know

477
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.080
yeah the power the great powers that be
out in the universe they're not coming

478
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.760
to save you yeah but you know you have
the power resilience etc yeah um you you

479
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.360
you know scrappy resistance fighters
they're there because we pretend episode

480
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.320
nine doesn't exist so that whole thing
yeah

481
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.840
uh i mean honestly the end of episode is
a better ending for the franchise than

482
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.519
episode it is
sorry if you're kidding everything sorry

483
00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:30.000
if you're not a fan of the last jedi but
you're wrong um

484
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.519
but uh so yeah there's a bunch of stuff
coming and then during the summer we're

485
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:37.039
only going to do the pocket gaze
because we're going to be shooting final

486
00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:41.039
girl during the summer yeah
um and like you also wanted to make the

487
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:44.480
decision to turn vampire into a feature
film which i wanted to talk to you about

488
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.120
and i figured doing on the podcast is
the best of all

489
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.559
just because like uh confronting me in
front of an audience not confronting i'm

490
00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:55.200
surprised like because i read a bit of a
breakdown i wrote a bit of a breakdown

491
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.360
uh just because jotting some sort of
plot beats down um

492
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.360
yeah we basically decided okay the two
short films final girl and vampire i

493
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.159
will take final girl because
slasher movies yeah and then you will

494
00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:12.240
take vampire and final girl is staying
as a short film but i read nick's

495
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.480
breakdown of the first two acts of
vampire and i was like

496
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.519
this as a short film will feel rushed
and like but by all means like if you

497
00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:24.720
wanted to keep being a short film but
that's the thing that's the thing i

498
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.960
budgeted it but did it uh it can be a
feature yeah um

499
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.200
very easily without breaking the telos
budgets okay um

500
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.960
and i think it should be
because

501
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.600
it's basically a movie about two people
yeah and i think giving it 90 minutes to

502
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.799
breathe
is

503
00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:51.279
better yeah i i feel like as i was
writing it like a lot of a lot of my

504
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:55.200
storytelling in general is kind of
geared towards slower burns kind of yeah

505
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.679
digesting ideas which i think for the
thriller with tension is an emotional

506
00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:03.760
thriller is better yeah
so like i i just wanted to start the way

507
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.039
i had a pace in my mind is like bear in
mind like this is me still thinking it

508
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:10.399
was going to be a short film while i was
writing it because i have no idea about

509
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:14.320
how long movies are
um

510
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.280
so i was kind of thinking like yeah this
will all fit i mean imagine if i was

511
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.119
trying to write this as a feature like
it would be like a novel yeah we will uh

512
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:25.280
so maybe do that maybe when it comes to
all of uh the um features that i work on

513
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.679
i'll just think of them like they're
short in their short films

514
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.760
so yeah i do need to replace this the
short film slot with something else

515
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.760
though so
uh yeah we can um

516
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.359
but yeah so
things have been crazy like this year

517
00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:46.320
things have you know
lost and then a little cup some wins and

518
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.599
then more lost i did want to mention
sort of like you know the

519
00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:53.359
you know the combination of like the um

520
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.879
the indiegogo was kind of like a breath
that was like okay we can do these

521
00:34:56.879 --> 00:35:00.839
movies now yeah without the insur the
royal the royal think of canada

522
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:05.599
insurance uh the rbc insurance rbc life
insurance

523
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:10.000
uh deciding just to you know completely
screw the pooch and [ __ ] you over yeah

524
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.320
um that going like
the indiegogo gave us the opportunity to

525
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.839
be like
yeah we can do this yeah there is still

526
00:35:17.839 --> 00:35:21.920
progress available for us that we're you
know it's

527
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.040
that and the thing that you were most
worried about with the insurance was

528
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.520
like how was my dad gonna survive how
how yeah how is your dad gonna you know

529
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.359
get by and it's like
the other day like you're talking to

530
00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:37.599
your dad about something and you just
gave him some money well i didn't just

531
00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:41.760
give him money but he was saying that he
had gotten a call from a credit card

532
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.040
company saying you know you haven't paid
since january which was when my mom

533
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.640
passed my mom took care of the bills
um

534
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.480
and they said you know forget how much
it was but you know x amount is owed

535
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.680
we're going to
lock the card if it's not paid by

536
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.000
saturday and he told me this and i just
paid it yeah so i was like dad i'm just

537
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.200
going to pay it off like i'm not going
to go i'm just i'm going to pay it off

538
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.000
and take care of it
and he was like

539
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.119
you can do that and i was like yeah yeah
so i will take care of it because of

540
00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:13.920
patreon you can now kind of pick up i
can take care of my dad yeah for what

541
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.839
the insurance would have been doing so
this is kind of it really is amazing

542
00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:21.280
yeah it's not giving him the lump sum he
would have had where he could pay off

543
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.079
the car and stuff like that so that he
wouldn't have as many bills to worry

544
00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:28.880
about but i can help when he needs it
which is a big big big relief off my

545
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.320
shoulders i don't think he likes the
idea because he doesn't like the idea of

546
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.480
your kid helping you i mean like that
very old school thought process once

547
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.880
again like when it comes to people of a
certain age like that's kind of what the

548
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.160
social expectation needs to be it's like
you know like when your parents are in

549
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.119
your old age it's time for the kids to
take care of yeah like my dad is 69

550
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:50.480
years old
his back and neck have been broken he is

551
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.960
not super mobile
and he can't read or write

552
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.119
he's sorry i need i need to help you he
needs to you know learn to accept and my

553
00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:03.040
half-sister is a [ __ ]
um

554
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.040
i know a lot of people don't like that
word but if oh the stories i could tell

555
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.079
the horrible things i mean you also come
from the most scott one of the most

556
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:15.200
scottish parts of canada so like
yeah so it's kind of a you know given

557
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.920
phrase my mom just to kind of throw it
out there

558
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.160
she
um spill that tea yeah i'm not gonna say

559
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:28.000
her name or anything but she um
i grew up with her as my sister up until

560
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.680
i was about well no sister like really
okay she came over all the time

561
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.480
like until i was about
five or six and she was graduating from

562
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.320
high school
um so considerably older oh yeah she was

563
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.720
way older she was from my dad's first
marriage

564
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.560
um
and uh

565
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.200
so
she when she was graduating from high

566
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.320
school um
my mom went out and bought her like this

567
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.960
like thousand dollar jacket for her to
take away to college with her

568
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.400
um
like my mom put money away for months

569
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.880
and months and months and months and
months and months and borrowed money to

570
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.320
buy this jacket for yeah yeah um
doing surgeries the thing with canadian

571
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.200
uh
well at least proms from where i am is

572
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.320
that there's a dance beforehand called
the grand march and it's where every all

573
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.040
the graduates basically walk around a
gym

574
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.880
and then they dance with if you're a guy
you dance with your mom if you're a girl

575
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.720
you dance with your dad sorry microphone
that sounds like such a weird it's very

576
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.480
old-fashioned but that's the way it
works

577
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.800
um
she decided

578
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.119
i don't want your jacket
and i'm taking my mom's boyfriend to

579
00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:46.960
this dance
uh instead of her dad my dad um

580
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.880
so that broke my dad's heart she refused
to talk to him for years

581
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.560
um
there is no reasoning for this no one

582
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.040
knows like we have looked into this
there is no reasoning for her to be like

583
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.560
this uh later when she had a kid
she

584
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.920
showed up again
um because now she had a kid and she was

585
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.240
like oh you know you can you know be in
his life and stuff and my dad was super

586
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.200
excited oh he's gonna have a grandson
and stuff

587
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:18.400
and so
for the kids first christmas

588
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.520
um
my dad bought the kid a bunch of stuff

589
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.359
me and my mom bought a bunch of stuff

590
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.280
she
disappeared

591
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.800
before i disappeared before christmas
before he got any of it before the kid

592
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.480
got any of it disappeared and then
my father heard back

593
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.240
from someone else that we're related to
from her where she said yeah i don't

594
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.119
need them i don't we don't need their
stuff

595
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:50.079
and
later on did the same like this has been

596
00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:54.640
like a repeating process but like she's
missing out on so much free stuff well i

597
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.640
know but this is a repeating process
with her like i don't understand

598
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.480
the thought process at all like i have
two nephews i've never met

599
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.160
um
wow

600
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.960
my dad has two grandchildren he's never
met

601
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.839
and
like the thing that's confusing to

602
00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:15.680
everyone is my dad's not a bad guy
and we know for like a fact that there

603
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.480
was like nothing that he ever abused her
or anything yeah your dad seems way too

604
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.119
passive wait late and we know for like
she has said when because like my one of

605
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.319
my cousins asked her like what the hell
like

606
00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:31.839
did he do something to you she's like no
i just don't need him

607
00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:36.960
and it's like
and so like the assumption is that like

608
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.599
her mom
who

609
00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:43.440
was my dad's first wife was very spurned
by my dad leaving her for a younger

610
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.119
woman
that she over the years kind of

611
00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:49.040
poisoned
yeah

612
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.640
the thought process anyway yeah so
that's why the c word is justified um i

613
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.599
mean my mom and this is funny about like
you know i apologize for using it for

614
00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:59.839
anyone who is the
sensitive to that uk mindset growing up

615
00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:03.920
like the c word um i love saying it it's
one of my favorite words but out of

616
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.680
respect for others
um so it was it was a that is

617
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.319
specifically like women specifically are
very kind of

618
00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:16.240
put off by it and it's like one of the
go-to words for gay men so that's

619
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.920
problem
um and i'm as i'm learning one of the

620
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.079
more um
universally acknowledged terms uh that

621
00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:27.839
trans men use
oh yeah yeah i see that um it's

622
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:31.920
apparently it's more masculinizing than
a lot of other words oh yeah then like

623
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.440
[ __ ] or something
um

624
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.680
vagina um
a little amy schumer humor there for you

625
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.520
before she gets cancelled again uh she
was canceled already again from the

626
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.720
oscars she did something
oh you don't remember uh she was going

627
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.359
to make a joke about how right don't
look up uh more like don't look down the

628
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:55.359
barrel of alec baldwin's shotgun and
it's like amy

629
00:41:55.359 --> 00:42:00.000
yeah the producers actually like were
like let's not do that yeah and then she

630
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.280
said it after like you know producers
are like amy we don't want to get you

631
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.079
canceled and she's like fine well i'm
going to cancel myself yeah i'll do it

632
00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:09.440
i'll do it myself
uh i don't really have an opinion on amy

633
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.520
schumer but that's just like um
i am neutral negative probably net

634
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.280
negative just on her like i don't have
any positive opinions but i've heard a

635
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.359
couple negative things i don't care
enough about her yeah honestly

636
00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:27.040
um but um
but yeah like my mom started dating so i

637
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.480
was going to say something no seriously
um

638
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.280
my mom started dating a guy from the uk
it's now she throws it around all the

639
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.520
time
me growing up where i was no swear word

640
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.640
was off limits
honestly the only swear word that i

641
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.960
never heard
was [ __ ]

642
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.280
from anyone in my family anyone in the
circle i heard that one never heard it i

643
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.119
heard fruit fruit was the one they went
for like

644
00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.760
oh yeah he's a bit of a fruit i i've
never

645
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.800
once heard
the f word

646
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.520
yeah in its full form uh referring to
you know

647
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.400
i never heard that described
specifically as an insult at queerness

648
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.800
queer people or specifically you know i
got bullied for being gay

649
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.040
before i knew i was gay before anyone
really in elementary school when no one

650
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.480
had a sexuality i got bullied for being
gay i want an elementary height of

651
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.440
sexuality
it was like you know i did

652
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.880
you're special if you read my
autobiography that might be coming out

653
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.440
but like i only ever heard it used as a
derogative against random people it was

654
00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.280
never specifically targeting queerness
which is weird uh also one of my

655
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.640
favorite slurs um
so i never use that word

656
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.720
i get worried that when i do you get
uncomfortable i don't get uncomfortable

657
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.000
and like i'm not even really offended by
it i just

658
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.480
it's not a word i use
um

659
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.800
for some reason i don't know why
uh i just love slurs

660
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.680
but yeah just i i have grown up in a
very sweary environment so the fact that

661
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.160
i can actually like specifically queer
slurs they're all so fun

662
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.160
yeah
we have very colorful slurs against us

663
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.760
yeah
like carpet muncher ah

664
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.079
what
the british budget fudge back fudge

665
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:32.160
packer great one
puff like what

666
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.920
the cream puff chris puff comes
from what like that's so fantastic oh i

667
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.200
think i get the cream puffs yeah it's
it's because

668
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.359
yeah

669
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.960
no that makes sense
um

670
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.800
but yeah so it's been a crazy couple of
months oh and there was the book that

671
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.880
was supposed to happen oh my gosh that
last year in 2021

672
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.359
which
part of my brain is like oh that was

673
00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:01.839
only like a couple of weeks ago no that
was four months ago um i am we were

674
00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:06.640
approached by a publisher in canada who
wanted to take the video essays and turn

675
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.480
them into a book of essays they were
very very excited the editor was very

676
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.160
excited she she has been very nice the
entire time but apparently the the

677
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.480
editor's above her i'm not mad at her
i'm not at the you know

678
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.920
the editors above her have been like
dragging their feet and dragging their

679
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.040
feet
and

680
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.920
i'm just like
maybe i'll just self-publish a book of

681
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.280
essays
because i love the idea of it because

682
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.880
i've always always wanted to be an
author but i have such a hard time

683
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.280
writing fiction the problem with this is
because i write i like the i

684
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.880
my writing style is very condensed and i
feel like fiction isn't worth reading

685
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.800
if it's not a certain page count
and

686
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.839
like i have several books that are in
the 30 to 40 000 word range

687
00:45:55.839 --> 00:46:00.560
um
that i just can't finish because i'm

688
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.920
like oh god i gotta get them to a
hundred thousand that's so much

689
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:09.040
um i mean like most self most books are
like within the forty to eighty thousand

690
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.560
word range no no no no the first harry
potter book is eight is a hundred

691
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.960
thousand words
really yeah and yet self-publishing and

692
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.200
yet professional publishing is pushing
for y a authors to be under forty

693
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.160
thousand
not under forty three i heard that's a

694
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.560
novella
well yeah like i am um

695
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:34.079
it's under 80 000. okay because i was
reading about uh one author who

696
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:37.599
had a book that was 50 000. the
publisher came back and said we need to

697
00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:42.480
we do you can you do it in less words
well i know the the authors i follow

698
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.200
their books are not short um and they
write queer why a and stuff so

699
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.640
but um
so i'm i'm bad at writing fiction most

700
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.480
of the fiction ideas you're bad at
writing prose like should say because

701
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.079
you're good at screenplays well yeah
like and it's not that i'm bad at

702
00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:02.560
writing prose it's just i skip over a
lot of stuff that authors don't like i

703
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.880
skip over a lot of detail that i feel
like is ancillary and i'm all about it

704
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.520
that doesn't mean you're bad at right at
writing that like because that is a

705
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.000
style of book yeah i write like what
happens and what people say what someone

706
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.960
looks like what they're wearing what
something tastes like i'm like that i

707
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.800
don't care um
and that's why things so like the books

708
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.520
that i've written i would like to turn
them into movies because

709
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.680
the books that i've half-written but
writing my autobiography

710
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.040
my memoir memoirs um is actually going
really well and i think it's because i

711
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.480
can write in that just sort of
off-the-cuff really quick

712
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.200
way
and get a lot of story told really

713
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.520
quickly
um so i think i am going to actually

714
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.599
like finish that because there's stories
worth hearing in there can i tell you

715
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:52.880
just how
frustrated i am with that publishing

716
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.680
process
um just like getting started traditional

717
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.280
publishing well like the thing like
getting approached by an agent when we

718
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.359
put out the china video that's when
she's an agent an editor an editor uh

719
00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:08.000
that's when she approached us
um and you know um so that was no very

720
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.440
grateful for her and her interests and
all the work she's put into this but

721
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.359
like catherine she she's been she's been
wonderful and very very sweet it's like

722
00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:19.440
whoever is managing it the kind of
counsel behind the people above her the

723
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.960
people like there's like a board of
directors yeah the decision makers at

724
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.839
the at the publisher and it's just this
is because she really was excited about

725
00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:32.640
it this is such an inefficient process
yeah we could have had this

726
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.599
in the barrel by now well yeah the book
could have been finished because we were

727
00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:38.559
going to write extra chapters for it
obviously book exclusives and i'm glad

728
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:41.599
you told us told me to wait to write
those things until you got any

729
00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:44.640
confirmation back because like although
no we'd have videos yeah you could make

730
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.520
because now like it's the amount of time
we've been like kind of just twiddling

731
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.040
our thumbs and sticking our hands on
this like

732
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.960
it's been ridiculous like
it's it's been

733
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.480
and apparently getting ghosted by uh
that's the thing

734
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.400
is not
common a lot of people are approached by

735
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.680
uh editors
and even when when they have agents

736
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.400
going through agents yeah they're
approached by editors they go through

737
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.280
months and months and months of back and
forth with editors and then just they

738
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.760
disappear they disappear and it's like
that like when you're looking at author

739
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.359
is my chosen field that i want to do it
is so discouraging that it's such a slap

740
00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:24.640
in the face i mean it happens in
hollywood all the time oh yeah like you

741
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.319
people will take a meeting with you to
talk about your screenplay so they can

742
00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:31.839
write off lunches and business but i
mean like that's also been part of the

743
00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:35.119
tradition of hollywood and when you go
into screenwriting and stuff you can you

744
00:49:35.119 --> 00:49:39.040
know that you countermand that when you
go into that because every time you meet

745
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.640
that development executive yeah now you
got their phone number yeah and like and

746
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.000
i i love i love the culture of that
because like when you go to meet that

747
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.119
executive development that he's doing
just for a free lunch don't sell your

748
00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:52.640
script sell yourself
yeah because then if the script if

749
00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.000
they're like not interested in all in
your script and then they're like [ __ ]

750
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.119
we need someone to rewrite the
transformers movie yeah it's like oh

751
00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:02.640
this guy actually is a really good
writer let's hire him yeah and then you

752
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.000
have a job and you have a job and it's
all about selling yourself not the

753
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.720
property yeah because hollywood is a
business of friends yeah it it it isn't

754
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.720
it is it it isn't a profession it isn't
a professional industry it's a business

755
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.240
of friends well yeah it's hollywood is a
very small town yeah it's how it's

756
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.240
described
um small town in a big city

757
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.319
but hollywood though oh yeah hollywood
but l.a

758
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.520
but like hollywood the movie-making
industry is a small town it's a

759
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.400
neighborhood everybody knows each other
yeah everybody who works on movies knows

760
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.160
each other and that's why it's like if
you're someone who's below the line like

761
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.559
if you're not like a christian bale and
you piss someone off you do something

762
00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:47.839
rude you show up late everybody knows
about it yeah um

763
00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:50.880
but if you're if you're easy to get
along with everybody knows that too well

764
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.800
yeah it's like you need the two out of
the three things you have to be great

765
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.480
or easy to get
great great easy to get along with and

766
00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:02.319
punctual and punctual you only knew up
to three you only need two yeah and you

767
00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.800
will keep people around if you're all
three

768
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.280
then
you're me huh

769
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.040
no i don't know how easy to get along
with a long way to get along with so i'm

770
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:18.079
i'm easy to get along with and i have
moments of exceptionalness moments

771
00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:21.760
punctuality though yes that's the one i
don't have you're late to the meetings

772
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:28.400
that you scheduled i am leaning into the
other two very heavily

773
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.960
one thing i am good with i think i'm
punctual to a fault i am early and i

774
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.640
have a problem with that putting videos
out early and then one thing that i am

775
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.319
good with i think this matters more than
like being on time to like meetings i'm

776
00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:44.079
good with deadlines
yeah if i give you a deadline you do

777
00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:49.599
meet the deadline yeah um
whereas with me

778
00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:53.920
i i i don't like saying that it's like
oh i'm exceptional like i think i'm

779
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.880
relatively easy to get along with um
you have your moments no one in film

780
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.520
school who was in my group left my group
so that's kind of my

781
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.079
and the people i made movies with in in
like high school i'm still like

782
00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:12.079
if not like close friends with them we
still talk yeah so it's like you're good

783
00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:15.119
at networking
well no i think i i mean like i mean

784
00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:18.400
that in the most cold corporate way
possible like that's kind of why i don't

785
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.480
think i'm good at networking that's kind
of what that skill is um i keep getting

786
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.720
messages on linkedin from like
production companies across canada

787
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.160
who are like hi i'm i do this thing and
one of them was from australia and i was

788
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.559
suddenly like oh could i move to
australia i don't want to move to

789
00:52:34.559 --> 00:52:37.760
australia i love australia i love
australia really expensive it's

790
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:42.559
expensive and bugs
yeah a lot of bugs and weird large

791
00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:47.680
things large large bugs and adorable
things that will kill you and

792
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.200
the most dangerous like i love the
charts it's like you know australians

793
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.119
what people think i'm afraid of it's
crocodiles and spiders and snakes it's

794
00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:58.640
like what i'm actually afraid of a
magpie

795
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.839
oh they're vicious there have you ever
seen videos of people getting attacked

796
00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:07.200
by magpies and no i have a favor of
birds bagpies yeah don't we're not going

797
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.200
to australia then because magpies will
swoop down and go for your eyes

798
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.880
they are very terri
european magpies different story they

799
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.000
are wonderful gregarious little crows
they're

800
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.640
relatively friendly but like they're
very smart and intelligent um

801
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.480
uh australian magpies are very
intelligent but they will also murder

802
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.040
you if they could like and they follow
you like blocks away like i've had i've

803
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:35.839
had a fear of
birds since i was very little my

804
00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:40.240
my i was i can't remember if i was with
my mother or if it was just a story she

805
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.680
was eating a hot dog and in sitting in
the car with the door down and a seagull

806
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.440
flew in the window grabbed the hot dog
out of the bun and pulled it out and

807
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:55.119
flew away i saw a video of a seagull
swallowing a live baby rabbit

808
00:53:55.119 --> 00:53:58.800
in the wild like just you know like
picking it up

809
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.520
yeah seagull goals never never once but
then at the same time and like i'm still

810
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.000
kind of like even like seagulls i'm
still like i don't go around them um but

811
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.200
like rogue
rose crows ravens blue jays like corvids

812
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.079
all three those all three of those
things yeah it's like i'm totally fine

813
00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:18.960
with them they seem chill they're
respectful

814
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.400
but magpies are also corvettes so like
you know australia different rules yeah

815
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:27.119
australia different rules like if if a
koala grew up in north america it would

816
00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:30.720
not be
that evil

817
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.839
it's funny talking about people from
australia they're talking about north

818
00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:37.119
america it's like yeah you guys are
afraid of our animals but like you've

819
00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:44.960
got grizzly bears and cougars and like i
have pet cougars oh i have pet black

820
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.240
bears
like i'm not afraid of large betty white

821
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.160
had a pet grizzly bear yeah like
like colors are pretty docile things

822
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.839
when they're not hungry pictures of it's
like wolves russians with their pet

823
00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:02.640
bears yeah but it's like it's like
wolves you wolves are if they're not

824
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.079
hungry they're not like their dog's
gonna tear your throat out yeah and that

825
00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:10.559
was one thing as a kid sorry keep
bumping my cable um as a kid i was

826
00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:14.960
petrified like even petrified because i
had a german shepherd german shepherd

827
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.839
mix because my parents were like oh he's
a little boy he should have a dog so

828
00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:20.720
when i was like three i had a german
shepherd mix because he was kind of

829
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.640
weird
and was like she she her

830
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.599
i can't remember i don't know like do
dogs have gender who knows i'm pretty

831
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:30.799
sure
his name i had named him brutus so i'm

832
00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:37.200
assuming that it was a boy um but one
day out in the snow he just glommed onto

833
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.720
the top of my head and the only reason
like

834
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.200
like i wasn't just bleeding profusely
was because of the the snow cap i had on

835
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.760
um
so then you know he was taken to the

836
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.480
spca or whatever um but so because of
that i was petrified of dogs if a dog

837
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.920
was walking down the street i would
cross the street my dog was the first

838
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.920
one that really kind of no no he wasn't
the first one there was um when i was in

839
00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.119
business because you're still a little
bit freaked out about bear when you were

840
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:06.000
at my place yeah
like when his first year of business

841
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.599
school our neighbors got a golden
golden lab

842
00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:12.319
um
and

843
00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:16.559
he was super duper sweet he was such a
nice dog but i would still only go near

844
00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:21.040
him because he was on a leash
so that i was still very like hesitant

845
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.119
um your dog bear was the first one that
i was okay with not on a leash and now

846
00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:30.400
i'm like i want a pit bull
i want a doberman desensitization theory

847
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.200
uh therapy yeah um what are we talking
about before this i have no idea we

848
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.640
should end the podcast here though it's
almost an hour um

849
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.640
sorry for the just completely
random rambling for an hour i didn't

850
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.280
want to talk more about like the
upcoming telus projects but i guess we

851
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.960
can do that in its own podcast
well the upcoming one so we've got final

852
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.599
girl
that's shooting this summer and will be

853
00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:57.599
out in october
we've got mystery short film mystery

854
00:56:57.599 --> 00:57:01.119
short film that will be out in early
2023

855
00:57:01.119 --> 00:57:06.000
and then
uh she comes at night is due next

856
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.839
which will be
spring of 2023 i think

857
00:57:10.839 --> 00:57:14.319
um
and nothing is really

858
00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:17.599
hard scheduled after that
i mean we could probably put a hard

859
00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:23.040
schedule on the now feature vampire
i don't know no no

860
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.280
um
i don't know or i guess it's smart to

861
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.359
just not to over clock ourselves until
we get some yeah

862
00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:36.160
like i think
two shorts and a series slash feature

863
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.440
is uh
and on top of all of the stuff we have

864
00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.880
planned for youtube which is now three
videos a month and honestly like with uh

865
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.319
just like how the kind of way i want to
approach vampire through like subtlety

866
00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:48.640
and like visual storytelling it would be
nice to have a little bit more

867
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.559
experience with smaller projects before
i really launched into that exactly

868
00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:55.119
because like i want it to be a little
bit like

869
00:57:55.119 --> 00:58:00.640
thematically ambitious because final
girl i am very comfortable with because

870
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.640
like casting robin in the lead role who
i've been friends with robin for years

871
00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.240
she's a great actress
meet robin we should i would need

872
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.400
another microphone we have we have so
many so many microphones james um i just

873
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.400
bought two microphones specifically for
the podcast so hopefully they sound good

874
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.680
yeah um i mean they sound good in my
ears yeah

875
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.760
but um like i've worked with robin she's
a fantastic actress she's been acting

876
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.319
classes so she's even better now than
she was when i last worked with her um

877
00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:32.079
and i know she and her acting classes
hasn't done anything with them like she

878
00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:36.240
and i work together really well yeah and
i know that doing horror that's kind of

879
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:40.880
my bag and so i'm like i'm very
comfortable with the idea of final girl

880
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.920
so that's like that's why that's the
first one that's

881
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.319
you know because it's like my safety
blanket movie

882
00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:52.400
and then after that
i cut like i kind of for the second

883
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.880
short film i kind of want to come up
with something that is just bat [ __ ]

884
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.280
like completely out of my comfort zone
like something like a period piece

885
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.240
taking place in greece especially
because like i don't know if you'd be

886
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.040
able to pull that no but i'm just saying
like something completely out there

887
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.079
let's see if i can pull it we went over
the roster and we're like is this too

888
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:14.720
horror heavy like
and it is it is very horrible because

889
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.680
even like she comes at night isn't a
horror movie

890
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.400
but it's close to one yeah like same
feels going in there yeah

891
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.040
so you know it's it's it wouldn't be
i think

892
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.839
dissimilar from like a seven yeah so
like i think we should take some time to

893
00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:37.839
sort of like sit down and kind of ponder
about things that don't necessarily need

894
00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:42.720
to be horror because
star isn't horror no no star is more um

895
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.880
romance almost romance no personal
discovery

896
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.200
um
i think just like genre music star is

897
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.520
discovered to be transgender dropped by
her label moves home and finds out that

898
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.839
uh her label sucks but her fans are
still there

899
00:59:58.839 --> 01:00:05.359
spoilers it's a short film
there's no spoilers for a short film

900
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.319
but that's sort of the future of telos
sorry james is triggered by people

901
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:15.760
calling for spoiler warnings so i really
am god it pisses me off

902
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.960
uh like i think that's even why you
don't like you know disclaimers at the

903
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.559
beginning of books because like it tells
you what's in the book well yeah like um

904
01:00:24.559 --> 01:00:29.200
uh what are they called content warnings
content warnings yeah like i

905
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.760
put a content warning at the beginning
of the killing stalking video

906
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.400
i think that's the only one i think the
hannibal video because we talk about

907
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.680
similar like abusive relationships sort
of situations there i don't know that

908
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.240
was so much a content warning is just
kind of a general maybe

909
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.319
thing yeah i like to keep my content
like uh i i put oh and i did one at the

910
01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:52.640
beginning of uh the queer panic video
yeah because i was like you know what no

911
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.319
this
needs it um i remember having a bit of a

912
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.920
debate when putting a content warning in
front of gentlemen's club yeah i still

913
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.559
don't think there should be a content
warning in front of that honestly i

914
01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:05.359
don't
either but a lot of the content warning

915
01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:09.200
there is kind of just discussing that
hey like kind of

916
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.640
preemptively having a discussion about
like you know like there's gender

917
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.920
related content in here i know this is a
bit of a hot button here are my

918
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.960
intentions for this yeah please don't
come for me um and it's basically i i i

919
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.960
the thing that sold you was like i'd
rather have this discussion here than in

920
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.960
the comment sections on twitter
yeah yeah um

921
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.799
it's like with the latest video the the
rowling one i've gotten not called out

922
01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:36.319
but a lot of people have pointed a lot
of asexual people have kind of come

923
01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:41.040
forward pointing out like i know you
were quoting rowling in the video but i

924
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.720
wish you had
kind of made that clearer yeah and

925
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.720
that's on me because i take
the ridiculousness of that uh for

926
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.240
granted from rowling that dumbledore
became asexual yeah um

927
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.760
like even when you're younger and like
kind of screwing around to see what fits

928
01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.039
you kind of always have a disdain for
sex so it's never something that really

929
01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:05.280
just happens it's uncomfortable not
having in general or as an asexual

930
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.920
person okay
it's it's let's say like oh i can't ever

931
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.480
have sex and you just sort of realize
yeah i'm comfortable not having it yeah

932
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.839
and i mean even even that i think that
was just

933
01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:23.680
her uneducated yeah wording yeah um and
like i honestly which is probably

934
01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.799
probably giving her way too much credit
but i i know i i i'm

935
01:02:26.799 --> 01:02:30.000
just because someone is trash in one
area doesn't mean that everything they

936
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.920
are is trash like she's allowed to sort
of be distant there but like you know i

937
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.799
think i think it's he here's one coming
up he's kind of checking all the boxes

938
01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:44.240
lately yeah but i think that when it
comes to that we need to distinguish

939
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.920
someone's actual problematicness from
inference and other things like there

940
01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.520
are plenty of reasons that jk rowling's
given us to you know indicate that she's

941
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.200
as trash as she is we don't need to like
dig into other things that are kind of

942
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.520
on the fence uh focus on things that
she's actually doing and this i feel

943
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.520
this way about all people it's like you
know like if you don't like this person

944
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.440
not everything they say is terrible we
need to focus on specific things and i

945
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.240
do want to say like anyone who's
listening who has kind of pointed that

946
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.839
out to me in the comments please no i'm
not frustrated or anything like that

947
01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:19.200
like because like i appreciate
i especially appreciate it because no

948
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.000
one has been like antagonistic about it
which is a much nicer reaction than with

949
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.119
the shipping video
uh yeah and like um but like i've talked

950
01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:30.640
to some of the people who were
frustrated with the shipping video

951
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.480
and like they've kind of voluntarily
given me like a big description of like

952
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.760
what the how they
felt was what what they felt was wrong

953
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.000
with it and stuff like that and i'm like
i really appreciate this because now i

954
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.920
have this
like going forward for context and stuff

955
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.960
so
the shipping video i'm i i liked a lot

956
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.880
of the content we put out in that one i
love that video but like i do feel like

957
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.319
there did need to be a little bit more
sensitivity probably there which is

958
01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:02.000
mostly on me for for that
um

959
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.520
especially i i mean i i should have you
know

960
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.440
been more clear
and like double checked like gender and

961
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.319
stuff like that i think that that was
the shipping video that was in the

962
01:04:12.319 --> 01:04:15.520
period when we were just trying to rush
them out as fast as possible yeah

963
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.480
because the shipping one especially
was coming out

964
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.720
i think the shipping one came out
well we needed to get something out to

965
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.200
make money because youtube was just like
i think that was the first one after the

966
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.680
um banana fish banana fish video so we
needed to that was emergency mode so

967
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.000
that's why a lot of it it was rushed
yeah um i think a lot of our points were

968
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.720
very
valid

969
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.119
um you know to bring up i just wish that
we had taken the time to kind of go over

970
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:48.400
it a little bit more and not been in
panic mode to write the entire thing

971
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.160
yeah and that's one thing that i'm very
grateful for is that going forward the

972
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.160
way we kind of have it is that basically
nick has

973
01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.760
a whole month now to write the videos
and not he's not you know you're not the

974
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.200
only person writing yeah yeah
um but like i'll i'll be helping with

975
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.920
shorter ones and i them to focus on the
longer ones yeah and so even though

976
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.119
we're putting out three videos a month
um

977
01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:17.280
most months
it's not overwhelming yeah yeah and it

978
01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:22.400
gives me something to focus on while i'm
twiddling my thumbs yeah um because

979
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.039
that's been a bit of a problem is like i
do a lot of the writing and you do like

980
01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:29.119
all the editing stuff so like yeah and
then when i start editing it's not like

981
01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:32.480
okay you know i'm gonna start editing on
monday and hopefully done on friday i'm

982
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.160
just like no 20 hour days just sitting
at final cut so like you know like

983
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.599
there's not really much break that i
have between one video and the next

984
01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:42.319
because as soon as i finish writing one
video

985
01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:45.440
um i get basically have to go into the
next one because you just edit that

986
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:51.280
quickly so yeah and i mean nick is going
to be there is going to be

987
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.039
a break given to nick because for the
last year and a half you have not gotten

988
01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:58.160
a vacation
so the last few months i've been in

989
01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.680
constant i've been in burnout mode for
about a month now so i really need so

990
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.280
for may and june
nick is going to be taking

991
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.359
his two months vacation because
as a let's let's just say the telos

992
01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:16.160
umbrella um everyone gets two months
paid vacation

993
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.000
um i don't know when mine's gonna be
but you know

994
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.960
the employee
i mean like only one right less than

995
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.760
vacation it would be really cool if we
could actually

996
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.920
i need a mental health leave so mostly
so i can figure out how to learn a um

997
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.280
how to write fiction again fiction again
specifically screenplays i need to

998
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.880
figure out how to write those but like
work on you focus on your books yeah i i

999
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.520
i feel bad today i mean i talked i
mentioned this i feel bad because i

1000
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.119
wanted to sit down to sort of be like i
have a short story idea sort of clinging

1001
01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:47.200
around to my head i'm gonna see if i can
judge anything nothing yeah like i just

1002
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.160
i no ideas were coming out and part of
that is because i'm going through it

1003
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.599
it's a short story it has to do with
lettuce i don't know what it spells what

1004
01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:58.880
you're supposed to write um
it's about a guy who is uh living in the

1005
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.000
past and the future in the same time and
he does he's not sure whether he's

1006
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.280
living in the future and look and
getting flashbacks or whether he's

1007
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.160
living in the past and getting
proficient

1008
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.720
we have a sound board sorry i just
discovered that this has a sound board

1009
01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:22.960
oh yeah james
this is how disinterested he was and

1010
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.940
what i was talking about this is how he
signals

1011
01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:32.159
[Applause]

1012
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:37.520
[Music]
okay um sorry what were you saying just

1013
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.760
um you know
lettuce is

1014
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.160
and we'll probably grow after the
apocalypse so

1015
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.680
james stop will it
i don't know like that's this felt main

1016
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.920
character's reasoning for why he eats oh
right yeah you explained

1017
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.480
okay so
but yeah i tried to read some of that i

1018
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.440
was so discouraged because my head is
like full of fuzz and i think it's

1019
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.559
partly because i'm on like a video game
hangover i woke up today and felt

1020
01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:09.720
literally hungover james don't touch
that sound board

1021
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.370
[Laughter]
um

1022
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:20.159
[Music]
yeah so like i was just really

1023
01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:24.960
discouraged and i felt really really bad
and cause like i i'd love to be able to

1024
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.839
just be able to write on call but i
haven't written any fiction

1025
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:33.279
from
i don't think it's february yeah and so

1026
01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:37.199
i'm i'm discouraged
well

1027
01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:40.960
you're going to have two months to
encourage yourself

1028
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.159
encourage not re-courage
um

1029
01:08:44.159 --> 01:08:47.839
while i
work on movie stuff

1030
01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:51.120

that you want to hear me talk about i
mean honestly i'm the one who's better

1045
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.760
at talking about something forever
so yeah there's a lot of times it's like

1046
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.960
we have this podcast idea like you're
like i can't talk about that and i'm

1047
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.239
like yeah i can though yeah and then
like an hour and 20 minutes later i'm

1048
01:10:04.239 --> 01:10:07.440
like i'm gonna have to cut some stuff
out of this

1049
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.640
but uh
again thank you so much for listening

1050
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.199
thank you for being patrons you are
amazing you basically saved us a massive

1051
01:10:15.199 --> 01:10:19.679
headache and giving us a huge
opportunity to you saved our lives like

1052
01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:24.640
i with how pa with how youtube was going
i i was going to have to

1053
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.480
go find a corporate marketing job where
i would be selling people things they

1054
01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.760
really don't want and that's a very
depressing job that's a depressing job

1055
01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:40.239
so thank you guys so much
we are going to put out lots of stuff um

1056
01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:43.679
to
like a movie club and a book club and

1057
01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:48.560
there's going to be a bunch of stuff um
imagine having like what like 20 000

1058
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.360
patreon patrons and then like like
contra point says 10 000 patrons i was

1059
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.960
trying to sub tweet her but you know
like talking she puts she has 10

1060
01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.280
thousand patrons and like it's taking
her five months to edit this new video

1061
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.000
because she has like something like
eight months since her last video she

1062
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.560
has like five terabytes of like footage
and i'm like girl get organized yeah i

1063
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.640
just i tweeted at her i was like what
codec are you filming in like cause i

1064
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.880
think what she does is computer
she films all of these things separately

1065
01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.040
because she's doing a debate
but she's probably editing off of an

1066
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.040
external
hard drive just reverse engineering this

1067
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.280
pro this method i love that which makes
rendering and near impossible

1068
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.159
and also
ssds getting ssds that big are difficult

1069
01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:40.159
from the sounds of it it also seems like
she's not record she's not recording

1070
01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:44.000
