this video is brought to you by Manta
sleep hi this video has nothing to do

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.059
with Forrest Gump Forrest Gump is a 1994
inspirational drama starring Tom Hanks

3
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.559
and is one of his most famous roles that
is until he became famous for just being

4
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
Tom Hanks and zoomer's unwittingly made
the correct decision to maybe skip this

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.420
movie and it's safe to say that Forrest
Gump is not remembered fondly because I

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
can hardly say that it's Remembered at
all Forrest Gump is a simple movie

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
incredibly straightforward it's the
story of a man's life in America his

8
00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.340
story strings together a number of
significant events in American history

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.360
that he somehow managed to be a part of
there are no iconic shots that

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.500
particularly stand out other than him
sitting on a bench and running despite

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.899
this it won a whopping eight Academy
Awards at the 67th Oscars out of 13

12
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.320
nominations the record for most
nominations is shared between three

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
films at 14 by the way though it could
have had the 14 nominations if it had

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.300
pushed Robin Wright for best actress
though honestly that your best actress

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.500
was a tough category though really best
actresses usually a more interesting

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.479
category than best actor in my humble
opinion oh look at me I'm a man with

17
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
some feelings who's done something
horrible notably Forrest Gump basically

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.180
took a lot of awards that should have
gone to movies that even at the time

19
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
critics knew would stand the test of
time better according to every film

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
studies program or movie critic either
the Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
deserved those accolades Pulp Fiction
specifically holds a little bit more

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.799
attention in the modern media landscape
fitting perhaps uncomfortably into a

23
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.600
category of work such as Scarface Fight
Club and The Godfather for which a group

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.799
of CIS men based their ideas of the
modern masculine all the while being

25
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.040
blissfully ignorant to the fact that
each one of these examples serves to

26
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.340
undermine and subvert traditional
patriarchal values as they manifest in

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
society's different projections of men
also movies about organized crime of one

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
sort of another anyway Pulp Fiction's
most obvious claim to fame isn't really

29
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.579
for the reflection of intellectual
self-criticism that it has instead the

30
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.619
film is remembered for its Vibes that is
to say in an era of film which was

31
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.759
become coming more and more obsessed
with technique and formatting Pulp

32
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.200
Fiction sought to recreate a 70s
Nostalgia for serialized programming and

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.520
what we refer to as B cinema including
but not limited to black exploitation

34
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
films for which Tarantino holds great
reverence the goal of this aesthetic in

35
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.640
Tarantino's larger body of work is to
present lurid themes in provocative ways

36
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.959
it's safe to say that each one of
Tarantino's films can be described as a

37
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.860
Pastiche of different kinds of
exploitation films if not explicitly

38
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.180
being exploitation films themselves Pulp
Fiction in particular exemplifies these

39
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.780
sensibilities as this story is a
collection of vignettes about various

40
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.280
characters narrated out of chronology
hearkening to the early days of VHS home

41
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.700
rentals where you might watch a movie
series out of sequence depending upon

42
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
which tape was in stock on any
particular Friday night for instance I

43
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.840
watched the original 9 Friday the 13th
movies in the order of nine seven eight

44
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.400
one two six four three five now
Tarantino has said and done some

45
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180
questionable things in his career I'm
not making any excuses for that however

46
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.680
that can't diminish what he's brought to
the table as a filmmaker a screenwriter

47
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.400
who taught himself to direct because he
didn't have the budget for a director is

48
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.379
now regarded as one of American Cinema's
greats though from one film geek to

49
00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.400
another the man is so single-mindedly
obsessed with movies that it's hard not

50
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.879
to admire his earnesty from everything
Tarantino has said about his

51
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.379
Inspirations he has no objective to make
a parody of or correct any sensibilities

52
00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.459
of one of the b-movies that he loves so
much Tarantino genuinely has a fondness

53
00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.780
for this style of film and through his
work presents his audience with reasons

54
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.220
to share in that fondness the objective
is not to replace B cinema but to make

55
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.000
contributions to it the more you watch
Tarantino's Inspirations you realize

56
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.560
that there are very few visual elements
that are strictly original much of his

57
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.239
work that is considered iconic is
borrowed directly from directors that he

58
00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.519
would not hesitate to describe as
masters of The Craft but most film nerds

59
00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.580
probably have never even heard of he's
just very good at chopping it all up

60
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.060
into the right size pieces and throwing
it into a blender and in the process he

61
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.900
Champions many of the sensibilities
themes and Aesthetics of low rent 70s

62
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.880
films the critics of the day decried as
trash Tarantino's artistic message is

63
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.419
that they were never trash people just
weren't watching them the right way

64
00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.800
probably more so even than the Shawshank
Redemption which received none

65
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.120
of the 70 Academy Awards that it was
nominated for Pulp Fiction's losses to

66
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.919
Forest Gump are considered some of the
great Oscar snubs in history though it's

67
00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.300
clear to see why Forrest Gump's primary
objective was to lull its audience into

68
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.040
nostalgic ego death by trailing a plot
of feel-good emotional beats through an

69
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.300
unlikely interconnected through line of
America the content of the movie is

70
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.740
problematic to say the least starting
with but not limited to an able-bodied

71
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.919
creative team generating an empowerment
myth around a character with

72
00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.060
Developmental and physical disabilities
justifying and anyone Can Make It in

73
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.919
America mentality which Glides
dangerously into encouraging casual

74
00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.780
ableism we see any number of instances
of how it should be possible for the

75
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.320
physically disabled to just get over
their disabilities and become a football

76
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.520
star for someone to go through the
Vietnam War without any lingering trauma

77
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.820
and scolding those with it and the less
said about the book it's based on the

78
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.699
better you think Tarantino is
problematic the presentation of

79
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.020
nostalgia in this movie was so toxic at
Borders on American cultural propaganda

80
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.759
it's this weird unification of political
sensibilities conservative viewpoints

81
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.240
appreciate seeing the underdog do the
bootstraps thing especially without

82
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.960
complaining about how hard it is to be
disabled in America liberals like it

83
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.880
because it showcases America as a land
of freedom and opportunity where all the

84
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.139
heavy lifting has already been done so
they can say not in my backyard without

85
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.400
feeling racist ableist or classist and
for everyone watching it who was born in

86
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.940
the 70s or earlier they get the Rick
Dalton moment of spotting this fictional

87
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.240
person going through that thing they
lived through and that's why it got

88
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.220
Oscars AIDS is tragic when a straight
white woman gets it drug use is

89
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.240
sympathetic only when it's to cope with
childhood trauma and nobody needs

90
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.139
therapy for anything exploring the
realities of these situations and a

91
00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.340
seeming refusal to acknowledge how much
luck Forest has for being in the right

92
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.340
place at the right time with an amount
of emotional fortitude that is

93
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.539
unrealistic to expect of anyone is
something the film does not do fun fact

94
00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.660
I had no idea I hated Forrest Gump this
much before beginning to write this

95
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.440
script however Pulp Fiction and by
extension Tarantino's body of work also

96
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.300
relies heavily on Nostalgia though it's
a different kind of nostalgia whereas

97
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.840
Forrest Gump is specifically Guided by
an invisible hand through a series of

98
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.380
various events in American history
thereby tricking you into believing that

99
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.979
this story is quintessentially American
Tarantino's work confronts the audience

100
00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.699
with various cinematic Style from the
past even though Jackie Brown takes

101
00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.780
place in the 1990s when the movie was
made the sensibilities remind you of a

102
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.680
movie that happened in the 1970s and
even though Django Unchained takes place

103
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.080
in the 1800s the sensibilities remind
you of a western from the 1960s Kill

104
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.240
Bill vol 1 has sensibilities like a 70s
Hong Kong action movie while Volume 2

105
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.139
smashes together the sensibilities of
Kurosawa and Leone the nostalgic

106
00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.759
elements are in the meta narrative the
events in these movies are not familiar

107
00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:25.560
however the techniques framing devices
themes narrative Styles acting choices

108
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.599
Aesthetics and visual references what we
refer to as the sensibilities of

109
00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.699
artistic media are reminiscent of older
Styles oftentimes the kind of media we

110
00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.259
had grown up with and while this style
of B-movie never really received a claim

111
00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.039
while they were being made back in the
day creators who have the ability and

112
00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.180
ambition to recreate these styles are
celebrated again Tarantino is not

113
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.960
validating an existing artistic
sensibility he is Dem demonstrating that

114
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.560
these elements had always been valid
something to keep in mind for going into

115
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.000
this video which is as stated not about
Forrest Gump

116
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.340
but it's also not about Pulp Fiction so
let's talk about Barbie

117
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.620
thank you

118
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.959
this video is brought to you by Manta
sleep Manta makes the world's best sleep

119
00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:01.500
masks and sleep accessories a huge part
of their mission is taking a stand

120
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.120
against hustle culture and giving naps a
PR makeover and their Pro nap movement

121
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.200
the pro nap movement is about rejecting
counterproductive nap shaming corporate

122
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.860
BS and reclaiming what should have
always been yours in the first place

123
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.060
Your vitality one of the ways they're
doing this is by launching their line of

124
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.660
specialized sleep masks these aren't
just flimsy pieces of fabric you throw

125
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.680
over your eyes at bedtime these have
cushioned infinitely adjustable eye cups

126
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.880
to fit any face you can get a
traditional sleep mask a mask designed

127
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.860
for cooling one that produces steam a
weighted mask a silk masks with

128
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.300
unmatched ventilation and even one with
built-in speakers as a huge fan of ASMR

129
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.800
that's my favorite it has razor thin
headphones and 20 hours of battery life

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.100
the kind of Beautyrest only Barbie could
dream of

133
00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:05.700
foreign
awaited movie about the titular line of

134
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.899
dolls by Mattel which have been a staple
of American business since 1959. it

135
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:12.600
seemed for some time that this Barbie
movie would remain a development hell

136
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.620
due to the divisive nature of a toy
which is often criticized for its

137
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.940
portrayal of women and due to the
divisive nature of Amy Schumer who was

138
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.560
originally poised to star before the
creative team switched to Margot Robbie

139
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.480
and Greta Gerwig we almost got a very
different movie thank sea fillers love

140
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.440
them for some reason this movie got very
hype very quickly even before the review

141
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.459
embargo was lifted critics who saw early
screenings were already speculating

142
00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:41.519
about Academy Awards attention and
likewise for two weeks following the

143
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.480
release it was difficult to find empty
seats at any time of day some who would

144
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.320
live through the 70s compared this to
the release of Star Wars Barbie earns

145
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.680
that comparison the thing about Barbie
that strikes me as the most remarkable

146
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:59.160
is what was just under discussion here
its sensibilities to the Gaze there is a

147
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.060
reason we first flock towards Barbie
memes from the teaser trailer which was

148
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.079
a parody of 2001 A Space Odyssey and
then participated in the barberheimer

149
00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:10.500
discourse as it became apparent that
Barbie was going to be more than counter

150
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.160
programming for Christopher Nolan's
Oppenheimer it was direct competition

151
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.480
from the very first leaks of Barbie's
Cowboy outfit spotted in Venice Beach to

152
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.640
the Absurd reference to 2001 this movie
felt familiar to us granted it's one

153
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.060
thing to throw out camp sensibilities in
a teaser trailer but the entire movie

154
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.740
really was this campy which taking the
film itself out of consideration it

155
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.160
should not be the case that it can't be
rump between LA and Barbie land should

156
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.579
be taken as seriously as it has been
both for Technical and creative early

157
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:43.440
Awards contention all the while being a
cultural Sensation that caused a pink

158
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.060
shortage around the world Camp is
associated with movies like Barbarella

159
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.200
Elvira or Batman and Robin Camp is what
happens when you fail so hard at making

160
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.760
serious drama that you create Mommy
Dearest or show Girls Camp is for silly

161
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.560
theater campus for the queers Camp isn't
supposed to be for proper prestigious

162
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.300
Cinema Camp isn't supposed to go
mainstream Studio Executives couldn't

163
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.839
tell the difference between Death
Becomes Her and There's Something About

164
00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:14.339
Mary well this is the problem with Camp
as an artistic sensibility sensibilities

165
00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:18.920
are called that because they're not a
proper genre and they're largely

166
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.779
unqualifiable outside of direct examples
like B-movie Aesthetics Camp is largely

167
00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.279
dependent on context and the ability to
establish context where this is not only

168
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:32.399
possible
but where this is the norm Death Becomes

169
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.880
Her leaves no question that any single
aspect of the narrative is outside the

170
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.959
norm whatsoever from beginning to end it
is the world that is Camp and the

171
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:44.339
characters are elevated to exist within
it the context is the comedy the setting

172
00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:48.720
needs to do some heavy lifting to
establish this that way by the time the

173
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.660
main characters decide they need to
kidnap their ex-husband so he can

174
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.380
continue doing their makeup to make them
look alive they're already participating

175
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.940
in this heightened campy World meanwhile
There's Something About Mary is rooted

176
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.959
almost entirely within the context of
the real world There's Something About

177
00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:07.740
Mary means that this particular Mary
though more specifically the events

178
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.420
surrounding her are outside the realm of
normal but to discuss a distance from

179
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.260
reality the audience needs to maintain
their view of reality elevated

180
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.740
performances are standouts mainly
because Ben Stiller's character the

181
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.579
audience's cipher is depicted as just a
normal guy trying to get the girl again

182
00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:26.880
this is a world where according to the
sensibilities of the movie people should

183
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.720
be acting normal and there is a tension
drawn to people who are elevate rated

184
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.139
the elevated characters are framed as
Outsiders to Conventional real world

185
00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:39.420
sensibilities Camp C akes to shift the
social conventions that we take for

186
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.899
granted something like shaking someone's
hand in a job interview is a social

187
00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:47.579
construct and is a learned behavior
within the parameters of euro-american

188
00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:51.240
etiquette this is not to be confused
with though within the hegemony it

189
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.660
almost always is a more Universal
element of human nature for which

190
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.160
instinctively hugging people you care
about is more typical thus to the people

191
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.240
who do not exist within the framework of
euro-american cultural imperialism a

192
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.959
handshake is a gesture that doesn't mean
anything at all conventions around

193
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:10.920
gender sexuality etiquette and formality
can be subverted because they only exist

194
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.000
insofar as we acknowledge them we know
this because

195
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.680
though gender exists in every
pre-colonial culture the number of

196
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.139
genders and social roles of each gender
can differ vastly likewise in Camp the

197
00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:29.459
media in question can construct its own
independent rules about how one should

198
00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:34.320
act for instance Faye dunaway's Joan
Crawford becomes the gold standard for

199
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.519
how people are expected to behave in
this world of Mommy Dearest

200
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:42.120
unfortunately it's not an exact science
dunaway's acting choices were so

201
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.079
outrageous that it eclipses everything
else on screen without adequate framing

202
00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:50.279
devices namely another character to act
as her foil or stronger direction to

203
00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:53.040
properly frame this performance the
audience can take it for granted that

204
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.519
her degree of intensity is just how
people are supposed to act in this world

205
00:14:56.519 --> 00:15:00.720
she is the lead character after all and
so all performances that do not meet her

206
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.440
by comparison are the Absurd ones
granted it really helps the Joan

207
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.579
Crawford herself was a very elevated
person in a very elevated world it's

208
00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.579
easy to make Camp about show business
because the day-to-day reality of

209
00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:14.459
existing in this world is outrageous
without a framing device to

210
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:20.279
contextualize how Faye Dunaway fits into
reality as a human person she becomes a

211
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.940
caricature and a scene which is not
fictitious for people who have lived

212
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.199
through abusive parents can become
comedic to people who haven't simply

213
00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:31.440
because the media does not equip the
audience to understand how this

214
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.980
particular human interaction fits into
the context of real life and this

215
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:41.220
relationship dichotomy between real and
hypothetical is particularly important

216
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.820
Barbie

217
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.579
in this work of fiction there are at
least two parallel worlds there is our

218
00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:57.300
world and then there is Barbie land
Barbie land's existence is under

219
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.600
explained but through context and
framing we can gather how they are

220
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.560
connected Barbie land is the Hub of
collective consciousness of people

221
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.519
actively partaking in Barbie the way
people in the real world choose to

222
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:12.480
engage with the idea of Barbie
influences events in Barbie land and the

223
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.800
variations of Barbie which are
theoretically infinite the politics

224
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.339
Logistics and laws of physics in Barbie
land are errantly dismissed in a way

225
00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:24.180
that is communicated directly and
indirectly to the audience what are the

226
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.380
Ken's day
I don't know the rules of the real world

227
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.920
are shifted on a fundamental level
creating an alternate universe that can

228
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.519
be constructed on a camp platform
alternate universes are an excellent

229
00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:39.240
framing device for camp this is half the
reason why show business is so Rife with

230
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.320
Camp sensibilities by all accounts
getting into American show business is a

231
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.459
whole different spectrum of reality
granted if you wanted to pick a parallel

232
00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:51.720
world to American politics but
inexcusably replace all male stereotypes

233
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.220
with women Camp is one tool that you can
lean on to justify the mechanics of that

234
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.699
world and given that camp has a cultural
background in subverting gender to

235
00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:03.180
comedic effect it's a good match and
furthermore when you're making a movie

236
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.600
about a line of dolls existing in
another world where dolls typify the

237
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.020
boundaries of Womanhood they are meant
to represent in a plotted discourse

238
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.540
about the intersection of woman and the
idea of women why not just

239
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.620
Go the whole way the collection of
Barbies in this place is governed by the

240
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.939
real world Collective consciousness of
the idea of Barbie and how people play

241
00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:28.199
with Barbie casting Margot Robbie as
stereotypical Barbie is an act of

242
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:34.260
casting so inspired it seems to be the
only valid choice but Barbies are also

243
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.919
doctors politicians reporters authors
lawyers astronauts and even construction

244
00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:41.400
workers
instruction site we need that good

245
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.179
feminine energy any idea that someone
playing with Barbie has about Barbie

246
00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:49.559
will present itself in Barbie land
according to the driving philosophy of

247
00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:54.480
Barbie women can be and are anything
this is just a little bit more literal

248
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.280
in Barbie land but this works for good
and bad things as presented by the

249
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.679
driving plot of the movie look at your
upper thigh

250
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.620
it's not cellulite that's going to
spread everywhere and then you're going

251
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.400
to start getting sad and Wishy
complicated no

252
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.419
this kind of ubiquitous Barbie
experience facilitates and justifies how

253
00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:19.020
Barbies would have access to this range
of knowledge and experience the audience

254
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.980
doesn't need to question it because
Barbie land isn't the real world there

255
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.480
is no reason not to take it for granted
just like in the real world we seem to

256
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.960
just take it for granted that women earn
70 cents on the dollar for every dollar

257
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.919
a man makes Camp is the best asset the
film has for engaging in academic

258
00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:39.900
discourse which also cues the audience
in to read deeper into the subtext Camp

259
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.559
as a phenomenon has been predominantly
associated with Notions of extravagance

260
00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:49.020
irony and theatricality the concept of
Camp media is deeply rooted in gendered

261
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.460
perceptions and has over time come to be
associated with a predominantly feminine

262
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.600
sensibility which is why I would argue
many critics look down upon it but with

263
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.820
Barbie camp instead of functioning as a
sensibility functions rather as the very

264
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.020
framing device for Barbie land so there
is license to afford the plot some

265
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.100
silliness as well as intellectualism
money is not speech and corporations

266
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.120
have have no free speech rights to begin
with so any claim on their part to be

267
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.960
exercising or right is just their
attempt to turn our democracy into a

268
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.160
plutocracy if I wasn't severely injured
I would beat you off right now Ken if

269
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.860
I'll be chop with you any day cat
nobody's going to beat anyone off

270
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:31.140
neither of those two performances seem
out of place here Barbie is a toy which

271
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.640
means that naturally frivolity is going
to be a component of how people engage

272
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.380
with this idea however as Barbie is an
adult featured doll directed at allowing

273
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.179
girls to develop expectations about
adulthood outside of motherhood Barbie

274
00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:49.380
land is naturally going to reflect the
use of this toy to project those

275
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.299
fantasies a hush balls over the general
assembly as Stacy approaches the podium

276
00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:58.679
to deliver what will no doubt be a
stirring and memorable address

277
00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:04.260
do you guys everything about dying
oh this is where Barbie gets interesting

278
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.280
from a literary standpoint because while
it may just seem to use Camp

279
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.020
sensibilities it also presents a
possible evolution of Camp through the

280
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.880
use of Camp to present the audience with
unfiltered gender Theory at which point

281
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.620
Camp is less of an aesthetic and more of
a literary device whereas before Camp

282
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.700
relied on literary devices in order to
present itself defamiliarization the

283
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.799
carnivalesque irony maximalism Etc here
Camp itself is the vessel being used to

284
00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:36.000
present what amounts to gender Theory
101 which isn't an insult by any means

285
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
it's rare that any kind of gender
discourse makes it into a movie these

286
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.780
days when giving a woman a sword is the
least amount of effort it takes to evoke

287
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.679
a collection of basement dwellers to
rise up and act so obnoxiously that the

288
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:51.240
world thinks that there's just so many
of them when there's like eight Kemp

289
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.780
allows Barbie to pass off these academic
elements as just

290
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.880
part of the absurdist comedy everything
exists to expand and Elevate the

291
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.780
presence of men
just because this is framed as a joke

292
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.400
and it is comedic
shouldn't suggest it's not true this may

293
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.480
very well be quoting or paraphrasing a
textbook comedy here is just an angle

294
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.919
about how this information is presented
if my life wasn't funny

295
00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:23.580
it would just be true
and that is completely unacceptable this

296
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.120
isn't entirely unique to the Barbie
movie cartoons will often engage with

297
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.080
real world phenomena in comedic ways
what makes Barbie Stand Out is the

298
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.159
dichotomy between the real world and
Barbie land the transit between the two

299
00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:38.820
places in Barbie land Camp really can
only function in a theoretical way

300
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.500
offering commentary about Concepts but
no real application the structure of the

301
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.679
Barbie movie allows for the camp
sensibility to not only pass into the

302
00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:50.520
real world but afford a framing device
for using Camp to directly confront

303
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.900
elements of our reality in a way that
would not have been possible in the

304
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.700
campy at theoretical Barbie land

305
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.600
the shift in atmosphere brings Camp
sensibilities to the real world

306
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.740
viscerally it makes sense for Barbie and
Ken to deconstruct the real world in a

307
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.159
way that aligns with the direct
defamiliarized sensibilities that exist

308
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:18.539
in Barbie land it's like saying the
quiet part loud and there's no undertone

309
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:22.020
of violence mine very much has an
undertone of violence through Barbie and

310
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.440
Ken's existence in a subverted reality
we see their expectations of the real

311
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.240
world shift dramatically where once it
was taken for granted the Kens as men

312
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.380
were designated second-class citizens he
is confronted with a different reality

313
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.740
rather than Camp challenging the
sensibilities of reality as we are

314
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.299
accustomed to reality is challenging the
sensibilities of Camp which through the

315
00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:45.720
First Act the audience has been
conditioned to take for granted suddenly

316
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.200
there's water coming out of that glass
I'm not used to that having anything in

317
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.559
it Camp has a role in being able to
afford these characters insight into the

318
00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:56.280
real world and by proxy the audience
that one cannot garnish from existing

319
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.299
within it and taking it for granted
Barbie land being another world entirely

320
00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:04.679
sets a very literal framing device not
only for camp but a commentary on Camp

321
00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:09.000
where Barbie land is a vessel for camp
and the real world is literally

322
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.679
desaturated Camp sensibilities look
acceptable in a camp environment though

323
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:17.039
in a realistic environment they stick
out bearing in mind that this is an

324
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:20.400
absurdist comedy and much of the
delivery exists within that style of

325
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.679
humor and I would just like to inform
you I do not have a vagina

326
00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:29.640
and he does not have a penis in the real
world there is no attempt to interject

327
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.179
Camp sensibilities into the plot human
characters largely act in accordance

328
00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:36.600
with the conventional etiquette of our
world with the exception of the Mattel

329
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.320
headquarters provided Mattel's proximity
to Barbie land many of the same

330
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.820
mechanics from there also seem to have
permeated the workplace they after all

331
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.080
owe their success to selling molded
plastic which vaguely resembles a human

332
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.480
woman and acts as a vessel for the idea
of a woman Will Ferrell's Mattel CEO is

333
00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.380
also not necessarily a CEO but befits
the most idealized idea of a CEO you

334
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.340
think I spent my entire life in
boardroom because of a bottom line no I

335
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.000
got into this business because of little
girls and their dreams and the least

336
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.659
creepy way possible while stereotypical
Barbie threw the growth and development

337
00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:16.919
of her personhood becomes disillusioned
with her perfect plastic life and opts

338
00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:20.700
for a wider range of lived experiences
it seems like Will Ferrell's character

339
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:26.820
is much more at home in the absurdism of
Barbie land Mr Mattel at least relax

340
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.539
call me mother
no thank you and honestly observing how

341
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:33.960
people pass between the real world and
Barbie land is in and of itself worthy

342
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.080
of commentary regarding the effect of
the ideas of the real world versus the

343
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.039
inability of the real world of permeate
ideas real world sensibilities when they

344
00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:46.860
enter the realm of camp
become Camp okay kids it's time to run

345
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.340
out and get the new depression Barbie
she wears sweatpants all day and night

346
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.520
and this applies to the patriarchy thank
God this movie finally talks about

347
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.720
masculine camp for so long everyone
always Associated camp with femininity

348
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.240
and feminine Expressions but we now have
a visceral example of how easily Camp

349
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.200
sensibility can be retooled to apply to
masculine spaces too and we're not even

350
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.140
going to talk about professional
wrestling because that's a that's a

351
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.820
whole other video there's a whole other
video about that

352
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.659
yeah it's coming the exact mechanics of
how a single can applied patriarchal

353
00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:21.780
values to an entire world are not as
important this is a world constructed on

354
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:27.059
play-like logic and concept why were the
Barbies corrupted well Camp as a device

355
00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:31.799
allows for a focus on theme and message
how it happened is significantly less

356
00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:35.760
important than why it happened the short
answer is that Barbie land has already

357
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.299
abundantly established itself as not
holding itself to the same logical

358
00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:43.440
standard as our world we don't need to
be able to rationalize what's happening

359
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.460
through the Ken's takeover of Barbie
land we see a feminine perspective on

360
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.960
what it's like to exist within
exclusively masculine sensibilities and

361
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.480
how if left unchecked a group of men can
quickly descend into that same kind of

362
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.659
absurdism that we saw in the opening
section of the movie The sensibilities

363
00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:06.600
remain the same but the aesthetic
completely changes Sublime the framing

364
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.640
is antagonistic Barbie land functions on
a particular status quo such as our

365
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.419
world and when the status quo is upset
in our world there are significant

366
00:26:15.419 --> 00:26:19.919
powers that seek to divide and conquer
to re-establish that the presentation of

367
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:24.360
these new mask camps sensibilities are
almost identical to the earlier

368
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.600
sensibilities we have earlier and it's
girls night

369
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.799
hurry up the president's here I am
you're welcome and then come on in I'll

370
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:39.539
play the guitar at you we observed the
first scene as camp

371
00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:43.620
and yet I think I can say declaratively
that we see the second one as cringe I

372
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.980
feel as if the presentation and context
for these deliveries are fairly similar

373
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.760
and same with all the Ken's chaotic
Ridiculousness from excessive veneration

374
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.600
of the select group of highlighted films
and strategies for picking up girls the

375
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.940
general aesthetic seems to be much more
unappealing simply because

376
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.200
due to the range of expression afforded
to Men by patriarchal values there is a

377
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.860
greater freedom to push these
sensibilities into the real world the

378
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.360
reason we see this as cringe whereas the
Dreamhouse aesthetic was Camp is because

379
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.520
we are confronted with kendam
sensibilities so often there is nothing

380
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.140
really to de-familiarize we live in
Kingdom already it's just as heightened

381
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.640
as Barbie land but we in the real world
have already acclimated to it you can't

382
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.059
tell me that the sensibility is
expressed in movies like die hard Rambo

383
00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:34.799
The Expendables The Fast and Furious
aren't drawing from the same incredibly

384
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:39.900
heightened Joan crawford-esque pool of
themes as Showgirls and yet there is a

385
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.799
refusal to mark them as Camp because I
would argue we simply take this boys

386
00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:48.240
will be boys mentality about boy things
and boy Aesthetics as a cultural for

387
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.460
granted fast X will never be considered
Camp except by those of appropriately

388
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.900
refined taste because we exist in a
world where that is the for granted

389
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.860
element of gender expression and that
isn't to say that it's bad for those who

390
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.799
haven't been paying attention to this
channel for the last three years

391
00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:09.179
I love campy things the problem becomes
when we hold that as the standard for

392
00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:13.200
gendered media expectations for a young
boy growing up saturated in that media

393
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.860
what kind of man is that going to
generate as opposed to women whose

394
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.240
gender sensibilities when elevated to
those Heights are considered to be

395
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.679
deviations from the norm at which point
we invent the term Camp to describe

396
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:30.480
those sensibilities in a way the Fast
and the Furious Shenanigans are just a

397
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.600
normal action movie Megan is just camp
and here we find an underlying theme

398
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.960
probably one of the core themes of
Barbie that the real fantasy of Barbie

399
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.000
land was that it existed as a space
where women did not need to justify

400
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.620
their Womanhood and of course this also
shouldn't suggest that the patriarchy

401
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.880
doesn't also put this Spotlight on men
as well as evidenced by the countless

402
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.940
generations of men who do terrible
things in order to live up to the

403
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.260
example of a perceived father figure who
also sought The elusive pride of his

404
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.740
father figure but it's not Daddy Issues
if you're a man society just holds it up

405
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.260
up his boys being boys though what many
of us who chronically exist in gender

406
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.779
discourse may not understand is that
these concepts are almost entirely

407
00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:20.399
unexplored by those outside of queerness
and femininity and now I just gave each

408
00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:23.460
of you of a certain age an uncomfortable
flashback to that time you were drinking

409
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.659
with your old friends from high school
who are now straight married wherein one

410
00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:31.620
of their spouses proceeds to lay out
this whole finger-wagging discourse

411
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.100
about gender and they're not really
saying anything wrong but the tone of

412
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.840
voice and the authority of the wagging
finger seems to indicate that this is a

413
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.580
grand Treatise that only the most
critical of thinkers have discerned

414
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.600
meanwhile this is the kind of stuff that
you live with day in and day out so it's

415
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.260
not really as groundbreaking as your
friend's spouse seems to think it is but

416
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.080
they don't really understand this when
you try to explain it to them because

417
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.159
they live in a Suburban bubble where
they use homemaking to recuse themselves

418
00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:04.200
from participating in gender discourse
but what pisses you off is that they

419
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.059
still feel entitled to their two bits in
spite of the recusal Barbie's

420
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:12.299
lighthearted approach to projecting
these elements of gender Theory to that

421
00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:16.799
end function to great effect by
communicating these ideas to that

422
00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:21.779
audience and this was only possible
through its use of Camp sensibilities to

423
00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:26.460
present them which as I said is a
remarkable and creative use for camp in

424
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.659
a way that has not really been widely
received by the public at large before

425
00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:34.380
especially not as critically
successfully as this movie has been but

426
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.740
that raises some questions about how the
future of camp in cinema will play out

427
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.220
whether like through Pulp Fiction there
will be a sudden retrospective

428
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.360
veneration of Camp as there was for the
exploitation films or if it will just be

429
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.100
accepted as an outlier
which prompts us to observe how Camp is

430
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.380
manifesting in other examples today

431
00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:03.600
Camp has become an increasingly
prominent form of comedic delivery in

432
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.159
the prior few years and very likely due
to covet 19. when larger Studios head to

433
00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:12.419
postpone Productions and releases of new
content smaller Studios were able to

434
00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:16.140
adapt to regulations producing media
which required smaller casts and Crews

435
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.799
I've already spoken about everything
everywhere all at once which though I

436
00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:24.720
hadn't mentioned it does lean heavily
into Camp also to its benefit is one of

437
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.200
the rare Blockbuster examples of a
camp-oriented movie for which a starring

438
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.220
role is a queer character Camp is used
as a delivery device to justify a

439
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.000
marriage of outrageous concepts with
deeply resonant themes also noteworthy

440
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.480
for earning an Oscar for horror icon
Jamie Lee Curtis whose wheelhouse of

441
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.140
slasher movies should have been a black
mark against her that was only earlier

442
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.500
this year

443
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.980
whether by chance or if the film's
immediate success hearkened an overnight

444
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.860
shift in cultural values spurring
editors and directors to nudge

445
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.120
in-development projects towards this
kind of camp we have seen in the year

446
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.419
and a half since everything everywhere
all at once its release a marked

447
00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:07.980
injection of these sensibilities into
acclaimed Cinema among the most high

448
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.679
profile examples is polarizing divisive
writer and director Ryan Johnson's Glass

449
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:18.539
Onion starring Daniel Craig and Janelle
Monae Monet who attempted to outheard

450
00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:22.080
their self as pansexual with a song
about how great vaginas were while

451
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.700
wearing high fashion vulva trousers was
misconstrued as making a generalized

452
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.539
girl power Anthem to which she had to
make a public statement clarifying that

453
00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:34.679
no it was gay [ __ ] and that was all
Steven Tyler can make a song by the same

454
00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:39.360
name and everybody gets it but when
Janelle Monae does it it's all Vagina

455
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.120
Monologues girl how much sexuality do we
have to rub in your face to be

456
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.659
acknowledged exactly in Glass Onion a
sequel to knives out a murder mystery

457
00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:49.500
which makes it abundantly clear who the
murderer is but does its best to

Gaslight you in doubting yourself
Janelle Monae plays Andy brand she is a

Amazon she was zucked out of the company

by her ex-friend and business partner
miles Braun Ron is very closely based on

462
00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:10.380
and when Andy wounds his ego by blocking
miles's attempt to invest in a highly

463
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.740

that anything new means the future of

everything he convinces their friend
group to help cheat Andy out of her

465
00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:21.059
shares of alpha when Andy teases that
she found a pivotal piece of evidence

466
00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:25.559
that will not only prove that Alpha was
her intellectual property but will

467
00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:29.039
remove miles from the company and
destroy the reputation of her suddenly

468
00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:34.200
no longer best friends miles murders her
Monet also plays Andy's twin sister

469
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.039
Helen an Alabama Elementary School
teacher with nobody else in the cast

470
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:42.360
except for the killer aware that Andy is
dead Helen reaches out to gentleman

471
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.500
sleuth Benoit blah and he hatches a plan
to figure out which one of the friend

472
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.480
group killed Andy by making everyone
think that Helen is Andy these movies

473
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.840
are less about keeping you on the edge
of your seat to guess who done it and

474
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.620
more about showing you a myriad of
reasons about why rich people are just

475
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.760
the worst the plot itself could be
passed for drama we have a white man

476
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.059
murdering a black woman to not only
steal her success but also her Legacy

477
00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:09.839
and to get away with it scot-free which
is tragic though aside from the dark

478
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:13.980
plot there's this
ugly betty-esque absurdity hiding behind

479
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.119
bushes solving a grandchild dramatic
staged murder chronic name dropping of

480
00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:22.619
cultural references and of course Benoit
blah in general specific plot points

481
00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:26.399
such as the twin swap feel perfectly at
home with camp but there are other

482
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:29.520
instances a character being murdered on
an island and the Coast Guard being

483
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.060
unable to come because miles insists on
a dock that's more of an art piece than

484
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.020
something useful and therefore is only
functional at low tide generating a

485
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.080
character you hate so much that you
really don't mind watching the

486
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.099
destruction of the Mona Lisa just to get
at them Benoit blah who at this point is

487
00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:49.320
a confirmed gay man spends about five
minutes reading elot I mean miles Brawn

488
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.639
miles Brawn miles Brawn for Filth again
these movies are more about how terrible

489
00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:57.599
rich people are and likewise they seem
to paint people like miles Braun as

490
00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:02.599
possessing so much wealth that they have
the option of literally and figuratively

491
00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:06.180
separating themselves from reality and
if you have the kind of wealth that

492
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.359
extends in into the billions
constructing the kind of Grecian Island

493
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:12.540
Paradise home that would bankrupt most
Nations

494
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.260
is just a drop in the bucket at which
point it becomes normal to spend the

495
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.560
kind of Fortune that would be otherwise
needed to eradicate homelessness in a

496
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.859
reasonably large city to install a giant
glass Monument on the top floor of your

497
00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:26.400
Island Home complete with a rotating
display case that contains a custom

498
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.540
designed car it becomes normal to
contract Jillian flinton to craft a

499
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.599
convoluted fictional murder mystery in
order to entertain a handful of friends

500
00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:37.320
for the weekend it becomes normal to
hide an invitation in a multi-layer

501
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.400
puzzle box because all the other rich
people in this movie take it for granted

502
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.900
that this is normal and thus our POV
character becomes highlighted as the

503
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:51.619
abnormal one because she does not have
the time or patience for this [ __ ]

504
00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:56.940
however the concern for me is that well
if Camp is going mainstream what does

505
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.880
that mean for the kind of comedy and
heightened drama we have been

506
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.260
associating with Cam for years as far as
murder mysteries go both clue and Glass

507
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.700
Onion May both be camp but clue seems to
lean into camp in a bit more of a

508
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.740
fundamental way than Glass Onion does a
concern I would have is that more

509
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.660
prestigious creators are taking the
wacky Whimsical absurdism of camp and

510
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.180
desaturating it to make it more
palatable and align with the more

511
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.660
emotional drama of good character
construction rather than just Flames

512
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.940
flame Flames flames
on the side of my face because as much

513
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.300
as I like seeing Camp become elevated to
valid use as a filmmaking tool for

514
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.960
helping audiences identify with
characters in outrageous situations I

515
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.500
don't want to see movies like clue get
priced out because they can't do camp

516
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.119
with a special effects budget well
part of the wonders of being alive today

517
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.420
means that you can take a relatively
small budget and get a reasonably

518
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.220
convincing CGI bear who is ripped on
cocaine to great effect

519
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.720
do you find yourself lethargic are you
unwilling to engage in society at large

520
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.339
do you have difficulty finding enjoyment
in things you used to love are you

521
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:06.000
struggling to find ways to enjoy a story
that spends most of his time trying to

522
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.619
overbuild a world in the expectation it
will be paid off in sequels do you

523
00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:14.640
expect all movies to be the same and
become afraid when they have different

524
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.740
pacing or plot beats that feel strange
and unfamiliar you may be suffering from

525
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:24.660
too many [ __ ] Marvel movies people
who suffer from too many Marvel movies

526
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.500
will speculate endlessly with their
friends about possible spin-off ideas

527
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.640
for television programs but won't tell
them that they're exhausted from having

528
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.839
to do hours of binging and research to
understand what's going on at any given

529
00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:40.320
episode because they just don't know
what else keeps the Friendship alive if

530
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.560
exposed to too many [ __ ] Marvel
movies at a young age you may even

531
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.800
reject well-made films because they
don't have the Staples of Marvel movies

532
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.900
or you may gauge the quality of Cinema
based on arbitrary Marvel values such as

533
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:57.599
the suit up sequence but there is a
solution ask your doctor about taking a

534
00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:00.720
break from morph movies side effects may
include a sudden realization of how the

535
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.700
Marvel formula has permitted all movies
being made in the last 10 years

536
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.680
disappointment movies that you don't
need to speculate about in order to

537
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.900
enjoy a lack of dopamine from ignoring
Marvel movie announcements a drastic

538
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.420
increase of unrealistic expectations for
filmmakers judging a movie entirely

539
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.400
based on the quality of CGI and
automatic consumption that anything that

540
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.440
is popular is automatically a poor
quality potterheads are especially at

541
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.359
risk if you find yourself revisiting
Harry Potter contact your doctor

542
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.720
immediately it's time to start taking a
break from Marvel movies because there's

543
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.320
more to life

544
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.940
all right
foreign

545
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.460
side effect to The Fall of the House of
feige is that movie theaters actually

546
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.900
have screens for things other than CGI
compositing disaster spandex soap operas

547
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.619
now for which a decrease in Creative
oversight results in a sprawling

548
00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:45.180
cinematic Empire owing its Twilight
years to a collective of fans who have

549
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.320
been gaslit into believing that the
Marvel Cinematic formula is the only

550
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.099
possible let alone valid method of
presenting a film for which audiences

551
00:38:53.099 --> 00:38:57.060
only remaining primary draw to these
movies isn't to enjoy these stories but

552
00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.240
to be able to participate in online
speculation about who may or may not be

553
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.740
Mephisto and I do mean that theaters
actually have screens for smaller movies

554
00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.780
now a read of some people who in rural
American communities could not see

555
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:14.520
everything everywhere all at once when
it came out because Spider-Man no way

556
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.859
home was still holding all the screens
at smaller theaters three months after

557
00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:23.940
its release but with Marvel movie news
chilling the crap out for a little bit

558
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.420
not to mention this strikes we're
getting exposure to the kind of movie

559
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:33.300
news that we haven't seen since
before Obama suddenly you don't need to

560
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.839
make a CGI spectacle trailer to pull
attention at Hall age at Comic-Con

561
00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:40.380
smaller movies from smaller Studios can
attract audiences through more

562
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.800
traditional methods without getting
drowned out by A Chorus of Marvel movies

563
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.280
and movies trying to be Marvel movies
which is great for things like

564
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.339
everything everywhere all at once and
Barbie but also good for movies that

565
00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:53.760
don't need to be highly stylized and
have the backing of wealthy sponsors in

566
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.200
Marvel's Russo refugees in the last two
years I've seen a public interest in

567
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.700
Camp that has been growing cocaine bear
Megan and the blackening am I allowed to

568
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.460
talk about the blackening have found
audiences that would not have been

569
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.540
afforded to them under the reign of
Marvel the blackening in particular I'm

570
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.359
going to talk about the blackening I
found to be an amazing archetypal

571
00:40:12.359 --> 00:40:15.839
example of how Camp can be used to join
an absurdist commentary of current

572
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:19.200
social trends namely being black in
America within Blackness and within the

573
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.980
white hegemony as well as present very
real moments as I said earlier Camp

574
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.579
seems to be an excellent tool for
creators to distinguish what is real and

575
00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:30.720
what is fantasy in a way where neither
disrupts the tone but then again in

576
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.560
spite of my my initial framing around
Barbie perhaps suddenly validating camp

577
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.220
that may have been misleading Barbie
seems to be a very high profile instance

578
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.900
of brazen Camp being accepted by a mass
audience and critics alike because for

579
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.220
all we associate camp with being
frivolous or lesser than other serious

580
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.599
sensibilities all of the aforementioned
creators Greta Gerwig the Daniels and

581
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:55.619
Ryan Johnson are oscar-winning and
oscar-nominated and there are other

582
00:40:55.619 --> 00:41:00.420
acclaimed directors who lean heavily
into Camp as well bosslerman takawatiti

583
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.099
Wes Anderson and jorgos lanthamos are
all building prestigious careers of the

584
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:09.480
kind of humor and absurdism that had
Spice World panned by critics though

585
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.099
venerated as a legend of Camp by critics
today on one level this may be

586
00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:18.359
surprising however a closer examination
of cinematic history shows that this

587
00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:23.099
style of theatricalism was once the
status quo for drama and comedy alike

588
00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:26.940
there are arguments to be made for
limitations of what camp can be for many

589
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.680
within the queer Community they may say
the camp can only be in regard to things

590
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.480
about or directed at queer people that
there is an unspoken Democratic order

591
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.980
within the community that nominates
content to be held up as camp that only

592
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.040
a queer Collective of lived-in
sensibilities can designate Camp

593
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:48.180
alternatively there are creatives who
would reject having a camp label on

594
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.420
their content due to the queer
association with camp Camp was not a

595
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.420
direct intentional component of who's
Afraid of Virginia wool for All About

596
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.560
Eve films with legendary impact and
accolades the thing about camp that sets

597
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.500
it apart from other sensibilities and
ultimately

598
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.440
why those of taste are drawn to it
is that it's an autores device well

599
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.740
granted it is possible to accidentally
step into Camp through a creative team's

600
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.460
misalignment of sensibilities however
it's much more difficult to generate

601
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.500
camp on purpose in order to create camp
with intent a very steady hand is

602
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.280
required of the creative team it can't
be artificially replicated by a

603
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.300
committee or a focus group a boardroom
of Executives can't create camp with a

604
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.099
checklist because as I mentioned of
sensibilities it is found in the

605
00:42:31.099 --> 00:42:36.359
non-quantifiable elements of Framing and
delivery go too far and you make

606
00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:39.960
something cringy there's a reason the
gays don't remember the live-action

607
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.640
Mario movie not going far enough is just
boring Die Another Day nearly killed the

608
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.839
bond franchise to know where the perfect
balance is which some creators may

609
00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:54.660
accidentally step into you need to exist
within Camp and genuinely enjoy Camp to

610
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.339
understand it Barbie was able to be made
the way that it was because Greta Gerwig

611
00:42:59.339 --> 00:43:03.540
did not have a whole lot of executive
oversight from Warner Brothers the so

612
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:08.099
she and other creators had an
opportunity to create they understood

613
00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:12.599
camp in a way that many if not all
Executives would not after all the

614
00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:16.740
Barbie movie was made while Executives
at Warner Discovery were desperately

615
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.700
trying to sort out a merger and dealing
with a studio that can't seem to hold on

616
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.720
to cash in spite of owning DC Harry
Potter Lord of the Rings Lego The Matrix

617
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.900
the Looney Tunes Batman Mortal Kombat
and The Conjuring when Camp is made

618
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.280
deliberately it is made by creatives
without executive oversight and as proof

619
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.140
that Executives have no idea what camp
is

620
00:43:36.359 --> 00:43:41.579
cats
movies are not reality they're an

621
00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:47.040
artistic version of reality
and for this reason Camp is perhaps a

622
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.180
more natural state of being
it recognizes the falseness of the real

623
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.099
world and how even the term reality is
fraudulent there is no universal truth

624
00:43:56.099 --> 00:44:00.420
no matter how those of privilege like to
project their version of the truth as

625
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.160
universal
but we know us Outsiders we know that

626
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.660
truth is subjective we know that our
truth is not the truth of those who have

627
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.619
oppressed us
so we are drawn to this artistic vessel

628
00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:18.359
that makes a mockery out of truth and
the social conventions we have been

629
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:22.319
rejected from
many of us may as well have been

630
00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:28.020
rejected from reality itself and so we
make our own worlds our Barbie world we

631
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.800
build our dream houses and in them we
casually discuss the changing

632
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.839
manifestations of gender the way the
straight and CIS makes small talk over

633
00:44:36.839 --> 00:44:42.240
the changing weather as the idea of the
stereotypical Barbie left Barbie land it

634
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.420
was because the idea of Barbie had
become real

635
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.859
it was no longer an ideal that little
girls could only hope to project into

636
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:53.099
their future this Barbie became
something little girls can actually grow

637
00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:59.460
up to be and all of us outside the
confines of accepted normal long for

638
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.260
that in some capacity
many of us want to exist in these

639
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:09.720
Suburban spaces raising a family the way
the Straits would but that's not what

640
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:16.079
real means not for everyone
to be real is to be seen and

641
00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:20.160
acknowledged in spite of lifestyle and
choices

642
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.859
to be taken as a for granted in what one
may expect to see to make no

643
00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:31.140
justifications or exceptions to be
unexceptional and accepted to face no

644
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:36.000
friction for whatever one is or however
one would choose to live to be able to

645
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.500
justify one's own life regardless of
whether it is a choice or not without

646
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.180
needing to be born a certain way to
justify one's own existence

647
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.160
and whether swimming with the current or
against it we all want to feel as if we

648
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.000
exist
and someday soon the idea of Barbie May

649
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.079
no longer be just a concept
that a person who people think of as

650
00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:04.800
less than women people of color queer
people really can be anything

651
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.480
as this idea enters into the real world
the original idea that facilitated her

652
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.400
is no longer just an idea
it becomes reality

653
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.160
ideas are fixed and static standing
still waiting to become real

654
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.280
the role we play
is deciding which ideas may become real

655
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.140
because anything really is possible

656
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.319
so don't let anyone
keep you inside of a box

657
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.700
oh and Barbie is absolutely asexual

658
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.040
foreign

659
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.540
foreign

660
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.400
thank you

661
00:48:50.819 --> 00:48:53.480
thank you
