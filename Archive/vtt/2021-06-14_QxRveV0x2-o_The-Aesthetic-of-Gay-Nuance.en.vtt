00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.720
Yuri on Ice is a 2016 anime about Yuri Katsukai,
a 24 year old figure skater from Japan whose

2
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.700
pretty much convinced that he’s past his
prime. Until his idol, world famous Russian

3
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.279
figure Victor Nikiforov shows up in Yuri’s
small town to coach him into being a champion

4
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.279
himself.

5
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.300
I’ve been told for almost an entire year
that I need to watch Yuri On Ice. People on

6
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.240
YouTube. People on Twitter. People on Facebook.
All telling me I need to watch it. That I’d

7
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.400
love it, and that it’s super gay. When I
mentioned it to a few friends they were honestly

8
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:56.480
shocked I hasn’t seen it. So, finally, begrudgingly,
I watched it. Spoilers ahead.

9
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:35.440
And I want to be absolutely blunt, before
we get into this. I’ve made a kind of career

10
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.400
here on YouTube talking about queer coding
in media. How gay characters are almost never

11
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.680
shown, and just hinted at. And it’s incredibly
frustrating, queer coding that is. And I was

12
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.480
warned before watching Yuri on Ice that it
was total queer bait, but I watched it anyway.

13
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.140
And after watching both the sub’d and dub’d
versions, I can say that this is actually

14
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.600
the kind of representation that I’ve been
asking for. Could it have used an on-screen

15
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.960
kiss? I mean sure. The arm-in-front-of-mouth
felt a little forced when it’s abundantly

16
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.560
clear what was going on.

17
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.640
But… it didn’t really need two men kissing
in public. Because its queerness… wasn’t

18
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.920
subtle at all.

19
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.910
In fact the subtlety was lacking to such an
extent that it boggles my mind that there

20
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.750
are fans online who argue that Yuri and Victor
are straight.

21
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.170
Straight.

22
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.590
Yes.

23
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.019
Absolutely.

24
00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.000
This is…

25
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.960
pique heterosexuality.

26
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.310
Granted, the English voice dub is much more
homosexually explicit, whereas the subtitled

27
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.391
version is less textual. Granted, a key component
of creative licence in Japanese media is for

28
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.770
the audience to take implicit details for
granted. So, in the culture of media consumption

29
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.180
in Japan, yes, those little gay cues are meant
to be read into.

30
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.550
Going through it three times total, the gay…ness
of the whole thing became so much more apparent

31
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.930
each time that the only way I can possibly
account for anyone saying that this is straight

32
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.880
is a bunch of women and girls who are exercising
the most willful ignorance I’ve had the

33
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.590
displeasure of being exposed to. Which, honestly,
if the complete lack of women in this sausage

34
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.430
fest isn’t a tip off, the literal only textual
antagonist in this first season is one who

35
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.340
refuses to stop shoving his heterosexual lifestyle
in everyone’s faces.

36
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.830
I can understand why a lot of North American
viewers wouldn’t get the message though.

37
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.240
There’s no grand, bombastic soapbox moment
where either Yuri or Victor stand in front

38
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.440
of a crowd to declare their sexuality… except
the scene where Yuri declares his love for

39
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.190
Victor on live TV. But besides that.

40
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.540
And neither was there a whole media push to
promote these gay characters, in which the

41
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.040
network and creator can pat themselves on
the back, Disney “first gay character”

42
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040
style.

43
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.690
If a studio or network isn’t blasting their
own self-promotional circle-jerk across the

44
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.940
internet, how do we know for certain that
a character is gay? And even if they are gay,

45
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.510
how do we know it’s gay representation if
a giant, money-grubbing straight, family-values

46
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.370
corporation isn’t telling a swarm of queers
that this is gay representation? How gay is

47
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.830
gay enough for it to be gay… without us
having to be told it is?

48
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.180
Now, I know what you’re thinking. I’ve
spent most of my tenure on YouTube railing

49
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.729
against media producers for using copouts
when it comes to any kind of representation.

50
00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.160
Using the whole ‘it’s there if you look
for it’ queer coding and baiting doesn’t

51
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.909
really fly with me in most cases.

52
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.779
But at some point, the question of ‘how
gay is gay enough’ must become ‘why do

53
00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:53.120
we have to project our gay all the way to
the cheap seats in the back?’

54
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.729
How gay does something need to be for people
to appreciate it’s gayness?

55
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.870
Not even that. At what point are people gonna
stop telling gay people what is or isn’t

56
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.520
a gay experience?

57
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.610
Because you have something, Yuri!!! On ICE,
in which the story benefits from subtlety.

58
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.759
But apparently, we’re not allowed to have
nuanced depictions of gay experiences because

59
00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.460
unless we’re showing up on a pride float
weraring a leather harness and puppy hood,

60
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.249
there’s a whole swath of people who will
insist we don’t exist.

61
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:29.689
The thing is… rubbing our sexuality in everyone’s
faces just to prove we exist does get exhausting

62
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.300
for us, and in order to prove our existence,
we get stuck in a cycle where our existence

63
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.729
is based solely on our sexuality and sex.
And so, our existence is deemed not appropriate

64
00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.189
for all audiences.

65
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:48.279
Victor shouldn’t NEED to have Yuri bent
over a bench in order to justify and demonstrate

66
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.999
their sexual and romantic leanings when the
emotional simplicity is focused on a much

67
00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.900
more wholesome depiction.

68
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.630
Mostly.

69
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.849
To the point where… yeah I think this is
better queer representation than the overwhelming

70
00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.550
bulk of American films, television shows,
and even comic books have had to offer in

71
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.550
recent memory.

72
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.220
At which point before going on, I feel obliged
to erase any shadow of a doubt to confirm

73
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.559
that, yes, even through inference only, this
is qualifiabley gay — and maybe even queer

74
00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:21.779
- representation.

75
00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.819
To The Network’s credit, they did everything
they could to keep as much of the gay out

76
00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.310
of Yuri!!! On ICE. From arms-in-front-of-kisses
to obscuring as much of the romantic details

77
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.010
as possible. There’s no plausible deniability
that there are a slew of gay characters in

78
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.909
this show… but it is possible. Not plausible,
but possible. Straights are great at that.

79
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.120
As I mentioned, Japanese media is meant to
be read into — where heavy-handed details

80
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.669
are generally frowned upon. What’s inferred
is meant to be taken for granted.  Both

81
00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.969
Kristoff and Victor, almost naked, jumping
into Yuri’s bed in Barcelona itself is not

82
00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.779
meant to be dismissed as a ‘just friends
thing.’ After all, we here in continental

83
00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:06.919
America have a joke about male figure skaters
all being gay — I can’t imagine that there

84
00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.939
isn’t that reputation elsewhere. I’m comfortable
saying that the show’s displays of affection

85
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:17.110
and romance are meant to co-incide with an
already-present expectation of male figure

86
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.110
skaters.

87
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.189
Because scenes like this, with no dialogue
contains a visual language which does not

88
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:29.289
need translation. Seriously… this scene
was basically lifted from a 2000s Kate Hudson

89
00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.289
romance.

90
00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:32.900
Personally, as a visual learner, and a film
director, I’m a little disappointed that

91
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.610
we are apparently so incapable of trusting
visual language here in the West. But that’s

92
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.580
a whole other video on its own.

93
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.530
Because the vast majority of queer content
in Yuri!!! On ICE is visual language.

94
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.710
I mean… we’ve been demanding to be seen,
right?

95
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.059
And if a gay person saying: “Hey, this is
a pretty gay experience” isn’t enough,

96
00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:59.460
there’s more than enough textual evidence
to indicate that this is a cast of gay and

97
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.159
bi figure skaters.

98
00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:02.870
Except for JJ. The straights can have him.

99
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.210
Because aside from the airport scene, the
engagement, and an overall comfort with nudity,

100
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.930
Victor and Yuri routinely share a bed.

101
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.059
And then there’s the repudiative public
almost-love declarations that are projected

102
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:19.939
at the public during broadcasts. I mean I
get that dismantling toxic masculinity involves

103
00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:24.639
a process of making it acceptable to tell
your best bro that you love him, but there’s

104
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:29.990
a difference between wanting the best for
your bro and wanting to $#^% him.

105
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.300
The engagement scene, and it is an engagement
scene, is really the only part of the series

106
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.479
that I disliked. It just reads like a no-homo
copout that the network made the creators

107
00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:45.730
slip in there. Probably as a compromise so
that they could have a gay engagement in the

108
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.810
first place.

109
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.029
But you also get a scene where two naked men
jump into Yuri’s bed and his only objection

110
00:08:53.029 --> 00:09:00.490
is about how cold their feet are. Which maybe
you could argue this is a straight boy thing,

111
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:08.520
but then we’re getting desperately close
to the territory of staged straight-bait porn.

112
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.190
And couple that with the yearning, the pining,
the numerous confessions, the hand, holding,

113
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.949
the hugging, the emotional support crying,
the complete lack of female love interests.

114
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:24.601
And like. Sure. Take a couple of these things
and you can argue that it’s straight? If

115
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:25.601
you wanna be mean.

116
00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:30.949
Why do you want the gays to have FEWER icons?
Jesus. We can still get fired for being gay

117
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.620
in most states, can you at least let us have
anime male figure skaters?

118
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.839
But add all of it together and it simply does
not fit the bill for plausible deniability.

119
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.139
And it’s not like Yuri and Victor are the
only queer ones—

120
00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:49.560
The show makes it abundantly clear when a
figure skater has alleged heterosexual inclinations.

121
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.130
Also the… brother and sister who are…
very committed.

122
00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.029
But as for other characters… is it possible
for catboys to be straight? [Yurio with the

123
00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:03.290
ears.] No really, are there any straight catboys?
I’m curious.

124
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.000
Aside from joking around, I can’t really
think of any other excuse for why a 15 year

125
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.940
old, bereft of adult supervision, would so
vehemently flee a swarm of rabid fangirls

126
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.030
only to wind up riding bitch for a hunky slav.
Followed by this scene.

127
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:22.400
On a vista overlooking the sun setting and
everything. Come on.

128
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.399
What more does it have to take?

129
00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:28.820
Why is it that not until boys are literally
putting their bodies together for skin-on-skin

130
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.410
contact that some people will insist that
this type of situation is completely hetero.

131
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:47.579
I’ve actually heard this is pretty bad for
sports anime.

132
00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:51.920
At which point I consider it a failure of
Western ’queer representation’, where

133
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.190
Western audiences cannot recognize queer characters
by inference alone.

134
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.370
And so… one has to wonder… what is causing
this denial in media analysis? What makes

135
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:14.970
some American audiences require their media
to be so much more… explicit?

136
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.329
Subtlety as a staple of Japanese storytelling
extends not only to modern media but also

137
00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:24.440
the mythological cycle, the very way in which
ancient Japanese historians recorded their

138
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.800
legends, and then re-recorded those documents.
Small gentures, like nods or turning one’s

139
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.510
head slightly, were recorded in detail, and
were meant to signify a clear, nonverbal message.

140
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.070
Which not only was used to characterize the
individuals in the story, whether fiction,

141
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.579
history, or fictionalized history, but to
explain and justify the actions of characters

142
00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:46.680
or figures.

143
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.069
In many instances, a piece of media is meant
to be read into. This isn’t to say that

144
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:58.459
every piece of Japanese media is meant to
be subtle and deeply enriching.

145
00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:03.800
But this does say that this is an audience
that has been conditioned to seek out smaller

146
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.569
inferences and put it into the context of
the work as a whole. An audience which is

147
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:13.620
conditioned to be aware that all aspects of
a given piece of fiction are placed there

148
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:19.110
deliberately by the creator, and therefore
are meant to ask why that is. And as a result,

149
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.310
in order to fully appreciate the media, you,
the observer, are invited to extract details.

150
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.350
That’s one of the reasons fandom culture
is so intense in Japan.

151
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.500
So… scenes which are implicitly romantic
in setting, emotional context, and body language

152
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.839
seem out of place in an anime which is seemingly
exclusively about figure skating. Why is that?

153
00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:44.019
No really, would it not seem super weird to
dedicate so much time and energy to depicting

154
00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:48.079
the ‘platonic’ relationship between a
figure skater and a coach in such a sensual

155
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:53.470
way in straight media? As far as implicit
gay content goes, Yuri!!! On ICE has the writing

156
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.170
written more clearly on the wall than some
explicit queer content.

157
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:03.700
Due to the complexity of the models and expressions,
there is greater permission for more of the

158
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.230
story and characters to exist in visual language.
Because visual language does not require a

159
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.449
translation, I’d also be willing to say
this is a significant reason for the growing

160
00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:15.259
global popularity of Anime.

161
00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:19.170
This is especially true when we factor in
an over-arching element of Japanese culture,

162
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.430
which is much more reserved when it comes
to public displays of affection — at least

163
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.980
next to America. And especially next to Switzerland.

164
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.850
However, as I mentioned, audiences conditioned
to expect American media to be very blunt

165
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:38.200
are at the same time more cynical, and unwilling
to read into the subtext of a given property.

166
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.459
The english voice-dub of Yuri!!! On ICE is
much more explicit in it’s depictions of

167
00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:46.140
queerness — which matches the sensibilities
of audiences in Americanized nations. And

168
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.292
I’m not trying to say that one version of
Yuri!!! On ICE is better than the other. Honestly

169
00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:48.292
the difference in translation is so subtle,
that it isn’t that noticeable. The instances

170
00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:56.540
of visual language make up the bulk of queer
coding in either version.

171
00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.420
American audiences though, are far more conditioned
to overt messaging. Cue another person who

172
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.420
thinks that Fightclub is a celebration of
toxic masculinity.

173
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.560
And I mean it’s not really our fault. Euro-American
media as a whole seems to be driven more and

174
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.550
more towards an elimination of nuance. Whether
that’s because of Hollywood or whether Hollywood

175
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.129
has been responding to and demand. But it
seems that American media has been edging

176
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:20.190
more and more towards a situation where the
audience is encouraged to do as little as

177
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.150
possible to engage with their media.

178
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:28.509
I hear stories about people going to movie
theatres in America, and am a little shocked

179
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:33.189
to hear just how… frequently people will
have whole conversations while a movie is

180
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:39.170
going on, or just be on their phone. I don’t
know how you guys function. Where I am, being

181
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.680
in a movie theatre is kinda… sacred. You’re
there to watch a movie, not to have a conversation.

182
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.510
And put your damn phone away.

183
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.360
Granted, this culture of movie-theatre discussions
go back to the beginning of movie theatres

184
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.010
in general, where people in city centres would
escape summer heat in cinemas — one of the

185
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.560
only structures at the time that was air-conditioned.
A necessity due the to flammability of early

186
00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.990
nitrate based film.

187
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.930
And, as people weren’t necessarily paying
attention to what was on the screen, a film

188
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.610
would still be received negatively by movie
goers if they didn’t know what was going

189
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:13.670
on or if they didn’t pick up on certain
details. This lead to a trend in films to

190
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.670
reach for grand spectacles instead of nuanced
character dramas. Enter Cecil B Demill and

191
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.670
his biblical epics.

192
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.970
It wasn’t until the 60s that acting, plots,
and direction style shifted to a more natural,

193
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.570
humanistic level of expression. The film version
of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woof’ was

194
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:34.019
a marked shift in popular styles of filmmaking
towards a more subtle style of realistic nuance.

195
00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:37.620
Coupled with the american culture of consuming
Television programming, and entertainment

196
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.160
was very much something that was there to
be on in the background while people went

197
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.689
about their lives. Repeating information to
make sure that the message got across. That’s

198
00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:50.339
why so many TV shows actually repeat the last
bit of the last scene after a commercial break.

199
00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:51.420
To this day.

200
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.839
And it wasn’t until recently in American
Television that shows were designed for you

201
00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:59.290
to pick up on subtlety, with examples like
Arrested Development, the first few seasons

202
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.830
of Game of Thrones, and especially Breaking
Bad.

203
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:06.370
It may go deeper than Hollywood though. Compare
Japanese mythological storytelling conventions

204
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.629
to ‘western’ ones. Modern stories, in
one way or another, are always constructed

205
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:15.300
on the foundation of ancient mythological
cycles. For this, European stories were made

206
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.339
on a tradition stemming from Roman and Greek
poems, as well as Abrahamic parables.

207
00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:24.310
In either case, the narrative convention of
these styles very much lean towards the explicit.

208
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.779
Dialogue is over-rought, clear in it’s delivery,
with the intention to convey complete meaning

209
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.920
in the spoken word alone. Though… it’s
really hit or miss with that. Turns out that

210
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.699
after 2500 years of the bible, some of the
old meaning has been lost in translation.

211
00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:42.720
European theatrical conventions also focused
exclusively on an actor’s ability to deliver

212
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:48.300
lines, and what the lines themselves say.
In the Elizabethan era, it was common to simply

213
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.959
not have a set or props for a given production.
And so, some of you may have noticed that

214
00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:57.259
Shakespeare goes to great lengths to have
his actors describe what a given set looks

215
00:16:57.259 --> 00:17:02.089
like, what the weather is like, how dark it
is. The responsibility of the actors was not

216
00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:07.140
to show this via acting, but telling via dialogue.
They couldn’t really afford to “show don’t

217
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.820
tell” until film came along.

218
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.209
Compare and contrast to a Japanese performance
art like Kabuki… which has markedly less

219
00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:18.170
dialogue and which the audience is more encouraged
to read into how a given performer is carrying

220
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.930
themselves, their gestures, their expressions.
How they move. Why they move. A single look

221
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.450
can mean as much as, or more than, a Shakespearean
sonnet.

222
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.910
That’s why a lot of Western audiences really
don’t get why people love ballet and fashion.

223
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:38.150
That’s ALL show and no tell. In both of
those cases — they are not seen as ‘accessable’

224
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.560
because most people have not developed the
sensibilities needed to analyze how well a

225
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.750
given balerina is pretending to be a swan.

226
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.950
So yes, among Western audiences there is an
expectation that media will hold their hand

227
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.390
and guide them through every element of the
plot. Thought process being ‘if the creator

228
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.920
wants me to know about something in their
media, they will tell me that it is important.’

229
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.110
Hitchcock famously got around this by SHOWING
you something important three times, but not

230
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.470
necessarily talking about it even once. That
way it’s hard to miss but he’s not spilling

231
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.330
the whole mystery for the viewers who are
actually paying attention.

232
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.530
Conversely, the argument for nuance goes:
‘if the creator has something important

233
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.490
to say in this media, they will reward me
by letting me figure it out for myself.’

234
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.610
Basically the golden rule of David Lynch.

235
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.910
Which way is better? Depends on the storyteller,
the story, and the audience.

236
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:31.330
There’s actually been a centuries-long debate
within art criticism. Do we, as art critics,

237
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.470
observe the work as it was intended, only
factoring in the cultural attitudes that the

238
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.850
author was deliberately feeding into their
art. Or do we analyze in spite of the author’s

239
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.810
intentions, factoring other iconographic connections
that the author was not necessarily intending,

240
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.330
but that enriches the work nevertheless.

241
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.190
Many authors, in biographies and interviews
will often speak to assumptions of their work:

242
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.520
symbolic value, allegory, allusion — and
oftentimes they admit that what is being read

243
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.970
into their work was never intended. For instance,
after being consistently questioned on the

244
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.760
feminist power of Carrie, Stephen King admitted
that he had never intended for it to be viewed

245
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.450
under such a feminist lens.

246
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.150
Instead, he said that after reading his first
draft, he noticed a reoccurring pattern of

247
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.050
blood. And in subsequent drafts, highlighted
these elements further. The result was a story

248
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.410
which, under a certain interpretation, spoke
to a way that women find power because of

249
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.870
and in spite of suffering.

250
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.150
Does King’s lack of deliberate intention
diminish the art or the artist?

251
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.220
I would argue: no. The ability for an artist
to focus on developing a good story, while

252
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.540
subliminally including elements that speak
to a culture at large is an outstanding talent.

253
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:48.220
And sadly, many who have this talent are often
plagued with lifelong inadequacy issues, imposter

254
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:54.100
complexes, and frequently opt to give up before
they hit their stride because others hold

255
00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:04.120
them up against artists who appear to do it
all seamlessly… Those who, also, would have

256
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.360
openly admitted to not having the slightest
clue what they’re doing, but happen to do

257
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.210
the right thing so nobody bothers to ask.

258
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.411
And in this respect, Yuri!!! On ICE exists
as a triumph of gay representation. Before

259
00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:20.420
it set out to do anything, it was going to
tell a good story. Where most stories function

260
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.550
around telling people how to succeed, Yuri!!!
On ICE was primarily about how not to give

261
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.520
up.

262
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.470
Really, the nail in the coffin should have
been the direct message from the creator.

263
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.080
“Yuri and Victor are gay, and in a relationship.”
She said that—

264
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.870
So that really should be the end of it. We’re
not gonna do anything else to talk about why

265
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.660
Victor and Yuri are queer. It’s a thing.
Be mad.

266
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.250
But… Japan has certain laws, such as what
time of night a queer-centric show can be

267
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.610
aired on TV. This show was slated for an earlier
timeslot in the night because its first a

268
00:20:55.610 --> 00:21:01.020
foremost a sports anime. In order for the
quiet part to be as loud as the creator wanted,

269
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.670
it would have have to air much later at night
than the network wanted. Probably not reach

270
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.220
as wide an audience because of it, and definitely
not have the same amount of advertising behind

271
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.220
it.

272
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.550
What the creator did with presenting an obviously
gay story while still appeasing the censorship

273
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:23.370
regulations was… just an all round masterclass
in network trolling. She had a gay thing that

274
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.850
was, more or less approved for all ages—

275
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:33.110
—And wanted to project it out to as large
an audience as possible, while still preserving

276
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:38.161
the queer elements of the story. So, she had
to compromise her artistic vision, appease

277
00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:43.540
the network demands, and develop a quality
program that would appeal to audiences.

278
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.840
The easiest thing to do in this situation
would be to develop a token straight love

279
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.420
interest for Yuri and/or Victor. That way,
with heterosexuality confirmed, the creator

280
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.050
would have a lot more leeway from the studio
to do what she wanted. But instead, and I

281
00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:02.420
strongly approve of this, she coded elements
of queerness so strongly that they are absolutely

282
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.860
unmissable, and yet, she can argue to the
network that it matches the straight-leaning

283
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.090
sensibility of network standards.

284
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:24.010
I don’t know how much you know about show
business but being able to do that without

285
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:29.840
sacrificing the integrity of the project is
absolutely incredible. As a comparison of

286
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.210
how things can go terribly wrong, Nickelodeon
fought tooth and nail against the creative

287
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.970
team of Legend of Korra, who wanted to present
a queer woman of colour. Which were, at the

288
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.210
time, three words that the network did not
want to hear in a pitch.

289
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.900
Unfortunately, for whatever reason, there
was little effort made to code Korra as ‘queer’

290
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.050
— maybe it was even a studio note to force
Korra into a number of Love triangles with

291
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:59.080
other men, and a continuing on-again-off-again
relationship with a male supporting character.

292
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.880
Eventually going so far as to push the final
seasons of the show onto their web only platform

293
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.270
because they knew Korra and Asami were going
to hold hands in the final shot and, well,

294
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.740
we can’t put that on TV, now can we?

295
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.380
And that isn’t to say that Yuri!!! On ICE
did not suffer it’s own managerial problems.

296
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.640
There were insane deadlines on the animation
department so the skating scenes suffer from

297
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.530
some painful frame drops, the script for each
episode was roughly twice as long as the network

298
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.970
permitted, so a lot of character development
for smaller characters had to be dropped.

299
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.150
And it very well may be that the more explicit
gay content had to be cut for time constrains

300
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.770
as well as network appeasement.

301
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.570
And yet, the creative team very masterfully
used the time resources they had to advance

302
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:47.970
the already-constricted plot at the same time
as dropping some gay bombs. And, maybe even

303
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:53.330
as a happy accident, used nuance to their
advantage to make queer content that benefitted

304
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.270
from having no explicit discussion of homosexuality.

305
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:02.720
Because Yuri!!! On ICE is not about queerness.
It’s about queer people, but it’s not

306
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.441
about qualifying the validity of their personhood
based on their capacity for queerness. Their

307
00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:11.990
queerness is neither the first nor the second
thing that comes to mind when discussing their

308
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.140
roles in the plot, and the roles they have
to other characters.

309
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.320
This includes the relationship between Victor
and Yuri.

310
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.620
And this isn’t to say you aren’t meant
to see the queerness, nor that this story

311
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.100
is not meant to be seen as a love story. But
it is meant to say that the characters have

312
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:30.500
a purpose beyond letting the audience know
that they’re here and they’re queer. Because,

313
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.740
speaking from my experiences as a gay person,
I can safely say that ‘being gay’ is not

314
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.900
what’s on my mind most of the time. I don’t
feel the need to qualify my gayness either

315
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.700
to a partner, family or the rest of society.

316
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.550
In the same way, Yuri and Victor do not need
to have an exchange that goes along the lines

317
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.550
of:

318
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:55.660
“But… I’m a boy like you! W-why are
you holding my hand!?!”

319
00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:01.260
“Ever since I was young… I knew I was
different… and I was drawn to you because…

320
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.970
you’re also different — like I saw in
myself years ago!”

321
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.440
They know they’re gay. They don’t need
to have a heart-to-heart about it because

322
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.950
that does not benefit them, as characters.
Doing so is only to benefit an audience and

323
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.410
would, as a result, break the emotional realism
of the scene.

324
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.890
And in doing so this speaks to a queer experience
that is much more realistic, and identifiable.

325
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:30.860
And so, by keeping the queerness coded — ironically
— this moves closer into an experience that

326
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:36.770
is intended to be appreciated by queer people.
Rather than presenting a queer experience

327
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.010
for the intention of being consumed by straight
people.

328
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:46.000
In fact, the lack of clarity also affords
a, perhaps accidental instance of nonbinary

329
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.210
representation, specifically from Yuri. As
per elements of the show, he is much more

330
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.500
comfortable skating his programs as a woman.

331
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.310
He spares no expense to clarify that he feels
like he doesn’t belong with the other men,

332
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.450
and any time the word ‘man’ is used in
the entirety of the show, it is always in

333
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.960
a period of great anxiety for Yuri himself.

334
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.970
Victor also started out his career looking
very androgynous, bending the separation between

335
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:19.950
male and female, if not shattering it.

336
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:26.010
So at this point I ask myself — what is
the difference between representation, coding,

337
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:32.350
pandering, and baiting? And is drawing a distinction
necessary? After all, it would be unfair to

338
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.150
act like Yuri on Ice is the only piece of
media ever produced to have subtle queer representation.

339
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.670
The problem is that in most other cases, the
representation isn't so much subtle as it

340
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:46.290
is simply not acknowledged. It would be easy
to just drop my series of queer baiting videos

341
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.520
right here, but there’s been a few movies
that have come out since then that I’d rather

342
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.750
talk about. We’ll drop them into two categories.
Queer representation, and Queer Pandering.

343
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.470
See if you can tell which is which.

344
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.090
Disney’s Cruella.

345
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.860
I wasn’t sure what to expect from Cruella,
to be honest. Disney was already trumpeting

346
00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.170
it as their “First Out Gay Character”,
the third or forth such character in the last

347
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:12.620
few years, so I was preparing myself for a
big ole eye roll. But it never came. 

348
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.990
The gay character in question, Arty, a fashionista
who helps Cruella create her devilish looks

349
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:21.280
throughout the film, didn’t silently pine
over any of the male characters, wasn’t

350
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.300
abused for his queerness, and didn’t exist
just to give Cruella someone to talk to. He

351
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.290
was active in the plot, helping her create
the looks she would use to bring down her

352
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.610
rival The Baronesse, performs live on stage
at an impromptu Cruella fashion show, and

353
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.400
isn’t just forgotten when the plot moves
past him. In the closing scenes of the film

354
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.950
he’s among Cruella’s crew. Jasper and
Horace are there, of course, but so is Arty.

355
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.670
Meaning he’s probably coming back for the
sequel Disney currently has in development.

356
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.290
Now plenty of queer people have pointed out
that it’s never stated in that he is in

357
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:57.840
fact gay, which is true. But he’s pure camp,
with his Bowie inspired looks, and even talks

358
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.440
about being beaten up for being different.
He doesn’t say he’s gay, or show romantic

359
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.890
interest in any other characters, but nobody
does. Though Jasper might have a crush on

360
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.560
Cruella, she doesn’t seem to reciprocate,
and it could easily be read a brother/sister

361
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.750
type of situation. Jasper’s heterosexuality
is just as subtle as Arty’s homosexuality.

362
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:20.010
Cruella, on the other hand, never even gives
a longing look to anything that isn’t fabric.

363
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.720
Leading me to believe that maybe, just maybe,
Cruella might fall onto the ACE spectrum.

364
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.950
Which, if she was still a puppy killer would
be pretty bad ACE representation. But as it

365
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.140
seems she’s reformed her ways from Disney’s
last version of her to this one, she’s less

366
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.970
bad guy and more bad ass. 

367
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.810
So the queerness is Cruella is subtle, and
does require the audience to understand at

368
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.750
least a bit of the history of camp and androgyny,
but it’s some of the better queer rep I’ve

369
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:49.050
seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie, especially
from Disney. I’m sure they’ll eliminate

370
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.390
my current good will once they release that
River Cruise movie though. 

371
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.510
Next!
Ah, more Disney. 

372
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.380
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

373
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.820
The live action one.

374
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:04.120
Now this ones been discussed to death. LeFou,
the gay under our microscope here, is just

375
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.200
bad representation. Firstly, his name literally
means “The Fool”, so hurray us. Secondly,

376
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.260
he pines after the biggest jock in town, whose
an absolute asshole to everyone including

377
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.390
him. As if we never grow out the bad habits
we pick up in grade school. His character

378
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.390
is a villain until he’s suddenly not. When
he suddenly has a change of heart, has a heart

379
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.919
to heart with Mrs Pots about Gaston, and realizes
he deserves a better boyfriend. Or at least

380
00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.200
someone better to pine over. 

381
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.070
So he ends up dancing with, or at least embracing,
one of the townies we spotted for a split

382
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.340
second earlier in the film. This was Disney’s
“Exclusively gay” moment, by the way.

383
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.320
Something that the films director, out gay
filmmaker Bill Condon, played up in the press

384
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.440
for literally months beforehand. Creating
much controversy from parents groups and much

385
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.510
anticipation from gay fans. After all, Beauty
and the Beast was Howard Ashmen’s swan song

386
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:55.290
before his untimely death from complications
due to AIDS, so it would be a fitting tribute

387
00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:00.130
to him to finally put a real gay character
in a Disney movie. And then the scene happened

388
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.410
and the audience said… that was it?

389
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:09.250
Yes, that was it. Like Star Wars The Rise
of Skywalker would do two years later, the

390
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.610
exclusive gay moment was a blink and you miss
it shot, not SCENE, a shot. 

391
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.360
But enough about Disney. I don’t expect
anything wonderfully gay to come from the

392
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.610
Mouse House anytime soon. And no, a sexless
married gay superhero with kids in a minor

393
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:28.450
supporting role in The Eternals does not count.
I said good representation, not boring representation.

394
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.600
So let’s talk about some real gay super
heroes.

395
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.410
THE OLD GUARD
The Old Guard was a 2020 Netflix action movie

396
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.450
about a group of functionally immortal bad
asses. They think they’re the last of their

397
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.980
kind but when a new one pops up, seemingly
out of nowhere, it leads to a race against

398
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.480
time to keep her safe from a conniving capitalist
swine. 

399
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.930
Two of the aforementioned immortal badasses
are a gay couple. Joe and Nicky. Characters

400
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.630
whose sexuality is so subtle at first its
literally in the background, out of focus.

401
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.880
Early on in the film you’re not even likely
to notice the knowing looks they give each

402
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.000
other, or even notice them spooning in the
back of a scene. But then BAM, they’re kidnapped

403
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.290
and their lives are seemingly in danger so
they declare their literally undying love

404
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:38.790
for one another. And goddammit it works. This
crazy, over the top action movie that would

405
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:44.490
make some of the Fast and Furious movies look
subtle has, hands down, the best gay representation

406
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.660
I’ve ever seen in a Hollywood movie. The
gays don’t die. They’re not depressed

407
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.590
about being gay. Nobody wants to kill them
for being gay. It’s just… a thing they

408
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.770
are. Something that has, really, nothing to
do with the plot. They could have been straight

409
00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:03.071
buds but, instead, they’re gay. They just
happen to be gay. And it is perfect. Unlike

410
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:07.070
most gay characters they survive to the end
and will be in the sequel, which Netflix green-lit

411
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:12.400
earlier this year. The movie was a huge success
for Netflix and other than gay media, almost

412
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:18.210
nobody mentioned Joe and Nicky. Why? Because
Netflix didn’t put out a press release declaring

413
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.930
“WE HAVE A GAY! TWO OF EM!”

414
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.210
They just let the gays exist like they would
any straight character. They were just there.

415
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:31.060
Their queerness completely incidental to the
plot, just like every other characters straightness.

416
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.610
I was so shocked by this that I barely knew
what to think when I watched it. An action

417
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:41.090
movie with gay characters. An action movie
with gay heroes? An action movie with gay

418
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.650
heroes who don’t die?

419
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.000
WHAT IS THIS? Opposite land?! Did the pandemic
cause a new reality to open up?

420
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.680
Sadly, no. No new reality, just a single ripple
in spacetime that felt a bit different. Not

421
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.110
a whole lot of incidentally gay characters
popping up in action movies since then. But

422
00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.180
one did come out just before it:

423
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:06.820
The Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation
of one Harley Quinn

424
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.060
DC and Warner Bros managed to make a good
movie and then cancelled the sequel. Color

425
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.060
me surprised.

426
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.600
This rollercoaster of colorful sets, audacious
costumes, bonkers action, and off the cuff

427
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.320
queer references (Harley is confirmed to have
dated women even before the opening title)

428
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.491
was the last movie I saw in theatres before
the pandemic hit. And it was a hell of a ride

429
00:33:24.491 --> 00:33:25.491
to go out on. 

430
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:29.890
Now, as a movie news nerd I followed the production
of Birds of Prey pretty closely. So I knew

431
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.570
that WB actually sent this thing back for
reshoots at least once because they decided,

432
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:39.290
late in the game, that a certain plot point
was a bit too risque for them. You see, originally,

433
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:43.940
Ewan McGregor’s Black Mask was 100% confirmed
to be gay in the movie, and the reason he

434
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.370
was after the Bertinelli diamond wasn’t
for the money, but because it contained data

435
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:56.910
inside. Data that, when read, would reveal
him in compromised positions. And his dick

436
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.910
pics. 

437
00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:58.910
I’m not kidding. 

438
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.930
Black Mask, or Roman Sianos, was a bit of
a kinky bottom you see. And heaven help the

439
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.350
woman who let that info leak out to the rest
of Gotham’s underworld.

440
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.129
But WB got cold feet and called for reshoots.
Simplifying the plot and vaguely straight

441
00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:15.950
washing Roman and his serial killing henchman
/ dom top, Victor Zazz. Oh the movie we could

442
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:17.520
have had if it weren’t for corporate meddling.

443
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.850
But the queerness of the couple is still abundantly
clear. Roman never says he’s queer but when

444
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.310
he’s rocking a pink silk kimono while dancing
around with a martini, I don’t think it

445
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.480
needs be remarked. 

446
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:36.020
Ewan McGregor's acting has a campy quality
to it that reminds me of villain in a John

447
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:44.600
Waters movie. Now, the queer community doesn’t
really like queer coded villains these days,

448
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:51.919
which is pretty understandable. But in this
case, exceptions can and should be made. 

449
00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:56.240
Some of the Birds of Prey media discussion
was focused on how the film despises men or

450
00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.800
portrays white men as villains. That isn't
entirely accurate, but the film does have

451
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.510
a slew of terrible men with a similar appearance.
What interests me about this is that Roman

452
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.421
and Victor are examples of these evil men.
They aren't macho clichés of men, and they

453
00:35:10.421 --> 00:35:14.860
don't sexualize the female characters in the
film. Roman shifting into the Black Mask persona

454
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.920
and forcing a woman to pull off her clothing
is one example where it doesn't feel like

455
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.130
he's doing it for the sexual thrills, but
for the control. He also didn't want the dress

456
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.950
in his club because it was a crime against
fashion. And unlike murder, some laws should

457
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:35.320
never be broken. (but fashion has changed
- no it hasnt - serial mom clip)

458
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:42.060
So is Black Mask GOOD representation of queer
men? No, of course not. But is he an interesting

459
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.430
character with more going for him than just
being the gay character. Yes. And that’s

460
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:53.890
what we need. We need characters who are MORE
than just the gay one.

461
00:35:53.890 --> 00:36:03.770
This puts me in a difficult situation, as
it may not be clear what I’m advocating

462
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.840
for. On one hand, I’m praising various instances
of subtlety in media when it comes to queer

463
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.000
representation, while condemning other attempts
to make more ‘overtly’ queer media. But

464
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.810
what I’m saying is that we don’t necessarily
need to chose between one or the other.

465
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.930
Our representation would get boring if we,
as a group, decided that there was only one

466
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.840
way to represent us. In that case, it would
be a gross disservice to the vast range of

467
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.430
diversity in the queer experience. There isn’t
one way to be queer — there isn’t even

468
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:37.130
one way to be gay. But my problem with ‘explicit’
representation in modern media is that you

469
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.170
wouldn’t know that from the way we are represented.

470
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:46.690
Maybe in thise case, it’s best to focus
less on depicting queer instances—

471
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:53.000
—and instead place that focus on depicting
queer experiences.

472
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.540
Making sure we push queer characters into
fiction doesn’t seem to be having the desired

473
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:04.140
effect of having our people and communities
seen. As the end result is a matter of taking

474
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.300
queer characters and making their motives
and backgrounds indistinguishable from straight

475
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:13.020
characters. Reminiscent of saying we deserve
gay marriage because we’re ‘just like’

476
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.740
heterosexual couples. We aren’t. We have
different social experiences with society

477
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.480
at large.

478
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.960
Our coming-of-age experiences, as they fit
outside the projected norm, are not the norm.

479
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.150
And depicting queer characters as being ‘straight
characters but gay’ is a disservice to the

480
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.170
way that the process of self-discovery and
independence shapes us.

481
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:40.810
We’re NOT like everyone else. And that’s
what we should be proud of. We’re not even

482
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:45.290
always like each other — and it should be
our diversity that society at large values

483
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.960
as our most significant strength.

484
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.140
Not our ability to buy a house in the suburbs
in a prestigious school district.

485
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.740
Because while we’re busy showing how much
gay people are ‘just like’ straight people,

486
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.360
We’re forgetting about the boss-ass bitch
queers who have only ever found acceptance

487
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.910
by being better than literally everyone else.
So much so that they can’t find where their

488
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.860
performance ends and they begin.

489
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.630
The angry queers who feel like they’re only
worth something if they’re validated by

490
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:18.850
the established order, instead of finding
worth in themselves.

491
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:23.320
And the personal improvement queers who struggle
to figure out what it is they have to offer

492
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320
the world.

493
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.200
Our stories, our experiences, our lives are
interesting and relevant. And if you tell

494
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.720
an interesting story about a queer person,
audiences will cheer for them.

495
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:40.460
Which is what made me love this show. It represents
the queer community, specifically queer men,

496
00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.750
in a way that I very rarely see. And that
being... that there are many different types

497
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.140
of queer people.

498
00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.620
Insecure ones like Yuri. Perfectionists like
Victor. People who want to be center stage,

499
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.290
and people who just want to blend in. Those
of us who are comfortable in our skin, and

500
00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:01.120
those who are still working on things. Masculine
or Feminine. Supportive or Competitive. Tender

501
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:08.100
or painfully horny. We come in many different
shapes and sizes. Skin colors, religious backgrounds,

502
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.570
nationalities, and beliefs.

503
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:15.820
But at our best, like the skaters in Yuri
on Ice, we are, at the end of the day, a community.

504
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.510
There to help one another, and push each other
when we need it. So anytime you feel small

505
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:27.320
or lost or ignored… like you’re not good
enough. Like you don’t fit in. Think about

506
00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.310
the queer people who came before us. The artists.
The politicians. The power brokers. The creators.

507
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:38.580
The writers. The teachers. The brothers and
sisters. The good friends. Who changed things,

508
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.590
who told stories, who made an impact.

509
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:53.630
Because they’re important. We’re important,
we’re significant, and we were born to make

510
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.829
history.
