00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.160
this video is brought to you by
Squarespace there has arguably never

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.240
been a human civilization in history
that did not exist under the threat of

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.360
vampires in a universal context they
represent our fears of not only death

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.720
but unrest in death though it's one of
those arose By Any Other Name kind of

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.439
things where monsters we may
anthropologically recognize as vampires

6
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.920
were not the sexy murderous or twinkly
vampires we know of today Proto vampires

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.200
of the ancient world had any range of
characteristics and creation stories

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
some Proto vampires being blessed or
cursed by gods or hearkened to fears of

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.360
the unburied Dead especially looking
toward peoples in East Asia and the

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.480
indigenous people of Australia and the
Americas there was almost always some

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.480
kind of creature or Monster which
combined elements of undeath the

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.600
consumption of the living and the
shunning of the sun when we observe

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920
historic vampires we observed the fear
and what the fear was usually meant to

14
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.680
indicate usually vampiric fables served
the the utility of spooking a society

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.920
into proper burial rights and to avoid
cannibalism being unable to walk in

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.680
sunlight though that was probably more
of a symbolic gesture light specifically

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.520
the sun in almost all pre-christian and
pre-colonial societies represented the

18
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.240
highest good or capital T truth Sun gods
were usually the highest deity in a

19
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.439
given Pantheon the Ancients very quickly
recognize that especially in the context

20
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.880
of Agriculture the sun is kind of
important for almost almost everything

21
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.439
and so by the power of the sun ancient
gods allowed those great civilizations

22
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.720
to flourish so that what was outside of
the realm of what the gods considered

23
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.360
holy was associated with Darkness the
Proto vampire and by extension the

24
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.719
vampire proper was shunned from the sun
because they either represented

25
00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.200
something the public could recognize as
evil or because they had by action or

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
accident done something to earn the
God's rejection some Gods also preferred

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.560
to keep their followers in the dark
however take for instance the goddess

28
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520
Hecate she was in addition to the
helenic pantheon from Indo-European

29
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.360
migrants and in spite of the fact that
her domain of magic and the moon were

30
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.200
already covered by Artemis and Seline
she became a permanent fixture and was

31
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.680
even translated into the Roman goddess
trivia goddesses of the dark were

32
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
usually tied to the Moon an indication
that even in the night there remained a

33
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.680
Holy Light from an alternative Source
hecate's distinction was that she was

34
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.080
more closely associated with The Rustic
Gods than the proper Olympians closely

35
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.040
associated with the god pan as
occasionally a maternal figure that said

36
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.200
he enjoyed widespread and prominent
Urban worship particularly in Athens

37
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.200
really interesting goddess for both her
role in the pantheon but as well as the

38
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.400
historic movements of her myths across
the Mediterranean she also had a cult of

39
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.519
witches who ate dead babies allegedly it
should be no surprise that in helenic

40
00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.239
myth hecate's daughter empusa was the
bronze legged vampire who fed on the

41
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.280
blood of men she would seduce the
particular fear hearkens to ancient

42
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.200
gree's repulsion of a powerful
independent woman this also applies to

43
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.920
The Witches of thessaly the baby MERS of
course any woman who seeks power outside

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.040
the institutional misogyny of ancient
helis will be accused of heinous acts

45
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.400
meanwhile the first female Presidential
nominee from a major political party was

46
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.360
also accused of eating babies it's been
5,000 years guys get something original

47
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.480
for this isn't to say that the muai are
the sole progenitors of vampires but the

48
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.319
impact that a bunch of pagan homosexuals
had on shaping subsequent Millennia of

49
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.959
Christian European culture is
immeasurable it's remarkable just how

50
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.040
much of the UI is recognizable in
Victorian depictions of vampires that

51
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.159
said the values were slightly shifted
whereas the gothic writers of Europe

52
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.920
focused on depicting nocturnal Predators
the Ancients downplayed this next to

53
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.159
please don't have sex with dead things
the monotheistic colonization of Europe

54
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.000
and Africa removed competing gods and
with the god of Abraham the sole deity

55
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.360
coming to a parallel association with
the sun Europe found itself without any

56
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400
Divine protection in the night such as
Moon Gods imagery around the Christian

57
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.479
God is so quintessentially tied to
sunlight that he may as well have been

58
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.520
seen as a Sun God himself which is also
weird because by Catholic Doctrine he is

59
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.639
also a triple deity for which triple
deity ities were predominantly women

60
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.160
including Hecate herself and the Morgan
who were both associated with magic

61
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.880
magic which is considered Unholy because
of its association with the moon anyway

62
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.440
within Christian literature there is a
strong connection between God and the

63
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.080
light of day look to the fairy queen a
staple of formative English literature

64
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.360
published in 1590 an indicative of the
Norman re-evaluation of English

65
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.919
mythological sensibilities away from the
Norse and Germanic roots of the

66
00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.199
Anglo-Saxon replacing it with a
mythological cycle that is more

67
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.680
traditionally French this text makes
frequent Illusions to light and darkness

68
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.560
dark forests and Wilderness is where the
heroic Red Cross finds denisons that are

69
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.560
malevolent and who reject God and these
denzin May challenge his chivalry or

70
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.199
tempt him away from God's grace or to
Catholicism which according to the

71
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.160
anglicans was evil and while this isn't
really about vampires it does exemplify

72
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.560
the Christian affinity for holding that
the Unholy is that which exists without

73
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.319
God's light but this does apply to
vampires in a more European context for

74
00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.919
which our analysis shifts from the Proto
vampires that can be identified in most

75
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.039
historic cultures to the creatures that
come to mind with the word vampire

76
00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.440
Europe's christianization brought about
a closer association between the

77
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.919
nighttime and the Monsters of all kinds
for which even The Arcadian origins of

78
00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.360
the werewolf were used to taint the
cycles of the Moon Moon the vampire's

79
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.199
distance from the literal object of
sunlight representing the figurative

80
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.479
element of God's light was a method for
European communities and leaders to

81
00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.479
indirectly though very clearly
articulate what values they wanted to

82
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.800
highlight as evil just as the ancient
Greeks wanted to instill a culture with

83
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.880
fear of a woman seductress by plainly
associating her with the Demonic urge to

84
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.800
eat babies the European vampires
predatory nature and relegation to the

85
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.479
Shadows which were inaccessible to God
was a free license to associate all

86
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.800
things outside of the social norm and
connect it with evil it's like McCarthy

87
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.080
era how to spot a communist
instructional videos the villagers of

88
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.440
Europe would keep an eye on their Lords
and neighbors and cautionary fables of

89
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.800
the vampire would help them identify
deviant Behavior which they would then

90
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.599
report to their local Parish snitching
it's in white people's DNA the vampire

91
00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.879
became a method of exploring these
provocative desires in a coded fashion

92
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.440
however true to the hay code
resemblances these desires had to be

93
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.800
expressed in line with contemporary
European values of the day the monster

94
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.879
the sexual deviant must be brutalized
it's no surprise that many vampires are

95
00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:18.360
found out due to their lurd sexual
overtones especially as they became

96
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.360
increasingly connected to a kind of
extravagant sexual predator who exists

97
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.440
in opulence and lavishness vampires came
to represent the urban Predator compared

98
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.840
to the werewolves and ghosts of the
countryside so naturally vampires are

99
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.599
from an anthropological Viewpoint an
excellent symbol of a society's

100
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.520
Collective fears of who exactly is an
other for the helenic it was the Single

101
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.680
Ladies within the public Circles of the
1700s and onwards regardless of what was

102
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.960
going on in the manners of the wealthy
there was an intense public fear of

103
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.759
sexuality and as would develop
throughout the 1800s an intense push for

104
00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:01.240
Conformity to heteronormative sexual
standards and gender roles which was

105
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.599
when the vampire had its greatest Heyday
in storytelling and became a staple of

106
00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:12.000
Gothic literature and folklore alike at
least until now but before we sink our

107
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.840
teeth into the soft flesh of that let's

Squarespace

127
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.519
somehow we ended up with what we do in
the shadows well the series which is

128
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:30.839
what is under discussion today was
originally a companion spin-off to the

129
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.800
New Zealand independent film by Tao with
Titi it has likely since eclipsed the

130
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.040
original content both in the range of
Side characters settings and World

131
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.160
building but also in terms of how
strongly this improv based comedy series

132
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.240
has endured Five Seasons without any
sign of slowing down but what makes this

133
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.040
series so important to vampires like me
well sure it plays off a bunch of

134
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.519
vampire Aesthetics and traits which
point out how incoherent the collective

135
00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:06.600
vampire Mythos is somehow it all finds a
way into this comedic parody and the

136
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.800
absurdity of it all just adds to the
comedy making these real people who

137
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.480
areound by certain vampiric

138
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.160
rules do you think maybe you could let
me into your shelter of

139
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160
automobiles what oh yeah come on in of
course and yes as the series goes on

140
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.360
it's been confirmed that each one of the
main characters is some varant an

141
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.959
intensity of queer not that it really
needed to be confirmed but it's nice to

142
00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.680
have these outspoken queer characters
who are queer without being preachy but

143
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.200
Thea make sure that they remember the
part about me telling them that I'm gay

144
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.360
so I mean who isn't gay a lot of people
oh okay woohoo I'll get the trumpets out

145
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.040
sorry however what we do vampires marks
a titular turning point in how our

146
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.680
culture has come to understand vampires
a precipice that has been thousands of

147
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.800
years in the making and this comes down
to how the show frames and displays

148
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.680
these vampires the series is a
documentary style comedy featuring

149
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.519
frequent cutaways confessional segments
where the vampires address the audience

150
00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:13.760
directly in order to offer additional
elaboration on either elements of the

151
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.360
show or how the history of vampiric
folklore manifests in the modern day

152
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.279
half the bats you see they are just
vampires that have thrown terrible ories

153
00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:26.560
and they are too ashamed to regain their
vampire form so they just split around

154
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.000
shame bats bats full of Shame game the
general premise of the show is a little

155
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.279
bit more laxed than the movie the series
does have the overarching plot line of

156
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:39.240
Gamo saying can I has vampire aside from
that the show is about a collection of

157
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.880
Roommates who are struggling with the
drags of eternal life in modern America

158
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.000
each of these roommates can be seen as a
typification of the various sub genres

159
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.880
of vampires with a couple of recurring
characters filling in the gaps the

160
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.000
comedic sensibilities come from a gross
defamiliarization and demystification of

161
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.880
the vampire Mythic itself what do we do
in the shadows more or less what normal

162
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.600
people do but with a dash of chaotic
anachronisms I didn't know it would be

163
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:16.240
full of curses all we need to do is send
that to 10 friends or foes by samr and

164
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.320
the curse will be lifted where are we
going to get the email addresses the

165
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.360
email address shop first there's nandor
who is indicative of the kind of Vlad

166
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.240
tepus vampire which though he may have
been a distant inspiration for Count

167
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.560
Dracula reconnecting Dracula to the
warrior mythology wasn't something that

168
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.959
would be done until Francis Ford cop's
incredibly faithful retelling of the

169
00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:39.720
story nandor The Relentless is a former
warlord of the fictional nation of

170
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.800
alanar kaven noak's portrayal of an
Impaler inspired vampire becomes a

171
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.560
commentary on the kind of person who
peaked at 17 when he scored a winning

172
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.160
touchdown and took his team to State
knowing that he can't relive The Glory

173
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.519
Days he struggles to find ways to feel
meaningful he knows he wants to do

174
00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:02.759
something something important but he
doesn't really know what that is or how

175
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:07.440
to apply himself to the modern world in
order of who the gays are in a frenzy

176
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.560
over there's Naja Natasia dimitrio takes
on a more generalized take on the

177
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.600
Vampire Queen perhaps most clearly
drawing from the vampirus progenitor

178
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.839
Camilla Nao is also the title of the
1994 horror film about the daughter of

179
00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:25.959
Count Dracula FYI the more you know this
is not that najer though who was born in

180

an impoverished Village on the Greek
island of anti pxa NAA is driven

the household fearing only her sire the
baron ofas Darth Vader doesn't have [ __ ]

183
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:44.839

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:57.839
lets on Demetrio balances naja's
Incredible strength with the exact kind

187
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:01.320
of character FLA that most a type
personalities suffer from being a

188
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.120
complete hot [ __ ] mess something is
going very pits up with my life a third

189
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.360
housemate is playing off a lesser known
vampiric Tale the psychic vampire Colin

190
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.680
Robinson as such a vampire feeds off of
the Life Energy of someone rather than

191
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.720
waving his hands and using magic to
drain their life from someone Colin

192
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.680
Robinson feeds off of their heightened
emotions or just general annoyance he

193
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.360
goes about talking about random
information dumps that are tangentially

194
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.279
related to the topic at hand or by doing
naturally irritating things Colin

195
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:35.040
Robinson seems to be a one note
character at first from his introduction

196
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.600
though the show makes quick work of
highlighting just the level of absurdity

197
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.720
that this character offers to the show
less an allegory of an actual kind of

198
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.160
vampire and more so a comedic play about
a certain kind of person

199
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.759
TGIF it's 5:00
somewhere

200
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.959
D working hard or hardly work
we all know one if you know more than

201
00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:06.920
two Canadians chances are you know an
energy vampire who do you think runs the

202
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.600
parliament Colin Robinson is a sheer
contrast to normal vampires like me who

203
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.759
Pride themselves on how interesting they
are to a psychic vampire being

204
00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:21.880
interesting is detrimental to their
ability to feed says here that I am

205
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:28.160
100% white Colin Robinson is gray and
beige preferring Cardigans and sweater

206
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.360
vests where the others Dawn extravagant
gowns lavish multi-piece suit ensembles

207
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.079
and cir coats however it's not just
husband who is worth discussion for this

208
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:44.000
context llo cravensworth he is probably
the most memeable character of the show

209
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.680
if for no other reason than some very
strategic line deliveries it took

210
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.440
everyone a few episodes to really get
going but Matt Barry showed up on set

211
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.319
and had his character locked and loaded
from the very beginning the only Harry

212
00:16:56.319 --> 00:17:00.560
frog I'm interested in my darling is the
one between your legs it's not just a

213
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.959
frog it's the whole swamp true if nandor
is indicative of a vampiric folk tale of

214
00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:12.480
a reclusive cruel Baron and najja is the
Victorian vampiric seductress llo is a

215
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.520
satirical reflection of a vampire of the
late 20th century capturing the raw

216
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.520
excessive sensuality of an Rice's
vampires and those who she later

217
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.000
inspired but not the sparkly ones llo
has an extreme Comfort around sex that

218
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.960
would shock the public facade of any
British lawmaker of the 1800s or today

219
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.559
granted for their day job they'd
conveniently forget about the sexual

220
00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:37.280
depravity that took part in the West End
the other vampires have their Ambitions

221
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.799
and objectives and Grand designs llo by
contrast seems entirely content with

222
00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:47.360
where he is perfectly happy to spend his
days engaging not only in lurd act

223
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.720
varying intensities but bearing no
discrimination to any of it he also

224
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.559
partakes in any manner of art and
culture granted all the vampires are

225
00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:59.000
very open about their sexuality and
sexual attractions so some of my wives

226
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.559
were good wives some of them were guy
wives it's not that different llo is the

227
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:10.679
sexual deviant the victorians feared so
deeply meanwhile he's the most harmless

228
00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:15.600
of the group the most likely to form
human friendships and who seems to have

229
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.159
the lowest body count save for Colin
Robinson who does not need to kill his

230
00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:24.720
victims to feed off of them though death
might be preferable in fact The Ensemble

231
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.600
of characters and the fact that it's
popular enough to assume that the

232
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.919
largest WTH of the rep public gets it
seems to indicate a shift not towards

233
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:40.280
how we think of vampires as a culture
but a shift in our very culture itself

234
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.000
vampires which were once decried as
monsters to whom social devians was

235
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.159
compared to a kind of cosmic treason
against the light of God are now

236
00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:53.480
accepted as people with whom many of us
could see ourselves being friendly

237
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.600
regardless what we do in the shadow
seems to represent a most recent step in

238
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600
our society dissemination of vampires
and not only what they mean to us but to

239
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.760
gauge the moral value that is placed on
the values that vampires represent

240
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.520
however with what we do in the shadows
seeming to typify so many vampire tropes

241
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.320
and reflect upon us our shifting
Evolution on the evaluation of these

242
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.280
social elements did these progenitors
actually carry this weight and what were

243
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.400
exactly the original progenitors of
these roommates to understand what these

244
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.559
vampires represent to our society we
first need to understand what those

245
00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:39.280
vampires meant to

246
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.640
theirs the vampire enjoyed a period of
relative anonymity between Antiquity and

247
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.200
the Industrial Revolution being
creatures tied to Pagan deities they

248
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.400
fell to the Wayside in Lee of more
generalized Revenant zombies however

249
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.799
there were a large number of reported
vampire sightings in the 1700s coming

250
00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:03.000
from the area of the Balan Peninsula
it's difficult to really gauge what

251
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.200
vampires meant to prearo Europeans
because the bulk of European fears were

252
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.640
attached to Witchcraft maybe Hecate and
her Single Ladies weren't on sabatical

253
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.720
after all however in light of
superstition migrating across Europe

254
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.760
with a flood of Eastern European
immigrants vampires very suddenly and

255
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.320
very quickly took the common folk by the
throat at the time there was a dualistic

256
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.240
fascination with Slavic culture that
came in tandem with the fear of those

257
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.120
foreign values passing into proper
European Society coupled of course with

258
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.120
a very Victorian fear of what they
described as social Decay whatever that

259
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.400
meant something about foundational
European values being abandoned for

260
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.760
radical new ideas which may have been at
the time code for being afraid of

261
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.480
immigrants but England has surely
shaking off that by now because the

262
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.880
Americas are any better and you know in
light of that perhaps the reason white

263
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.600
people people are so terrified of
immigrant cultures quote unquote

264
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.480
invading is because we subconsciously
are aware that it's exactly what we

265
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:13.320
white people did when we immigrated to
America maybe at any rate in perhaps in

266
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.120
line with this social Decay was a
growing trend of Rockstar poets who

267
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.000
wanted to write about sex but still
wanted to keep up Airs of being a

268
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.159
respectable gentleman in order to avert
censorship and Scandal they wrote this

269
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:29.960
subject of sexual Fascination into their
villains it's nothing short of

270
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.240
hypocritical that Lord Byron wrote of
empiric villain who fed on blood and

271
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.679
Chastity coincidental of course that he
himself was likened to a vampire by one

272
00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:43.520
of his gay exes no less while the
vampire existed in poetry before then

273
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.120
Lord Byron's former personal physician
John palador published a short work of

274
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.080
Pros fiction in 1819 called the vampire
with a Y which also looking into it

275
00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.279
there was like 12 poems called called
The Vampire before then palador was just

276
00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:03.880
the first to set it to pros and the
first which specifically painted the

277
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.279
vampire as making his hunting ground out
to be the social Elite by masquerading

278
00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:12.559
as one of them himself no longer semi-d
demonic cave dwellers roving the

279
00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:17.159
countryside nor the reclusive occupants
of seemingly deserted manners and forts

280
00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:20.400
there was only a brief transition
between the vampire of Southeastern

281
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.240
Europe and the High rolling lady killer
of palador palador vampire is Lord

282
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.760
rathen whose reputation in English High
Society warrants caution though the

283
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.919
novel's protagonist John I
mean Aubrey instigates himself with him

284
00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:39.559
nevertheless Aubry is drawn to ruin on
an almost Supernatural level and while

285
00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:44.320
he never is particularly threatened by
ruen he overlooks an apparent Darkness

286
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.400
Ruan and Aubrey go on a tour of Europe
as was a common Coming of Age ritual for

287
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.640
young affluent men of the day much in
the same way the palador and Byron found

288
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.240
themselves in a cottage on Lake Geneva
with Mary and Percy Shelly a famous late

289
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.279
spring trip which is cited as being the
conception for Frankenstein granted the

290
00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:06.679
same-sex attraction between Ruan and
Aubry is

291
00:23:06.679 --> 00:23:11.320
subtext but not really palador had to be
careful not to OD himself publicly or he

292
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.360
would suffer the same backlash that
Byron often received granted this was a

293
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.159
day and age where sexual perversion of
all kinds including gross heterosexual

294
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:23.960
promiscuity was on the same level as
buggery provided more research I would

295
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.960
like to see if people of the day just
took it for granted that a vampire Prov

296
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.799
ided promiscuity would also imply an
extension of sexual appetites to

297
00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:37.760
same-sex desire as a piece of evidence
look to another and perhaps more

298
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.120
significant work of vampiric fiction
carmilla by Irish author Sheridan lafu

299
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.039
unlike palador there isn't really any
information to suggest that lafu engaged

300
00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:52.240
in queerness in his own personal life
though his expression of same-sex desire

301
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.880
among women is more Stark than among
Camila's

302
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.440
vampers there may be a few reasons for
this inclusion perhaps because it was

303
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.520
European custom to tolerate close if not
intimate friendships Between Women

304
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.159
alternatively because in line with an
80s slasher movie reserving the most

305
00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:13.120
brutal deaths for those committing
premarital sex Carmela herself is

306
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.480
brutalized in a way that was not
reserved for any vampires until Breaking

307
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.480
Dawn part two while it can be said that
the work is sympathetic to queer people

308
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.600
and that queerness itself is not the
element that is punished it can

309
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.440
alternately be observed that punishment
is reserved for the sexual aggressor in

310
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.679
order to protect Laura who represents
the naive delicate feminine

311
00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:38.520
sensibilities that the victorians
praised so much the female vampire is

312
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.559
the ultimate predator and a staunched
challenger of the patriarchal order her

313
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:47.760
Allure her very presence poses a direct
threat as she seeks to penetrate her

314
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.880
male victims yet Carmela she operates
quite differently from the female

315
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.720
vampires we encounter in the tale of
Dracula later on you see Carmela Harbors

316
00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.279
no desire for men when the vampire is a
lesbian she transforms into a harbinger

317
00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:04.440
of Destruction targeting her fellow
women and subtly undermining the

318
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.520
foundations of heteronormative masculine
dominance Carmela presents the most

319
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.559
formidable challenge to the Norms of
heteronormativity due to her profound

320
00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:16.880
desire for women and her steadfast
rejection of the patriarchal power

321
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.120
structure for her crime of Grand Theft
lesbian her hunters for she is hunted

322
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.120
first drive a stake through Carmela's
heart then decapitate her and finally

323
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.120
cremate her head and body upon a funeral
p and then they meticulously collect

324
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.200
every last trace of her ashes and
scatter them over a nearby River

325
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.880
ensuring that there is no possibility of
carmilla's remains reconstituting and

326
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.640
reanimating this procedure leaves no
room for doubt about Carmelo's final

327
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.080
demise Overkill much the link between
vampires and queerness was related

328
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.480
seemingly in so far as vampires
represented all manner of sexual

329
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.880
deviants though I can't help given the
volume of queer writers who seem to be

330
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.279
drawn to the vampire thinking that even
if just to read their ex's perhaps there

331
00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:07.840
is something more to this I question
whether there was a portion of the

332
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.679
vampiric Mythos that functioned as a
beacon as if by some kind of code

333
00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:15.000
vampires were symbols that
non-conformists could signal to one

334
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.520
another through their public masquerade
as monsters others within Society who

335
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.440
themselves were often compared to
monsters could be drawn towards like

336
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.440
minded spaces and through the Squall of
homophobic and quite frankly sex phobic

337
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.679
social conditioning the presence of this
violent myth presented a Gateway for the

338
00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:37.679
imprudent to seek out one another among
the most significant elements of this

339
00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:43.039
pattern
actually occurred in

340
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.799
1976 of course it was in godamn San
Francisco granted Interview with a

341
00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:55.760
Vampire and an Rice have been under
discussion previously on this channel

342
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.399
whereas once needed to be vigilant of
vampire for their prowess over seduction

343
00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:03.080
how would this pivotal component of
vampires manifest during the sexual

344
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.240
Revolution anr's Vamps are pivotal for
representing a shift in vampiric

345
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.760
perspectives this new vampire Louie sat
down for an interview once upon a time

346
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.640
and changed how we all thought of
vampires forever while vampires had been

347
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.200
sexual an rice was among the first to
make them sexy while Interview with the

348
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.960
Vampire was not an initial success
Chelsea Quin yarro St Germaine series of

349
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.120
central Romance Books began in
1978 and endured until 2014 Quinn being

350
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.240
a woman living near the San Francisco
Bay area of the 70s and writing about a

351
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.120
sensual French immigrant vampire in New

352
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.039
Orleans I guess Rice's vampires
specifically stood out because of her

353
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:51.120
focus on their beauty specifically larts
indeed when we first encounter lart

354
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.120
through the fevered lens of Louie who's
very depressed his depiction Bears an

355
00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.840
uncanny resemblance to Lord 's portrayal
of Camila lat is described as fair

356
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.360
skinned possessing a graceful almost
feline quality in his movements and he's

357
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.320
even liken to an angel a far cry from
the beings distant from God's light

358
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.880
though granted the vampire had been
renowned to shroud itself in a curtain

359
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.080
of perceived piety another departure
from vampiric traditionalism is Rice's

360
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.679
insistence on the ritual to become a
vampire no longer can a vampire just

361
00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:27.320
bite you and turn you into one quite
frankly it was never quite that clear

362
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.960
when a vampire bit to kill and when to
spread the curse it was all very

363
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.240
confusing with rice the vampiric
candidate must participate in the ritual

364
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.159
by consuming the blood of their sire and
while this speaks to a kind of mandate

365
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:43.720
for reciprocal consent it fits better
with the Victorian perspective on the

366
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.440
curse an individual who is forced into
vampirism is tragic and empathetic

367
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.039
though depicting each vampire as an
active participant in their own downfall

368
00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:57.360
is what you get the tortures and
pitchforks for some Poetic Justice and

369
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.679
and make no mistake rice makes a point
of exemplifying that vampires without a

370
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:07.200
pulse cannot develop an erection however
feeding on one another is unmistakably

371
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.440
depicted as a sex act during the titular
interview Louie recounts I drank sucking

372
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.600
the blood out of the wounds experiencing
for the first time since infancy the

373
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.640
unique pleasure of drawing nourishment
the body wholly attune to the mind's

374
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.919
focus on a single vital Source oh yes
normal fatio wi seeing how the two

375
00:29:28.919 --> 00:29:33.399
mysterious inaccessible handsome wealthy
bachelors in New Orleans suddenly find

376
00:29:33.399 --> 00:29:37.720
themselves raising a forever child this
is unmistakably a queer allegory and for

377
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.960
anyone who had any lingering doubts we
have the recent television series

378
00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:55.679
where

379
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.279
my my
yes vampires that [ __ ] AMC's rendition

380
00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:06.000
of Interview with the Vampire is a
modern unflinchingly maab and

381
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.279
delightfully sexual reimagining of the
tale what was once subtext concerning

382
00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:14.279
gay themes now stands boldly in the
foreground like a hardon painting the

383
00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:18.159
picture of a dashing vampire in search
of more than just transient

384
00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:22.720
companionship when lat de Leon cor
Whispers to Louis de Ponto about

385
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.840
Desiring an eternal counterpart it's
evident that he's not in the market for

386
00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.960
just a FL mate this Immortal sanguinary
Duo is intriguingly queer identifying as

387
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.600
such and their interactions are not just
charged but are undeniably intense

388
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.840
passionate and occasionally interspersed
with the Crimson fluid of Life their

389
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.320
existence Beyond The vampiric Thirst
challenges the very fabric of human

390
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.519
convention interview gracefully dances
through a profound narrative

391
00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:57.760
intertwining the complexities of
sexuality race identity dominance

392
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.639
and societal suppression through this
lens it underscores the history of

393
00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:05.760
America and the constraints it has
placed on these magnificently queer

394
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.799
vampires forcing them into a dance of
audacious queerness and a myriad of

395
00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:15.159
misdeeds in a way the concept of gay
vampires is intellectually appetizing

396
00:31:15.159 --> 00:31:20.760
with eons at their disposal surely these
Immortal beings would indulge experiment

397
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.320
and embrace the fluidity of their
desires lat in his Grandeur perceives

398
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:32.519
vampires as beings Transcendent of mere
humans consequently they are unfettered

399
00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:38.519
by the petty prejudices and insecurities
that plague mankind to them Concepts

400
00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:44.200
like racism sexism and homophobia are
trivial for Humanity itself is deemed

401
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.120
inconsequential as a mortal Lou's queer
identity albeit concealed combined with

402
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.639
being black in a very racist America
relegates him to society's periphery lat

403
00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:58.279
with his telepathic Lamentations
frequently underscores was the ignorance

404
00:31:58.279 --> 00:32:02.639
and inelegance of racist humans who
demean Louie for the color of his skin

405
00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:07.240
till a start the real grotesquery lies
within typical men in the realm of the

406
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.480
undead Louie is Unshackled from
Mankind's oppressive decrees no longer

407
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.080
ens snared by societal bindings and
racist overtones of the era in the tale

408
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.120
wo in an interview no narrator stands
unquestionably credible however Daniel

409
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.000
Lou's biographer and wrapped listener
casts a critical eye on Lou account

410
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.120
through Daniel's lens Lou emerges as a
vulnerable victim ens snared by a

411
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.720
manipulative creature endowed with a
myriad of captivating Powers many

412
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.720
meticulously honed for seduction Daniel
perceives Louie as tragically naive and

413
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.480
snared in a dance with lart that
embodies the essence of predator and

414
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.080
prey a dynamic punctuated by a
staggering Chasm of power in a poignant

415
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.159
exchange when Loui confides in Daniel
suggesting that his entanglement with

416
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:57.600
lart was both mutual and equitably
poised

417
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.039
Daniel retorts with a biting to the
shame of queer theorists everywhere I

418
00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:08.159
got in that coffin of my own free
will in the quiet

419
00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:13.440
dark we were equals in Daniel's
discernment intertwining Notions of

420
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.320
dominance vampirism mortality and the
shadow of death with the threads of

421
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.200
queerness and passion is at best jarring
juxtaposition if not profoundly

422
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.240
derogatory white Master black student
but equal in the quiet dark while

423
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.960
Daniel's perspective isn't devoid of
validity it stems from an external

424
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.480
Viewpoint he lacks the intimate
experiences that molded Louie Daniel has

425
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.679
never grappled with the complexities of
being gay he doesn't carry the weight of

426
00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:45.960
being a person of color and despite
Louis's vivid descriptions the depths of

427
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.240
Despair and vulnerability felt by a
black queer man in the clutches of Jim

Crow era South elude Daniel's grasp
observing The Narrative unfold and

429
00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:59.639
immersing oneself in Louis Journey
offers a window into his psyche

430
00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:04.840
Illuminating his motivations and choices
throughout the first season we saw why

431
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.359
he was drawn to lat and why he thought
he could never leave him that intimacy

432
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:14.280
might never be replaced but he takes his
chances eventually while sex and

433
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.639
intimacy are inextricably linked to
queer identity so too are power and

434
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:24.839
Rebellion queerness represents
resilience in a realm that often wishes

435
00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:30.079
your existence away inter view
intensifies this struggle just opposing

436
00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:34.280
the supernatural with the societal it
brings into sharp Focus the world's

437
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.800
potential for harm and the sheer will it
demands to thrive within it perhaps

438
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.280
being a gay vampire engaged in nefarious
activities isn't optimal yet it offers

439
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.599
Louis a truer reflection of himself far
more than the Mortal realm ever could in

440
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:55.879
Interview with the Vampire the book the
movie and now the TV show we witnessed

441
00:34:55.879 --> 00:35:00.000
the Inception of a trans formative era
for vampire literature and the vampire

442
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.119
archetype in the 21st century lat Louie
and Arman the central characters of the

443
00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:09.839
ongoing vampire Chronicles emerge as
queer vampires who rice and her literary

444
00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:14.200
descendants employ to break free of the
cycle of functioning as a cautionary

445
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.359
tale as luck would have it there is a
measurable element of tracking Rice's

446
00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:25.000
impact on the public perception and
expectation of vampires and that being

447
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.800
how we went from this

448
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.680
to
this see

449
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:42.920
me see me
now Dracula no this wasn't an Omission

450
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.640
because it's been done and analyzed to
death but tracking the progress and

451
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.560
development of vampires in the last 200
years as per the extra canonical

452
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.760
depictions of the count particularly in
the context of whether or not they're

453
00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:01.920
serving goosi B but busy is just busy is
something we can do here because for all

454
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.520
the plethora versions of Dracula several
of these variations penned by Bram

455
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.520
Stoker himself Francis Ford copel as
Bram Stoker's Dracula henceforth

456
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.920
referred to as cop's Dracula to avoid
confusion was a unique furry Awakening I

457
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.839
mean a unique sensual depiction of this
titular Transylvanian recluse even in

458
00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:24.599
the book Dracula is never as explicitly
seductive as he is with Gary Oldman and

459
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.680
wiona Ryder ey [ __ ] each other on the
orian streets of England Bram Stoker

460
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.800
himself was arguably gay and the figure
of Dracula was inspired by an

461
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.800
emotionally distant employer of his and
while it is widely accepted that there

462
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.200
is an abundance of subtext to be read
into the exchanges of Jonathan Harker

463
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.920
and Count Dracula the film does not
elaborate on

464
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:53.440
them
mostly fun fact that was improvised Gary

465
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.160
Oldman was chronically Sauced on set and
it was scripted that Dracula had cut

466
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.000
Hawker Gary just went and licked it up
and ended up slicing his tongue open in

467
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.680
the process meanwhile that's the most
unsettling shot in the entire movie not

468
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.680
the most memorable because other
elements of the book that had either

469
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.079
been subtext or alluded to are included
yes Lucy is a bit of a [ __ ] and we love

470
00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:19.599
her for that though I'm grateful that
stoker framed her death as not a

471
00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:24.280
punishment for her promiscuity but as a
tragic turn of someone malevolently

472
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.160
exploiting her for it Dracula's more
Fant fantastic Powers such as his shape

473
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.240
shifting are plainly depicted Stoker's
Illusions to Vlad the Impaler are

474
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.040
confirmed and Copa expands on the
relationship between Dracula and Mina

475
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.800
inserting a subplot around the long
forlorn Romance the novel itself was a

476
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.160
little bit subversive aside from Jona
ship name and the band of vampire

477
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.359
Hunters being too gay to function most
notably among them the Texan I mean if

478
00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:55.319
your name is Quincy then you can blame
your parents for your homosexuality

479
00:37:55.319 --> 00:37:58.960
however it stands out from other
Adventure literature of the time that

480
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:05.680
only one of the group to make any
Headway is a woman Mina For Whom the men

481
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.599
in the cast chronically fuss over her
delicate feminine sensibilities Copa

482
00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:13.280
also includes stronger religious
overtones to boot again the significant

483
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.000
element here is how readily Copa depicts
a Dracula who [ __ ] whereas Dracula has

484
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.640
been more prominently depicted as a
reclusive humanoid monster from

485
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.040
nuratu plan nine from outer space
Salem's Lot the last voice voage of the

486
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.280
demer this figure has almost exclusively
been painted white and shown with

487
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.680
clownishly monstrous features but Copa
creates a monster For Whom the audience

488
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.839
looks at and completely understands what
Mina is so horny about perhaps due to

489
00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:47.200
Dracula's capacity to shift forms
between beautiful and hideous man and

490
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.440
wolf Copa is depicting a visile range of
duplicity the vampire's speciality and

491
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.720
that wouldn't be an inaccurate reading
were it not for the fact that Mina's

492
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.520
feelings for him persist even as she
sees him at his most monstrous coupled

493
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.920
with the fact that cop's Dracula depicts
him as a tragic figure whose shunning of

494
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.200
God's light was spurned by a broken
heart and then turned to Vengeance that

495
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.720
draws him closer to Rice's influence
however a lot happened between cop's

496
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:21.000
Dracula and the recent television
depiction of Lou lat Armand and Claudia

497
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.280
which beckons the
question what happened with that

498
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.440
Stephanie Meer thing

499
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:36.000
okay sure the vampires were sparkly for
some reason apparently there was a scene

500
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.240
from the book Maya saw in a dream where
Edward was sparkling in the Sun and she

501
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.480
built the whole damn story around that
for some reason that just

502
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:53.000
screamed vampire to her I guess and sure
St and patson rubbed a lot of hopeful

503
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.119
actors the wrong way for how quick they
were to mock can insult the franchise

504
00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:04.119
that gave them careers however between
them and Taylor LNO who's getting work

505
00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:08.040
in Oscar nominations these days and we
could talk about Twilight and why it

506
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.880
sucks but we need to protect our mental
health we can analyze it to death and

507
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.640
because of a Mormon riter evoking
imagery of a teenager who has sex once

508
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.119
gets pregnant and almost dies because of
it but I I swear I I've done this

509
00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:28.720
before I've talked about this
before have I so if rice made vampires

510
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.040
sexy Maya seemed to make
them romantic I don't even know what to

511
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.040
call them because the degree to which
the central romance exhibits abusive

512
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.640
traits is unsettling to killing stalking
proportions romantic is probably a good

513
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.720
word if for no other reason than
describing the way Edward and his Undead

514
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.880
supermodel friends were intended to be
seen they are certainly romance novel

515
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.440
cover boys what was the cause for this
craze in our culture though and how did

516
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.839
this affect the vampire Mythos to answer
the second question first it it didn't

517
00:40:58.839 --> 00:41:03.319
have any effect at least not in the long
term though at the time Twilight sees

518
00:41:03.319 --> 00:41:07.599
the endrin systems of teenage girls like
nothing else the fervor for this book

519
00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:12.280
series was at a fever pitch of intensity
we haven't seen since and was not

520
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.319
dissimilar to that wizard book which is
our Sean Steelers they use it to make

521
00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:20.400
magnets even before the movies Twilight
generated a veritable Pacific trash

522
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.599
island of merchandise revolving around
the team Edward Team Jacob love triangle

523
00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:29.319
Twilight's weird popularity coincided
with an incredibly weird point in

524
00:41:29.319 --> 00:41:33.920
history and it's very consequentially
American see America is a magical place

525
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.000
where roughly every eight years the
culture economy and national identity

526
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.800
shifts in radical ways and nobody knows
why well we do it seems that for some

527
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.440
reason the president of the United
States and the values of him and his

528
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.720
cohorts have a profound effects on
Shifting the inherent sensibilities of

529
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.319
the people of the nation at large and
this is very clearly exemplified by the

530
00:41:56.319 --> 00:42:00.680
the transition of power from the Clinton
Administration to the Bush

531
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.079
Administration Bill Clinton may have
made some empty promises to the queer

532
00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:10.520
Community Lots however there was a
building momentum towards rights

533
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.720
development and then George Bush
committed voter fraud in Florida and

534
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.440
suddenly PTA groups that had once been
developing a comfort with gay friends

535
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.760
and neighbors under Clinton those same
people decided that perhaps a gay gym

536
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.480
teacher or scout leader were a threat to
their

537
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.040
children Bush's America is the first
right-wing Evangelical president was

538
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.440
rooted heavily in purity-based
values one thing that mystifies me about

539
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.760
people living in America is how they
can't see that even if the president

540
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.640
does not explicitly make something part
of their political agenda it somehow

541
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.280
ends up coming down into the whole
culture for a Whole Decade in this case

542
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.440
a very loud discourse around pushing for
abstinence only sexual education in

543
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.800
schools not only that but projecting
those Purity standards to adults as well

544
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.280
reeling back from The Echoes of the
sexual Revolution that were redeveloping

545
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.160
in the 1990s bushes America turned in
the opposite direction

546
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.400
weirdly this would have been R for a
reinvention of ye old Victorian vampires

547
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.000
where sex is bad and vampires are bad
because they have sex however this

548
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.839
wouldn't be possible because an Rice's
vampire Chronicles has since become a

549
00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:42.240
global sensation for depicting vampires
as tragic misunderstood and empathetic

550
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.559
anti-heroes in conjunction the 1994 film
adaptation was still a game Cher for the

551
00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:52.559
careers of Brad Pit Tom Cruz and Kiron
Dunst even if an rice had at the time

552
00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:57.319
renounced the darkness and began a brief
foyer back into Catholicism though that

553
00:43:57.319 --> 00:44:01.200
didn't last long vampires in so far as
they were able to be fully developed

554
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.319
characters could not be exclusively
villainous anymore so Twilight hit a

555
00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:09.599
peak of popularity when it appealed to
the darker edio fantasies of teenagers

556
00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:12.960
while at the same time having a
presentation that the Purity Brigade

557
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.240
would give a stamp of approval to
Twilight could maintain the illusion of

558
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.160
sexuality without engaging with it in a
meaningful way however for this reason

559
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.760
Meer divorced herself from the core
philosophy of vampires which only begins

560
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.839
at the sparkling thing in the X-Men
powers that dominate the latter half of

561
00:44:30.839 --> 00:44:35.200
the series vampires as we can identify
them traditionally Focus around sexual

562
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.480
Liberation for which the author and
Society May moralize that as good or bad

563
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.119
and because Myers Mormon vampires I feel
like that needs to be an episode of what

564
00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.520
we do in the shadows Mormon vampires
come knocking on your door are divorced

565
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.200
from sex they are divorced from sexual
deviancy which as per creative license

566
00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.640
isn't a bad thing what's puzzling to me
is why the public chose to accept this

567
00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.160
depiction of vampires that was so far
removed from identifiable depictions for

568
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.480
unfortunately these narrative decisions
pushed queer people further out of the

569
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.440
genre that we very much built as
creators and subjects which was also a

570
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.839
strong component of Bush's personal
belief system which he desperately tried

571
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:23.040
to turn into policy no gaze how boring
for which institutional discrimination

572
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.280
was the principal topic for True Blood
based on the southern vampire Mysteries

573
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.839
True Blood in the least Tolan way
possible turned vampires into onetoone

574
00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:35.359
allegories for the queer community at
its core True Blood was more than just a

575
00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:39.920
vampire drama it was a powerful platform
that explored societal prejudices civil

576
00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.640
rights and the intricacies of identity
in a way that resonated deeply with the

577
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.640
queer Community not just because of the
hot men from the onset True Blood used

578
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.119
phrases like coming out of the coffin
for vampires revealing their existence

579
00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:56.040
to humans mirrored in the real world
experience of coming out the vampires

580
00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.240
fight for civil rights recognition and
acceptance in human society is

581
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.280
reminiscent of the real world struggles
faced by the queer Community this

582
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.040
allegory made the vampires cause
relatable and provided a unique

583
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.720
perspective on societal prejudices and
the fight for equality the cultural

584
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.720
nature of the series allowed for an
exploration of sexuality that goes

585
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.720
beyond traditional binaries several
characters including some vampires

586
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.640
demonstrate fluid sexual preferences
this fluidity in True Blood reflects the

587
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.000
evolving understanding of sexuality in
our real world where labels become less

588
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.160
rigid and more people acknowledge the
spectrum of sexual orientations True

589
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.599
Blood walks so Elite could dimensionally
transcend it's porn with cinematography

590
00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:45.440
a running theme in the series is the
fear of that which is different or

591
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.319
misunderstood the animosity many humans
feel toward vampires and True Blood is

592
00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:55.000
not dissimilar to the fear or distrust
some individuals Harbor toward the queer

593
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.720
Community to this this day The
Fellowship of the Sun an extremist

594
00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.160
anti-vampire Church in the series
provides a Critical examination of how

595
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.760
religion can be weaponized against
marginalized groups the church's zealous

596
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.640
Crusade against vampires draws a
parallel to the real world religious

597
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:16.480
entities that condemn and persecute
lgbtq plus individuals based on dogmatic

598
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.880
beliefs throughout True Blood vampires
rally for the V the vampire Rights

599
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.040
Amendment which would grant them equal
rights as humans this political backdrop

600
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.040
mirrors the very real battle for queer
rights from Marriage equality to

601
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.240
anti-discrimination laws the series
juxtaposes The visceral emotions of the

602
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.040
vampire characters with these political
movements emphasizing the human or

603
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.640
vampire faces behind the issues for many
characters their journey in the series

604
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.119
is one of self-acceptance just as Jason
Stackhouse grapples with his attraction

605
00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:52.880
to vampires perhaps even male ones or
terara thoron comes to terms with her

606
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.480
own sexuality many queer individuals
wrestle with with internalized

607
00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.319
prejudices before they can fully accept
themselves these let's say fictional

608
00:48:01.319 --> 00:48:06.200
characters and creatures say a lot about
our society especially those considered

609
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.359
the least Among Us from the monsters of
Y to the dangerous foreigners of the 17

610
00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:17.160
and 1800s to the sexual predators of the
1900s and then the Sparkles and civil

611
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.559
rights allegories of the 2000s but what
does it say about our

612
00:48:21.559 --> 00:48:24.559
society

613
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.640
today

614
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:33.280
the mass acceptance of the Staten Island
vampires signal more than just a

615
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.240
spiritual victory of the rights fights
shown in True Blood but rather an

616
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.720
indication that in spite of widespread
political and institutional persecution

617
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.680
we seem to be finding acceptance on a
societal level that we did not have

618
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.920
before we meaning queer people but also
we meaning the sex positive earlier

619
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.799
queer leaders in the 60s and 70s sought
to use the sexual Revolution to justify

620
00:48:57.799 --> 00:49:02.319
the advancement of queer rights if the
stigma is removed from sex itself then

621
00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:06.799
there is little ground for persecuting
one for whom they have sex with consent

622
00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:10.680
provided of course the victorians would
not see the comedy and what we do in the

623
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.480
shadows because of the focus on a need
for poetic justice of those who

624
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.400
knowingly live outside of God's light we
don't want to see these vampires

625
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.599
punished even if they are kind of shitty
people sometimes instead we Champion

626
00:49:22.599 --> 00:49:26.640
their personhood and even their small
victories over Petty Stu for who Among

627
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.599
Us has not had the dream of starting a
vampire nightclub or even just had a

628
00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:35.960
hard time looking for love without
realizing that what you were looking for

629
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.160
was there all along to accept the
vampire in their traditional form as is

630
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:45.599
often presented and what we do in the
shadows is to accept the full spectrum

631
00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:50.520
of what they were meant to traditionally
signify no longer does the sex positive

632
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.280
vampire require Poetic Justice near a
stake to the heart nor a decapitation

633
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.520
and consuming only a consensual amount
of garlic for what threat did Carmela

634
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.799
really afford to anyone if not the
occasional snatching of panties to our

635
00:50:03.799 --> 00:50:09.000
forebearers in Antiquity the real threat
was of Sex and the seduction though

636
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.240
specifically sex that defied the typical
Norms of patriarchal power dynamics the

637
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:19.079
man who is penetrated by another man the
woman who can exchange intimacy without

638
00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:24.240
a man the real evil of vampires was
their affinity for challenging the

639
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:29.200
conventional power structure
rures the murder thing was just icing

640
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:36.200
but the fear the real fear was sex
itself by no longer fearing the vampire

641
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:42.680
are we shedding a fear of sex or are we
too as a people abandoning the

642
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.440
patriarchal structures that so much of
History constructed itself

643
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.520
around if this is the moral Decay the
victorians feared so much Society does

644
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.359
not seem worse off for it if anything
Society is worse for enduring the

645
00:50:57.359 --> 00:51:03.200
throngs of violence against the vampiric
the Deviant women

646
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.559
queers sexuality has come out of the
closet no longer are we forced to hide

647
00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:12.119
in the shadows just because we're not
having sex to make the next generation

648
00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:16.559
of good God-fearing
Christians dim lamp light has turned

649
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:21.599
into livid LEDs brightening up the lives
of the sex positive for the whole world

650
00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:27.680
to see if they want and whether they
like it most do or not [ __ ] them we're

651
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.720
not turning those lights
off we don't have to

652
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.119
hide what we do in the
shadows
