hardcore porn both of the straight and
gay varieties

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.799
entered mainstream american culture in
the 1970s

3
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.480
as the sexual revolutions swept away
many of the cultural and moral

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.559
inhibitions that had been keeping the
country's proverbial knees together

5
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.640
surprisingly the first porn movie ever
to be previewed by variety the leading

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.720
trade journal in the entertainment
industry

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.080
was boys in the sand from 1971 a
sexually explicit gay movie shot on fire

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800
island with a budget of only four
thousand dollars

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.920
moviegoers celebrities and critics
flocked

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.600
to see it within a year deep throat a
straight porno opened to rave reviews

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.120
and a huge box office
exceeding that of many mainstream

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.719
hollywood films though we can't know
exactly how much it made

13
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.280
because it was financed by the mafia
within two years we saw the devil and

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.079
miss jones and behind the green door hit
theaters

15
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.640
these four movies made more money per
screen than even the godfather

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.879
which was released around the same time
though the sexual revolution that made

17
00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.360
these films possible was at first
a mostly heterosexual affair it also had

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
a profound effect on gay men
the intense stigma attached to

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.840
homosexuality before stonewall
blocked any open discussion of gay male

20
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.799
sexuality
and force gay men's sexual expression

21
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.799
deep underground
consequently the increasing acceptance

22
00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.799
of pornography during the 60s and 70s
played a significant role in the sexual

23
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.320
lives of gay men
even more than it did among the straight

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.000
men of the same age
the increasing social acceptance of porn

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.600
helped to legitimize visual
representations of homoerotic images

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.600
and gay sex in general before 1962
homosexual materials even those without

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.280
any sexual content
were considered obscene by definition in

28
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.920
the us and much of europe
the emergence of gay hardcore films

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600
provided explicit representations of
gay's sexual behavior

30
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.159
not otherwise available and the
availability of such images helped to

31
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.159
affirm the nascent gay identity
since most gay men become adults without

32
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.040
learning the social and sexual codes of
their community

33
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.239
porn contributes as film critic richard
dreyer has observed

34
00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.440
to their education of desire erections
orgasms and the performances of sexually

35
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.959
desirable masculine
and energetic performers helped to

36
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.160
create positive images of what gay men
could be

37
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.920
instead of the holy negative images
portrayed in mainstream culture

38
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.920
gay porn produced soon after stonewall
focused heavily on masculine men

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.440
since the culturally accepted image of a
gay man was that of the [ __ ] from

40
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.959
hollywood movies the artwork of toko
vago laxonen

41
00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.599
better known as tama finland helped to
create the image of the hyper-masculine

42
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.599
gay man
that permeated gay culture in the 1970s

43
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.000
and gay porn movies sought to emulate
these ideals with the men they cast

44
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.360
while it's by no means representative of
the entire gay community

45
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.400
these masculine stars showed gay men
both young and

46
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.840
old that they could be more than just
hairdressers not that there's anything

47
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800
wrong with that
if this pandemic has taught us anything

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.239
it's that we really ought to be
appreciating our hairdressers a lot more

49
00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.480
but these porn stars were plumbers
carpenters cops firefighters bikers and

50
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.000
construction workers
the type of men that gay men desired to

51
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.120
be and desired to have
desire psychologists have found is not

52
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.319
something given to
us out of the blue it is constructed

53
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.440
through fantasy
and it is through fantasy that we learn

54
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.200
how to desire
pornographic movies are passports to a

55
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.959
fantasy world where sex exists without
the everyday encumbrances of social

56
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.560
convention
endurance or availability to imagine a

57
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.080
sexual performance in a fantasy or to
see one in a porn movie

58
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.680
enables us to experience sexual
excitements without the side effects of

59
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.760
anxiety
guilt boredom or danger

60
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.000
and for many of us the erotic excitement
is heightened when the fantasy includes

61
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.640
an element of risk
sex in public sex with a stranger sex

62
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.239
without a condom
or sex in front of a salad

63
00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.040
lets us explore these fantasies
but porn didn't suddenly pop up in the

64
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.200
1970s fully formed and hard as a rock
porn even gay porn has been around for a

65
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.560
very long time
now i'm not going to get into cave

66
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.600
paintings egyptian carvings or
renaissance art though

67
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.759
this is a youtube video not a 10-part
netflix documentary though netflix if

68
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.120
you're watching call me
so let's start at the very beginning of

69
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:43.840
modern gay porn
i hear it's a very good place to start

70
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.569
[Music]

71
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
it's the 1950s and you're walking down a
busy new york street

72
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.360
you stop at a news stand and hidden
amongst the news cooking and culture

73
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.400
magazines
sits one or two issues of a physique

74
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.919
magazine
you buy it the clerk stuffs it into a

75
00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.160
nondescript brown paper bag
and you rush home it started as an

76
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.680
underground phenomenon with small
magazines containing photographs of

77
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.479
almost nude men being sold by mail and
on newsstands in larger cities

78
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.680
these physique magazines and the
mail-order business that grew up around

79
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.160
them
were the primary source of erotic male

80
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.919
images for gay men
receiving the iconic nickname beefcake

81
00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.000
bob mizer an amateur photographer living
in los angeles played a major role in

82
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.199
developing the business of publishing
homoerotic images

83
00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.680
at the time in post-world war ii america
most photographs of nude men or drawings

84
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.320
of erotic scenes
were available only through private

85
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.199
networks to select mail-order customers
long aware of his attraction to men

86
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.639
miser had taken nude photographs of
attractive male friends since he was a

87
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.280
teenager
and developed the film in a closet set

88
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.199
up as a dark room a few years later when
mizer was experimenting with grouping

89
00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.880
photos together
it occurred to him to create a magazine

90
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.120
he decided to call it physique pictorial
it featured photographs of young men

91
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.400
wearing only posing straps
bathing suits or loincloths and almost

92
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.440
no editorial content as fvhooven points
out in beefcake his history of the

93
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.960
physique magazine
the magazines were not merely one aspect

94
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.319
of a wider gay male culture
they virtually were gay culture

95
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.840
one writer estimated that the total
circulation of the beefcake magazines in

96
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.960
those oppressive times was over 750
000 probably the largest audience of

97
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.720
american gay male readers and consumers
assembled to that point

98
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.000
the cult of male beauty that the
physique magazines fostered helped to

99
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.720
shape gay men's physical ideals
before there was any common culture a

100
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.240
minuscule magazine featuring a bunch of
guys with their clothes off but not

101
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.000
completely naked may not seem like much
of a revolution in the history of sex

102
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.599
argues hooven
but to the men who bought them they were

103
00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.360
something new and daring
it took courage to purchase one of those

104
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.400
little magazines in 1955
by 1958 mizer decided to branch out and

105
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.759
began to shoot short eight millimeter
black and white films of the same young

106
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.960
men he was photographing
they would be nude or dressed in greek

107
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.160
tunics lounging by the pool or wrestling
in oil

108
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.440
made in his home studio now a
fortress-like compound of seven

109
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.440
buildings protected by razor wire
fencing and several attack dogs

110
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.360
i'm not kidding the films employed
simple storylines in which the youthful

111
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.680
performers usually played stock
characters

112
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.880
much like in the magazines the softcore
shorts were

113
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.800
gobbled up by his magazine's reader base
with the sale of home projectors going

114
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.840
up by 40 percent in the la area
with the release of the first film by

115
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.479
the mid-1960s bob miser had photographed
more than 5 000 male models

116
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:49.199
many of them street kids hustlers
bodybuilders actors soldiers and sailors

117
00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:54.160
one young man who showed up on miser's
doorstep in 1965 was joe d'alessandro

118
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.080
a young runaway from new york only 16
years old when he first showed

119
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.400
up joe had hitchhiked to california
after escaping from a juvenile home

120
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.319
he had since been supporting himself by
hustling and washing dishes in a pizza

121
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.360
parlor
one of his regular johns had recommended

122
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.960
he get in touch with mizer
he lied when they met and said he was

123
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.479
19. although mizer only shot one film of
d'alessandro

124
00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:20.319
it was enough to grab the attention of
andy warhol who snatched up the young

125
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.199
looker and started putting him in his
own films in new york

126
00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.879
his timing couldn't have been better
because there was a major crackdown on

127
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:30.720
erotic material in california
soon after d'alessandro modeled for

128
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.919
miser
virtually every physique studio in the

129
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:39.440
state was facing legal prosecution
for obscenity and prostitution charges

130
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.800
prostitution and nude modeling for
artists and photographers have a long

131
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.240
shared history
miser regularly recommended models to

132
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.080
other photographers and to
collectors even though he must have

133
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.440
realized that the young men were
probably being hired for sex but since

134
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.800
he had never directly benefited from the
exchange of sex for money from any of

135
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.839
his referrals
he did not consider himself vulnerable

136
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:03.279
at the same time over the years he had
developed an elaborate set of codes to

137
00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.080
summarize information about each of his
models

138
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.240
temperament honesty and physical traits
as well as sexual characteristics and

139
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.120
interests
he offered the key to the code to

140
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.279
various trusted customers
nevertheless the secret code seemed

141
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:21.040
suspicious to the lapd vice squad
who arrested him for running a

142
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.040
prostitution ring he was convicted
and by the time he returned to his

143
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:37.839
studio the world of gay male pornography
had dramatically changed

144
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:47.440
[Music]
for years gay men in la had lived lives

145
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.440
of secrecy and fear
the lapd had systematically harassed and

146
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.360
trapped arrested and brutally beaten the
city's gay lesbian and transgender

147
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.440
population
on new year's eve 1966 for example

148
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.160
patrons of the black cat on sunset
boulevard

149
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.480
many dressed in drag were attacked by
undercover and plainclothed vice cops

150
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.399
after a number of people exchanged
customary kisses at midnight

151
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.079
more than a dozen were arrested and
forced to lie face down on the sidewalk

152
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.200
until squad cars arrived to take them
away

153
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.279
officers chased one person to another
bar where they trampled the female owner

154
00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:26.000
and beat the bartender unconscious said
bartender was held in the er

155
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.920
for more than a week when he was
released he found out that he had been

156
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.320
charged with assault the men arrested at
the black cat were charged with lewd

157
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.399
conduct
all of them were found guilty on

158
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:42.399
february 11
1967 la's first gay demonstration to

159
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:47.680
protest police brutality took place
organized by pride personal rights in

160
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.600
defense and education
a group of younger gay men and lesbians

161
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.880
this event occurred more than
two years before the famous stonewall

162
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.240
riots sparking a rebellious streak in a
young filmmaker

163
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.160
named tom de simone a graduate of ucla's
film program

164
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.680
dissimone had worked for several years
in the film industry as an editor and

165
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.680
had directed a low-budget horror movie
that

166
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.600
had went nowhere he had been growing
bored of the soft-core well-oiled eight

167
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.279
millimeter bob miser clones that it
started filling gay porno theaters

168
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:19.040
and thought he could do better he began
filming erotic gay scenes with full

169
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.279
nudity but
simulated sex he delighted in more

170
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.880
psychological porn i was very
disappointed with films shown at the

171
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.079
park theater
he recalled later i remember seeing a

172
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:34.800
lot of young kids in them jumping around
on pogo sticks and other such nonsense

173
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800
the quality of the films was terrible
they were badly photographed and the

174
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.760
projection was lousy
i wanted to make one of these films and

175
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.440
really show some quality work
his first film to receive a wide release

176
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.320
or as wide as gay porn could go back
then

177
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.000
was the story of a gay man who kidnaps
young men and keeps them locked up in

178
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.240
cages for his sexual pleasure
while there was nudity the sex remained

179
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.040
simulated and no erections were shown on
screen

180
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.320
nevertheless the film drew the attention
of s m lovers

181
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.800
but also the fbi who harassed any
theater promoting a showing of the film

182
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.240
it was eventually cited by the u.s
commission on obscenity and pornography

183
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.680
as an unhealthy example of pornographic
film

184
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.000
dissimon's no erection s m wasn't flying
with the majority of patrons at gay porn

185
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.560
theaters either
they were seeing more and more eight

186
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.399
millimeter shorts involving actual sex
coming from unnamed parties

187
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:27.760
and so simulated sex kinky or not wasn't
going to cut it

188
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.120
making hardcore was against the law
according to captain jack wilson of the

189
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.240
lapd
you cannot make a hardcore film without

190
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.240
violating the prostitution laws when you
pay actors to engage in sex or oral

191
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.880
copulation
you've violated the laws you've

192
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.040
solicited individuals to engage in
prostitution by asking them to exchange

193
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.519
sex
for money because hardcore producers in

194
00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:52.000
the early 70s operated outside the law
many were fly-by-night operations

195
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
stories were written on matchbook covers
and dialogue was made up by performers

196
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.720
more noted for their looks than their
writing talent

197
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.720
one producer observed at the time
filming takes place on a single day

198
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.000
and the results are sometimes little
more than records of sexual activity

199
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.200
framed by the collective sexual
fantasies of the people who filmed and

200
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.639
edit one film a week
every week of the year the switch over

201
00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:16.240
to hardcore dramatically altered how sex
movies would be made

202
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.440
tom de simone believed that having to
perform real sex

203
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.040
changed who would be cast in hardcore
movies when you get into hardcore you're

204
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.399
dealing with a different class of people
you can't get actors or actresses

205
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.959
anymore just pimps and [ __ ]
but not everyone felt that way late one

206
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:34.560
night in 1970 after a rehearsal for his
new broadway show

207
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.160
director and choreographer wakefield
poole his boyfriend peter

208
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.519
and some friends decided to go to the
park miller theater to see one of

209
00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:44.639
disimon's films
it turned out to be a disappointing

210
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:48.079
evening and for poole a somewhat jarring
experience

211
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.279
unlike the dark and cruisy theaters that
screened straight porn

212
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:53.760
the lights inside the park miller
theater were bright enough that the

213
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.639
theater's customers could actually read
indeed one patron pool reported was

214
00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:02.240
reading the new york times
afterward they wondered aloud whether it

215
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.120
was possible to make a hardcore film
that was more erotic

216
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:16.610
and that wasn't so degrading
poole decided to find out

217
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:24.240
[Music]
like many other gay men wakefield pool

218
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.560
had come to new york in search of
something

219
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.639
he was a settler to use the new yorker
writer eb white's term

220
00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:34.480
it was the settlers who gave new york
its passion

221
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.519
poole grew up in the south but moved to
new york city as soon as he could to

222
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:41.440
pursue a career as a dancer
when his lover peter gave poole a 16

223
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.959
millimeter movie camera as a gift
almost immediately he began to

224
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:48.639
experiment with it
inspired by several amateur movies made

225
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.920
by steven sondheim shown at parties and
other social occasions

226
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.839
poole created a series of multimedia
dance events using light projections and

227
00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:58.399
film
in addition to more traditional stage

228
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.360
elements
he had also shot a short film in homage

229
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.680
to andy warhol after finding a painting
of himself in one of warhol's shows

230
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.440
several months after their outing to the
park miller theater poole and peter were

231
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.720
invited out to the fire island pines to
stay with friends

232
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.120
a narrow strip of sand and shrubbery
along the southern coast of long island

233
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.959
fire island was in the process of
becoming a mythic landscape

234
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.560
andre holleran wrote in his novel dancer
for the dance

235
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.480
fire island was for madness for hot
nights

236
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.600
kisses and herds of stunning men a
national game preserve annually

237
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.839
replenished by men each summer arrived
from every state in the union

238
00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:41.519
cherry grove on fire island the tiny
neighboring community to the south of

239
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.680
the pines
had been a well-known holiday

240
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.519
destination of gay actors writers and
artists since the 1930s

241
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:53.199
and a predominantly gay community making
it america's first gay and lesbian town

242
00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:57.199
the poet w h auden and his partner
chester coleman regularly came out to

243
00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:01.040
the grove in the early 40s
they were joined by an array of famous

244
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.639
gay artists and writers like christopher
isherwood tennessee williams

245
00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:09.440
and truman capote poole and his partner
made plans to spend several months on

246
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.560
fire island
and it was during this time that he

247
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.639
decided he would make his erotic movie
once he had formulated his plot and

248
00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:20.399
begun to script it he started to think
about how to cast it

249
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.839
he first asked his friends that he was
staying with who agreed but immediately

250
00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:27.360
had second thoughts
hours later poole ran into a man named

251
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.560
dino who worked in a little gift shop at
the hotel in the pines

252
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.160
the three of us had been flirting for
weeks poole recalled

253
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.000
i suddenly turned to him and asked him
if he'd like to be in a film with peter

254
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.600
they both looked a bit startled but
moments later we agreed to shoot the

255
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.519
next day at 6am
over the next few months poole edited

256
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:49.279
the scene into a 15 minute movie
when he showed it to a group of friends

257
00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:52.399
they claimed that it was the best porn
movie they'd ever seen

258
00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:56.720
marvin shulman his business manager
offered to invest in expanding it into a

259
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.639
feature-length movie
over a series of mondays pool shot the

260
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:04.640
rest of the film
that would make him famous it premiered

261
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.160
in downtown manhattan to sold out
showings of gay men straight couples and

262
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.880
film reviewers
with rave reviews from multiple

263
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.079
mainstream publications
the film broke through the red velvet

264
00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.640
curtain that separated porn
from legitimate movies wakefield pool

265
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.240
wasn't the only star to rise from boys
in the sand though

266
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.919
he also lucked into discovering the
first gay porn superstar

267
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:30.400
with casey donovan donovan had gone from
sixth grade teacher to fashion model to

268
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.160
porn star in the run of three years
and boys in the sand owed much of its

269
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.000
success to him and he said
i have this friend named wakefield pool

270
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.039
he used to be a dancer and a director
choreographer

271
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:44.080
and he's doing some experimental movies
on his own

272
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.440
out at fire island and i know you just
did this hardcore buck film

273
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.600
and would you be interested in being in
it i said well you know maybe i'd

274
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.360
i'd like to meet him and and maybe see
what he's done and then the rest is

275
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.760
history
boys in the sand catapulted casey

276
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.200
donovan into a unique position as the
first gay porn star

277
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.160
characterized as a gay liberated robert
redford the all-american male

278
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.919
he resembled and aptly symbolized the
newly liberated gay men living in new

279
00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:14.240
york city during the 1970s
blonde and blue-eyed with a well-toned

280
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.160
body and absolutely radiant smile
donovan exuded sex appeal and

281
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.520
communicated an almost irresistible
charisma

282
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.919
soon after boys in the sand opened after
dark a well-regarded arts magazine that

283
00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:29.600
dabbled in soft core porn
published a headshot of donovan in brief

284
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.240
mention of his appearance in boys in the
sand

285
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.360
then in march it offered an upper body
shot of donovan while referring to a

286
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.600
recent theatrical appearance
finally in july donovan appeared on the

287
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.480
cover with a spread in the side
a gay porn star had just become a

288
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.320
national celebrity
within weeks of boys in the sands

289
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.679
premiere jerry douglas a young
playwright and off-broadway director who

290
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:56.640
had directed a couple of nude plays
somewhat unique 1960s specialty

291
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.160
was approached by a director of tv
commercials to make a gay pornographic

292
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.880
film
producing a hardcore film was still

293
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.400
considered such a taboo project
that the film's backers asked douglas to

294
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.880
not reveal the production company's name
to anyone

295
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.160
to memorize the firm's address and
telephone number and to never put

296
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.039
anything in writing
the film would be a riff on the best

297
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:18.480
picture-winning midnight cowboy
and douglas decided without any

298
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.840
hesitation to cast casey donovan in the
lead

299
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.679
it opened a year later to packed
theaters in new york la san francisco

300
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:29.039
and montreal
but because exhibiting porn was a legal

301
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:32.000
gray area at the time
it was hard for filmmakers to ensure

302
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.280
that they were getting their cut
and there was no way of guaranteeing

303
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.559
that a theater owner wouldn't simply
duplicate the film print

304
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:42.160
give back the original and continue to
show the movie without ever having to

305
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.600
pay another dime
so theater owners in new jersey and san

306
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.559
francisco were shocked
when they were visited by members of the

307
00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:52.320
new york mafia
gay porn producers decided to take a

308
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.480
page from the straight porn book
and enlist the help of la casa nostra in

309
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.400
ensuring they got paid
this partnership eventually led to gay

310
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.960
porn being exhibited in mafia-owned
theaters in

311
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.640
most major cities removing the middleman
and increasing profits for both

312
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.720
producers and their italian enforcers
while the involvement of the mafia led

313
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.720
to many filmmakers leaving the business
jerry douglas among them it gave the

314
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.039
world of gay adult cinema
a solid bedrock to grow from unlike art

315
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.159
house theaters mafia run cinemas had the
money to bribe cops

316
00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:25.840
who would have otherwise confiscated
prince as obscene artifacts

317
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.960
gay porn now had creative and innovative
filmmakers

318
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.080
nationally famous stars a growing fan
base

319
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.480
and a rock solid distribution channel
there was nowhere to go but up

320
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:50.880
the supreme court ruled today that if
anyone wants to read dirty books or look

321
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.120
at dirty movies in his own home
he may do so and it's none of the law's

322
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.320
business
the law still may regulate the spread of

323
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.679
obscenity in public
but the court said a person has every

324
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:05.280
right to satisfy his intellectual and
emotional needs

325
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.679
in the privacy of his own home that the
law has no business telling anyone

326
00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:13.520
alone at home what books he may read or
what films

327
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.360
he may look at chuck holmes was the
sales manager for a company that

328
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.640
manufactured pre-fabricated houses
this super exciting career was what

329
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.000
brought him to san francisco in the
early 1970s

330
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
just in time for recession after losing
his job

331
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.600
since who can buy homes during a
recession even prefabricated ones

332
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.679
a friend of his suggested he start a
mail-order business selling gay porn

333
00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:41.200
which is everyone's go-to when they lose
their job he took the advice and

334
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.240
borrowed 4 200
to purchase a handful of already made

335
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.400
films and launched falcon studios in
april

336
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:54.000
1972. i wanted something that had an
image of fierceness and power and grace

337
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.280
and was
natural i thought a falcon represented

338
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.880
that
it was a bird of prey with sexual acts

339
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.720
at least the way that we make him here
at falcon

340
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.960
there's generally someone who is the
predator and someone who's the prey

341
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.280
no i don't mean that in a harmful way
but by the end of a falcon film somebody

342
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.760
has snatched
someone and given it to him good

343
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.880
business was slow at first since there
was a lack of product

344
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.919
he was relying on local producers to
provide him with the eight millimeter

345
00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:22.559
shorts he'd be selling
growing impatient with their inability

346
00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:26.880
to provide on time chuck decided to
start producing his own films

347
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.320
the first movie falcon made was a
two-part loop called muscle

348
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.280
sweat and brawn holmes followed these up
with taste my love part one and two

349
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.400
and ace in the hole subtlety in movie
titles was not his strong suit

350
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.400
most of falcon's short starred handsome
and sexually energetic young men who

351
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.000
went by nondescript names like tom
dan gary dave kenny rod phillip michael

352
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.880
bill and pete
a formula that would be replicated in

353
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.240
the new millennium by producers like
sean cody and corbin fisher

354
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.679
falcon followed the erotic formulas
developed by earlier producers

355
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:03.840
but in a more blunt fashion most of the
shorts portrayed sex scenes in a

356
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.080
straightforward manner with
simple production values lighting always

357
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.240
the most difficult to manage production
factor varied greatly from film to film

358
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.000
there were almost never expensive or
exotic locations and the loops rarely

359
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.799
showed dramatic or sexual action
that extended over a period of time

360
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:24.960
these were after all only short movies
consisting of one scene no more than 15

361
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.000
or 20 minutes long
for the most part they were built around

362
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.320
an anecdote never a full-fledged story
they merely provided a setup that

363
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.080
created a charged atmosphere
in which the sexual action could take

364
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.679
place from the beginning
holmes clearly envisioned the falcon

365
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:44.400
brand of sexual content to be
fast urgent desperate sexual contact

366
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.600
between two or more persons
as desperate as we can capture on film

367
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.279
or video
the basic formula at falcon has not

368
00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:56.240
changed and i do not foresee it changing
he said decades later more important

369
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.400
than picture sound quality for holmes
was grooming nobody could have dirty

370
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.919
feet in a falcon video
because i come from the midwest and

371
00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:07.520
they'd have these vfw
stags where they'd have these porno

372
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.840
movies and all the men and all the women
would

373
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.720
always have dirty feet and i always
thought those lazy bastards why don't

374
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.679
they wash those people's feet it's
distracting

375
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:21.600
holmes wanted to see the boy next door
who looked like they wouldn't ever do

376
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.440
anything but be the best little fellows
the little businessman the good members

377
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.480
of their community
and all of a sudden they'd just kiss

378
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.960
each other and all hell would break
loose and they'd just try to

379
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.400
[ __ ] each other to death holmes adopted
a business model built on aggressive

380
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.240
pricing and marketing policies
falcons set its price is considerably

381
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.200
above those of other companies eight
millimeter shorts

382
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.559
the high prices falcon charged for films
and later for its videos

383
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:48.960
went far beyond what was necessary to
support its cost to production

384
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.799
from the beginning falcon operated
strictly as a mail order business

385
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:56.320
though hardcore theatrical releases were
garnering other producers acclaim and

386
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.880
prestige
theatrical distribution was both more

387
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.919
expensive and riskier than the
production of shorts for mail order

388
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.559
distribution
we didn't want to let 16 millimeter

389
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:07.520
prints out of our hands
that's all you needed to make an

390
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.880
inter-negative and make all the eight
millimeter and super eight copies you

391
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.279
ever wanted
and back then there were a lot of people

392
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.400
in this business who did a lot of
illegal duping

393
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.919
falcon's policies stressing its mail
order business catered to customers who

394
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:23.279
were older and wealthier than the
audiences who attended theater showings

395
00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:27.279
more closeted as well they were also
more likely to live outside the

396
00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:30.000
metropolitan
areas that had large and growing gay

397
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.799
communities
falcon essentially moved gay porn to the

398
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.840
suburbs

399
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.960
throughout the 70s john travis matt
sterling falcon studios and numerous

400
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.240
other producers of gay male porn
incorporated a great deal of san

401
00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.400
francisco's gay sexual culture
the scale and intensity of the city's

402
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.320
sexual scene had created a distinctive
world of shared experience

403
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.039
anonymous sex in a communal setting in a
sex club or a bath house or at an orgy

404
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:12.559
led to a community based on pleasure
rather than politics

405
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:15.840
performing in porn was merely an
extension of the communal sex in which

406
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.360
so many men took part
the city's pornographers often took

407
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.880
their scenarios and images from the
city's gay sex life itself

408
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.000
they recruited performers from the
community and they translated their own

409
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.880
sexual experiences to the screen
in the fall of 1977 chuck holmes met

410
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.039
with his production and marketing staff
to discuss

411
00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:37.279
upcoming projects falcon's cameraman of
the moment colin meyer

412
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.200
a recent graduate of the film program at
san francisco state university

413
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.960
suggested that they make a series of
short loops putting all the biggest porn

414
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.919
icons at the time into one movie
three generations of the top gay porn

415
00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:52.559
stars as it were
they decided the film would feature

416
00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:56.640
three main stars al parker who had
become famous as a cult model

417
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.840
dick fisk a young up and coming
performer

418
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.520
and the by now legendary star casey
donovan

419
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.120
in a world of entertainment that had now
seen jaws and star wars change the movie

420
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.159
industry
this trio of gay porn royalty would make

421
00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:14.320
up the lead attraction
of the industry's first blockbuster the

422
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.000
other side of aspen
if casey donovan was the linchpin al

423
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.240
parker was the top dog
donovan and parker had never met but

424
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.600
donovan were considered parker one of
his porno dream men

425
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.640
almost 10 years younger than donovan
parker was born

426
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.760
andrew oaken in 1952. parker seemed
destined for porn since the day when as

427
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.640
a 15 year old
he stumbled across a tattered magazine

428
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.640
that included beefcake photos from the
legendary cult studios

429
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.399
around that same time parker attended
the famous concert at woodstock where he

430
00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:47.440
spent practically the entire weekend in
the back of a hearse

431
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.440
having sex with a hell's angels biker
and though barely in attendance at the

432
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.559
concert itself
he did manage to show up on the poster

433
00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:57.600
for the movie
the other side of aspen had started out

434
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.120
as a series of loops but once holmes
decided to create a framework linking

435
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.720
the scenes it quickly morphed into
falcon's first feature film

436
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.760
the production was probably the
smoothest porn shoot to date

437
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.760
having been cast with industry pros and
a strong directorial voice behind the

438
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.039
camera
it ran like a well-oiled machine once

439
00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.919
filming had wrapped
falcon ramped up its marketing strategy

440
00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:22.480
by sending out a pre-mailer with
reservation cards to its best customers

441
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.960
reservations poured back in then a
brochure was mailed

442
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.000
the response to the brochure was even
more enthusiastic

443
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.919
producing the highest revenues in the
history of the company up to that point

444
00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:37.919
five to seven times greater than ever
before the other side of aspen was

445
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:41.600
falcon's first blockbuster and like all
blockbusters it accounted for the lion's

446
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.039
share of falcon's earnings
its explosive impact marked a turning

447
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:48.640
point for a company selling its films
only through mail-order transactions

448
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.840
unwittingly preparing it for the coming
age of the vcr

449
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.440
falcon deciding to release the film on
vhs instead of betamax is considered by

450
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.720
home video experts
to be one of the reasons that vhs would

451
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.320
go on to win the format war against
sony's higher quality but more expensive

452
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.320
to produce betamax
it was good timing since many adult

453
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.399
theaters were being shut down
the success of aspen transformed falcon

454
00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:13.679
into a different sort of company
one that began to increase its

455
00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:17.039
production values and adopt other
policies such as signing performers as

456
00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:20.000
exclusives
an old school hollywood tactic that had

457
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.080
died out with the death of the studio
system

458
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.520
keeping certain stars under exclusivity
contracts in exchange for regular

459
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.399
paychecks
and only loaning them out for exorbitant

460
00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:32.480
fees that made falcon into a powerhouse
of gay porn companies

461
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.760
with aspen falcon discovered the midas
formula

462
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.039
it went on to produce four sequels in
its aspen series over the next few

463
00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:41.279
decades
often starring the most popular

464
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:45.039
performers of the day a sort of gay porn
time capsule

465
00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:49.600
falcon studios had built its brand as a
gay macho fantasy

466
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.320
the studio skewed anything that appeared
campier less than rigorously masculine

467
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.080
following the model the rest of the
industry had been built on for years

468
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.520
the castro clone archetype butch men
with middle class jobs

469
00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.200
had permeated gay porn all the way back
to the photography of bob miser

470
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.200
but the other side of aspen was a
milestone for the gay porn film industry

471
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.799
it signaled the culmination of the gay
macho sexual ethos

472
00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:17.679
and turned the ideal gay male body young
men with a swimmer's build no tattoos

473
00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:23.840
and little body hair
the age of twinks had begun

474
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:40.789
[Music]

475
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:45.200
william higgins was a late bloomer he
was approaching 35 and had never had sex

476
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.559
with either a man or a woman
he was running a stained glass business

477
00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:51.679
in houston where he taught housewives
how to make stained glass decorations

478
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:54.880
for their homes
he explored his sexuality by going to

479
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.080
theaters to watch gay porn
but he thought the movies were so bad

480
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.279
that he decided he wanted to go to
california and try to make better ones

481
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:05.519
and so in early 1978 higgins set out for
san francisco

482
00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:09.120
though he only got as far as los angeles
there he headed for hollywood

483
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.320
because someone had told him that that
was the gay area of town

484
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.919
as he drove down santa monica boulevard
lined with hustlers

485
00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:19.440
he knew he was in the right place
stopping for a bite to eat higgins met a

486
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.960
man and told him he'd specifically come
out to california to make a gay porn

487
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.840
movie
the man encouraged him well okay let's

488
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.960
do it he said
the man helped higgins to find a cast

489
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.080
and they shot the film in his apartment
the film would go on to be called a

490
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.720
married man it starred jack wrangler one
of the leading stars of the time

491
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.159
it all seemed so easy but filming was a
disaster

492
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:43.600
none of the performers got along they
disagreed about shooting performance and

493
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.840
editing
higgins had virtually no previous

494
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.080
experience with photography or
production

495
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.919
the film had been loaded backwards into
the camera and ended up underexposed

496
00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:55.919
nor did he have enough sexual experience
he had never even seen two men having

497
00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:58.640
sex up close
though the century theater booked the

498
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.600
film the owner
of new york's adonis theater declined

499
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.679
it was such an unpleasant experience the
higgins decided to call it quits

500
00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:11.039
he then took a job as a clerk at a bath
house in the san fernando valley

501
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:15.679
and settled down in venice beach venice
beach with its scantily dressed surfers

502
00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:19.360
and shirtless young men roller skating
proved to be too titillating a sexual

503
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.519
scene for higgins to ignore
i was walking around venice beach and i

504
00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:27.760
said
oh this would really be an interesting

505
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.279
movie
and so i started shooting some footage

506
00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:34.320
with film that we had left over from
making a married man

507
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.159
the footage shot sat on the shelf until
he received a call from monroe buehler

508
00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:42.880
an independent producer infamous in
hollywood for producing gay erotica wow

509
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.159
we really liked a married man and i'm
looking for a picture as my big

510
00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:50.399
christmas feature which is
you know an important thing why don't

511
00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:53.200
you make another film
higgins quickly agreed and put together

512
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.080
a film he called the boys of venice
set along venice beach the movie was

513
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.200
built around the youth culture that had
emerged incorporating the new roller

514
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.320
skating fad into the movie
the opening scene of the film takes

515
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.840
place in a small bathroom with two
performers having sex with roller skates

516
00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.880
on
stunt doubles probably would have been a

517
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.559
good idea the boys of venice was a
tremendous box office success and

518
00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.799
decisively launched higgins on his
career

519
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:19.919
he set up his own companies to handle
production laguna pacific and

520
00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:22.640
distribution
catalina video and went on to become the

521
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.760
most prolific gay porn filmmaker in the
united states

522
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.440
over the next five years he made 20
movies most of them record-breaking

523
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.480
successes
though boys of venice was filmed without

524
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.080
a lead kip noel emerged as the star of
the movie

525
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.440
he was the first major twink porn star
in fact

526
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.080
he personified the twink an attractive
young gay man with a slender build and

527
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.240
little or no body hair originally
recommended to higgins by monroe beeler

528
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.399
noel was not new to gay porn he had
performed before in a series of loops

529
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:56.399
for director mark reynolds
generally assumed to be straight null

530
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:59.120
actually seduced higgins on their first
meeting

531
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.679
when kipnuhl got off the plane he really
didn't look that good

532
00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:08.000
he had a look about him that was kind of
butch but not that attractive

533
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.839
part of it was his having a little
mustache that didn't work

534
00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:15.919
overall he just didn't look like he
would photograph that well

535
00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:19.200
higgins was about to send him back home
but i thought

536
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.040
i had to at least interview him the
first thing he did was say

537
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.879
let me show you what i look like and he
dropped his pants

538
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:32.399
which made me take a second look at him
at that point he said well why don't you

539
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:36.079
take your clothes off
now i try to keep these things very

540
00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:40.480
above board and business like but
he insisted for many kip knoll was the

541
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.399
iconic william higgins star
over the next three years they made four

542
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:48.000
other films together
kip knoll and the west side boys pacific

543
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.159
coast highway
class of 84 part 2 and brothers should

544
00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.800
do it
the prolific filmmaker was dominating

545
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.440
the video market when he decided to try
an experiment the experiment turned into

546
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.480
the film
class reunion a feature where he decided

547
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.960
to use all the stars from the past
invitations were sent out to 15 years

548
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.720
worth of performers but higgins had no
idea how many might eventually show up

549
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.640
for the shoot
multiple buses worth of performers ended

550
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.560
up making their way to the glendale
mansion in which they were filming some

551
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.280
people even snuck in who had never been
in a movie before

552
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.400
the shoot more or less became a giant
orgy

553
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.560
with three cameramen tracking around the
room constantly like an extended scene

554
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.680
from caligula
class reunion wowed audiences with the

555
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.240
sheer amount of men on film all at once
something that ambitious hadn't been

556
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.960
tried in gay or straight porn up to that
point

557
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.079
higgins would consider it his
masterpiece

558
00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:48.880
an ode to the joy and sexual abundance
gay men enjoyed at the time

559
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.320
it was the early 1980s

560
00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:14.000
and that was all about to change
[Music]

561
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.079
the discovery of what would eventually
become aids a new sexually transmitted

562
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:22.480
disease a disease that destroyed the
very mechanism that normally protected

563
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.920
the body from diseases
created a sequence of crises medical

564
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.119
social and political the aids epidemic
also provoked a crisis regarding sex

565
00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:38.160
itself within the gay community
namely bareback sex however before the

566
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.240
virus that caused aids was even
identified sexual promiscuity was

567
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.920
believed by many to be the most likely
aspect of the gay lifestyle responsible

568
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.440
for the spread of the disease
then simply called the gay cancer was

569
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.280
the sex gay men engaged in inherently
dangerous or bad

570
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.920
could gay men continue to engage in sex
at all if they risk death from aids

571
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.200
how could gay men have sex in an
epidemic of a sexually transmitted

572
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.320
disease
the debates both inside and outside the

573
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.520
gay community produced fatal
displacements

574
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.359
many of those most concerned failed to
address either the practical actions

575
00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:17.200
one could take to prevent spreading the
disease or how best to defend gay male

576
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.079
sexuality in the situation
as leo bersani pointed out attention

577
00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:25.040
turned away from the kinds of sex people
practiced

578
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.320
to a moralistic discourse about
promiscuity

579
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.240
the crisis about sex also created a
profound sense of paranoia

580
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.839
sex is just a completely different thing
now porn star and director al parker

581
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:38.480
exclaimed
the entire time you're having sex you're

582
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.000
thinking i'm having sex with
everybody this person's ever had sex

583
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.599
with i wonder what he's done i wonder
where he's been if he's positive or

584
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:49.599
negative i wonder if i'm
giving him anything and you if you can

585
00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.920
keep a heart on
while that's going on in your head

586
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.280
you're better than i am
since the aids epidemic had begun in

587
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.280
1981 the public debate about gay men's
sexual activities had grown increasingly

588
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.160
virulent
their sexual promiscuity was often

589
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.000
targeted as a public menace
in particular the danger posed by men

590
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.680
engaging in anal intercourse
with particular ire directed toward

591
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.400
those who were both topped
and bottomed since the late 70s anal sex

592
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.400
had become the focal point of gay porn
while it is difficult to document the

593
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.040
shift away from oral sex as the
normative activity

594
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.040
to anal sex was one of the major changes
that accompanied the sexual revolution

595
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.320
of the 60s and 70s
and one of the most notable developments

596
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.119
of gay male sexuality since the
stonewall riots

597
00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:34.320
was the dramatic increase of sexual
versatility

598
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.520
by 1985 the growing furor over gay men's
sexuality explicitly promiscuity and

599
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.920
more implicitly their sexual versatility
caused many producers of gay porn to

600
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.160
re-examine how sex between men should be
represented in erotic videos

601
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.320
i think that when aids happen it was
devastating to this business

602
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.839
i think it scared the [ __ ] out of
everybody when we

603
00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:59.520
found out how it was being produced and
of course when we then found out all of

604
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.119
our actors were dying
i mean i think it changed the industry a

605
00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:06.560
lot some people
went out of business i think because of

606
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.400
that aids activists and gay leaders
argue that porn should help eroticize

607
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.079
safer sex
porn stars could serve as role models

608
00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:17.520
for condom use
directors and producers hesitated to use

609
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.400
condoms because they believed that
showing performers taking precautions

610
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.760
and using condoms would inhibit the
sexual arousal porn films were meant to

611
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.040
provoke
nevertheless they paid some lip service

612
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.119
to these concerns
they were doing everything but using

613
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:36.160
condoms they were dancing around that
issue i would talk to chuck and i would

614
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.760
say you need to use condoms chuck you
have to use condoms i remember that was

615
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.720
one of the big bones of contention with
falcon was that they they were sort of

616
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.200
the last ones to come on board with
using a condom

617
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.960
the feeling was that the consumer
wouldn't buy a product that

618
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.680
depicted condoms in 1988 chris mann the
vice president of catalina video

619
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.880
announced that
aids became a factor about three years

620
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.720
ago we've really taken a hard look at
the situation

621
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.400
we've had to this is something that
drastically affects the entire nature of

622
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.280
our business
for activists and community leaders the

623
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.880
importance of porn stars
acting as role models blended with

624
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.280
concerns that sexual activities on the
set posed risks to the performers

625
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.640
most people in the industry believe that
the sex that took place on porn sets was

626
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.760
relatively safe
since performers had to pull out for the

627
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.240
money shot industry insiders frequently
argued that most performers understood

628
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.079
the risk and willingly chose to take it
in order to create fantasies that would

629
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:34.319
encourage many viewers to stay home
rather than engage in high-risk sex with

630
00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:37.760
another person
man explained what we would like to do

631
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.880
is have the erotic industry be a
positive influence

632
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.800
not a negative one the public knows
there's a health crisis

633
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.760
we show them how to have sex safely
and still make it a fun joyous

634
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.079
experience part of the celebration of
being

635
00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:58.800
gay is the celebration of your sexuality
if we did only safe sex films the erotic

636
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.200
value would truly be gone
after all when you watch a regular film

637
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.800
you don't go out and drive your car the
way those people do in street chases

638
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.839
it's a fantasy not real life
for decades gay sex had been limited

639
00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:15.839
only by the sexually repressive society
there were no natural limits to

640
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:20.000
threatened anyone's lifestyle
no pregnancy to worry about it almost

641
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.480
seemed that in
sex everything was possible aids

642
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.599
suddenly put on limits now sex
especially anal sex had potentially

643
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:33.040
fatal consequences
various studios claimed that they

644
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.920
screamed the actors who appeared in
their movies and used only healthy

645
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.880
performers
in an effort to avoid losing their

646
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.000
audience with performances that only
consisted of safer sex

647
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.040
studios first tried a more didactic
approach

648
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.400
starting in 1987 both catalina and
falcon studios

649
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.839
put three-minute long instructional
trailers produced by the gay men's

650
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:55.760
health crisis
on their videotapes even as late as 1988

651
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.359
condoms are
apparent only in a minority of films

652
00:41:59.359 --> 00:42:04.000
many producers and studios left safe sex
up to the performers themselves director

653
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.440
jd slater who adopted this laissez-faire
approach said

654
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.599
as far as safe sex in my work is
concerned i will not preach

655
00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:16.000
or morally judge i am simply a
documentarian of

656
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.040
sexual incidents what an actor does is
completely his own decision

657
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.920
i let an actor do exactly what he wants
any way he wants to do it

658
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.640
some directors think it's their job to
instruct the public on safe sex

659
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.119
and for them that's great but that's not
my responsibility

660
00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:38.640
there had always been a group of gay men
who were ambivalent about porn

661
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.599
they believed that porn promoted certain
stereotypes of masculinity and

662
00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:44.960
represented commodified forms of
physical desirability

663
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.040
but with porn increasingly considered a
safe alternative to casual sex

664
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.880
they had come to believe that the aids
epidemic had to some extent

665
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.359
legitimized porn porn became another
form of safe sex

666
00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:00.880
ironically while discussions among gay
porn producers were taking place

667
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.640
a fierce debate raged in congress over
funding for aids education

668
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.920
information or prevention materials on
october 11 1987 over half a million

669
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.680
lesbians gay men and their supporters
one of the largest demonstrations ever

670
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.599
to take place in washington dc
marched both for their civil rights and

671
00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:21.200
to protest the reagan administration's
failure to act promptly to address the

672
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.960
aids epidemic
the names project presented its memorial

673
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.920
quilt on the washington
mall in which the names of people who

674
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.720
had died of aids were inscribed in over
2 000

675
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.800
panels it covered the equivalent of two
football fields

676
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.960
days later in his introduction to a
debate senator jesse helms from north

677
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.359
carolina dismissed the demonstration as
this mob over here this weekend he then

678
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:46.880
proceeded to introduce legislation
guaranteeing that no aids prevention

679
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.560
literature
or efforts would go to gay communities

680
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.440
the amendment he proposed sought to
prohibit the use of any funds provided

681
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.880
under this
act to the centers for disease control

682
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.359
from being used to provide
aids education information or prevention

683
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:08.720
materials and activities that promote
encourage or condone homosexual

684
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:15.680
sexual activities there is a
feeling among members of any of

685
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.440
a number of professions or just the
general population

686
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.560
that patients with aids many of whom are
homosexual are a little bit different

687
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.480
i think that that has led to a little
bit of a complacency

688
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:34.000
about the approach towards this disease
it seemed that neither congress nor the

689
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
gay porn industry
wanted to acknowledge that condoms would

690
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.160
make sex safer
nevertheless some insiders were critical

691
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.880
of the porn industry's stance
terry legrand of marathon films declared

692
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.960
producers are very wrong when they say
we must produce a fantasy for the viewer

693
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.119
i say
[ __ ] fantasy time is over fantasy

694
00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:58.480
has to stop
i think the biggest message we can give

695
00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.760
to people is through
videotapes as long as it's you know

696
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.280
subtly done
if they see enough movies where people

697
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.720
are getting screwed with condoms
then maybe it will become a part of

698
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.920
their own lives
not long after making that statement

699
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.720
commercial producers attempting to be
responsible

700
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.240
and activists and public health
educators wanting to be effective

701
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.960
adopted similar approaches they finally
began producing safe sex porn

702
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.400
though many companies refused to give in
to condom usage until the dawn of the

703
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.000
90s
despite the chaos of the aids crisis or

704
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.200
more likely because of it
the porn industry was booming in the

705
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.640
1980s
as dave kinnick a gay porn reviewer and

706
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.280
videographer noted
the anti-sex backlash of the 80s had a

707
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.839
devastating effect on the nation's
bathhouses and x-rated theaters but it

708
00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:49.920
fueled profits
in the video industry people may have

709
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.240
stopped having sex but they certainly
hadn't stopped

710
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.599
wanting sex like bathtub gin during
prohibition the popularity of videos

711
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:01.599
soared casey donovan was actively
involved in

712
00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:04.720
several of the early attempts to develop
safe sex videos

713
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.760
but otherwise he saw no need to change
his own way of life

714
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.359
while sex was the basis of donovan's
professional life it also continued to

715
00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:14.160
be one of the most important activities
in his personal life

716
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.560
he seemed to be almost insatiable and
would frequently engage in casual sex

717
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.800
between appointments with his escorting
clients

718
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.560
toward the end of 1984 donovan and
wakefield pool decided to return to fire

719
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.640
island and shoot boys in the sand too
they both hoped the sequel would revive

720
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.000
their sagging fortunes
neither had achieved any great success

721
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.880
independently of their first joint
venture

722
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.560
he hoped the sequel might again put him
on the covers of magazines and give him

723
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.240
national recognition
one friend recalled that he was more

724
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.680
buliant than ever
and i could clearly see that he was

725
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.440
trying to keep in check his
fantasies of becoming the man of the

726
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.119
moment all over again
but the film wasn't released until two

727
00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:56.480
years later the producer had died of a
heart attack on the day pool started

728
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.119
shooting the film
and the ownership of the film stock was

729
00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:01.839
subject to legal battles lasting over 20
months

730
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:06.079
by the time it came out in 1986 there
was no buzz or anticipation

731
00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:10.960
no moment of renewed celebrity the world
it came into was quite different from

732
00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.440
the one the original boys in the sand
had entered

733
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.240
it was more competitive in a field
created by the new technology of video

734
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.079
and the sequel offered a vision of sex
that seemed outdated

735
00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:26.000
in the era already dealing with aids it
seemed innocent

736
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.720
and naive boys in the sand too opens
with donovan and another man having sex

737
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.440
in the shrubbery
in another scene the famous scene from

738
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.920
the first version of boys in the sand is
reprised

739
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.960
in which donovan emerges from the bay
only in this film a young pat allen

740
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.280
emerges from the bay
as donovan returns to the waves

741
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.319
seemingly forever
a year later in august of 1987 casey

742
00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:54.079
donovan passed away
though he never publicly disclosed his

743
00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:59.920
infection

on march 10 1987 larry kramer stood

746
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.079
before a large audience of gay men at
new york's lesbian

747
00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:24.240
and gay community center in greenwich
village cramer was the country's most

748
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.760
vocal critic of both the federal
government and gay communities failure

749
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.640
to address the aids crisis
in 1983 he had founded gay men's health

and social services for the gay men

heart one of the longest running plays
ever at the public theater

753
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.400
to dramatize the situation behind its
establishment on that march evening

754
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.240
kramer read from his 1983
aids manifesto 1112 and counting

755
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.760
our continued existence depends on just
how angry you can get

756
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.240
four years later the number of aids
cases had reached 32 thousand

757
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.319
while any number of issues spurred his
wrath that evening the tipping point was

758
00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:09.920
the overly restrictive drug testing
policy of the federal government's food

759
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.800
and drug administration
which thus far had prevented the

760
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:17.440
development of any medicine to treat hiv
and aids he was also exasperated by the

761
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.000
failure of gay men's health crisis to
lobby

762
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.400
or take an advocacy role he appealed to
his audience

763

do you want me to start a new
organization devoted solely to political

796
00:52:07.599 --> 00:52:11.359
jeff striker
it was the first time any publication

797
00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:17.680
devoted to erotic photography and porn
had published an obituary of a porn star

798
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:21.040
it was to be a regular feature of man
shots magazine

799
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.240
douglas felt that it was time for the
adult film industry to acknowledge that

800
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.599
many performers were dying
of aids in the editorial introduction

801
00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:32.240
douglas compared the origins of
mainstream filmmaking with the

802
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.920
development of gay porn
during the 20s when silent filmmaking

803
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.440
was at its zenith few of its
practitioners thought of their work as

804
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.000
an
art form or imagined one day their

805
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.240
flickers would be
treasured in museums and archival vaults

806
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.920
silent film making if we are to believe
the memoirs of griffith chaplin and

807
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.200
especially senate
with a carefree chaotic business in

808
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.839
which people were delighted to be paid
for being a little bit crazy

809
00:52:57.839 --> 00:53:02.160
today historians dig with the intensity
of archaeologists to reconstruct the

810
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.880
days and data of that era
we suspect in time the output of the

811
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.359
carefree chaotic business of skinflix
will also achieve the status of

812
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:17.040
treasures
and future historians will likewise try

813
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.839
to reconstruct the days of early porn
to that end this magazine attempts to

814
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:26.400
give some order to the first quarter
century of gay erotic filmmaking

815
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.079
jerry douglas saw many of his friends in
the industry die of aids

816
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:35.119
drug overdoses and suicide but
he lived long enough to see the

817
00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:38.640
memorialize in a class on the history of
gay erotica

818
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.839
taught at his alma mater yale university

819
00:53:56.079 --> 00:54:00.000
not long after helping to launch man
shots magazine jerry douglas decided it

820
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.040
was about time he returned to producing
films

821
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:07.280
for his first project fratrimony douglas
wrote a short script about two brothers

822
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.680
and their sexual obsession with each
other

823
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.760
since it was his first film in 14 years
he sought to make it as contained as

824
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.960
possible
both thematically and practically all of

825
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.359
the film's action takes place in one
house

826
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:23.280
and only two performers appear in it it
was unusual for a pornographic film to

827
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.520
have only two performers
but the movie was an immediate hit a

828
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.920
master had returned to the industry
the film was nominated for avn awards

829
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.359
for best gay picture
best gay actor and best gay director the

830
00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:38.799
success of fratrimony inspired douglas
to make another film

831
00:54:38.799 --> 00:54:42.160
almost immediately the germ of a new
idea began to grow

832
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.640
while at the annual avn awards show in
las vegas douglas has seen shishi leroux

833
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.160
the drag persona of up-and-coming porn
director larry pasciotti

834
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.400
perform and was stunned by her
flamboyant presence and style

835
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.400
larue was a lavish personality who
frequently emceed and sang at industry

836
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.880
events
though they had long had a telephone

837
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.160
relationship while douglas was a
magazine editor and larue the marketing

838
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.960
and promotions manager at catalina video
douglas had never seen larue perform she

839
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.640
had recently left catalina to direct
videos for anahana productions

840
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.240
after seeing her performance in las
vegas douglas wanted to build a movie

841
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.839
around leroux
but he asked himself how do i build a

842
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:23.760
gay porn movie
around a full-figured drag queen it came

843
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.040
to him over lunch with larue who
brought along a handsome brunette

844
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.880
performer named joey stefano
at lunch that day stefano talked about

845
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.839
the difficulties he had coming to terms
with his sexuality because of his

846
00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:37.760
catholic background
stefano's struggles gave douglas an idea

847
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:41.119
within weeks of returning from la
douglas had written a script about a

848
00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:44.559
young man's coming to terms with his
homosexuality against the backdrop of

849
00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:48.720
the catholic church
and aids activism douglas incorporated

850
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.319
some aspects of the relationship between
larue and stefano as well

851
00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:56.720
douglas felt that more of a man was the
first real film i made

852
00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.799
i think that's the first time i really
hit my stride and got it right

853
00:56:00.799 --> 00:56:05.040
all the elements came together not only
douglas's extensive experience as a

854
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.480
playwright and theater director
his pioneering role as a director of

855
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.000
erotic films and his wealth of knowledge
of the gay world as a journalist and

856
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.440
observer
but also the strong erotic appeal of the

857
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.240
actors and above all
the exact and delicate appreciation

858
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.160
of the historical forces sweeping across
the gay world

859
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.559
more of a man sets the sexual action in
the actual context of gay male life in

860
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:32.240
the late 1980s
a time overwhelmed by the aids epidemic

861
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:36.079
filled with the fear of sex and riddled
by doubts that aids could be stopped

862
00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:40.160
the main characters represented the two
poles of gay male sexual life

863
00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.839
one a young man torn by guilt and
self-hatred overwhelmed with a sense of

864
00:56:43.839 --> 00:56:46.640
sin and unwilling to identify himself as
gay

865
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.160
and the other a self-accepting gay man
in a long-term relationship

866
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.119
an aids activist the young construction
worker engages in risky sexual

867
00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:58.960
encounters with strangers
anonymous sex and public bathrooms while

868
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.799
the activist uses a condom even during
sex with his long-term partner

869
00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:06.240
the film was made within an industry
that had hesitated for years to portray

870
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:10.400
explicit sexual action using a condom
douglas showed that within the grim

871
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.720
historical setting powerful and arousing
sex could take place

872
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.960
more of a man won four awards at the
1990 avn awards

873
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.400
including the best gay video best
screenplay

874
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:28.400
best non-sexual role for shishuluru and
best performer for joey stefano

875
00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.599
stefano was born nicholas iacona on new
year's day

876
00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:35.119
1968. after his father's death when he
was 15

877
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:39.680
he resolved to escape his small town of
chester pennsylvania by becoming a model

878
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.880
he put together a portfolio with the
help of a local photographer

879
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.640
and soon met tony davis an adult
performer who introduced nicholas to gay

880
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.960
porn
after meeting shishi leroux who

881
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.559
christened him joey stefano
and starring in more of a man he

882
00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:56.240
instantly rose to stardom
not just within the world of gay porn

883
00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.160
but outside it as well
he created a hit clothing line and was

884
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.160
featured in multiple madonna projects
the singer was so smitten with joey that

885
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.520
she was apparently devastated when she
found out that he was actually gay and

886
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.960
not gay
for pay talent agent david del val who

887
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.839
represented multiple hollywood actors
and some of the biggest stars on

888
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:15.920
broadway
was thoroughly convinced that he could

889
00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.440
turn joey into a leading man
and began shopping him around to casting

890
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.720
directors
shockingly they were pretty open to

891
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.079
having him read for upcoming parts gay
porn history or not

892
00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:29.839
he was a talented actor oozed charisma
and had the type of movie star good

893
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:33.839
looks that are rare
like tom cruise with prettier eyes joey

894
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:36.079
also took frequent trips back to
pennsylvania

895
00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:40.319
to visit his older sister linda who he
adored and who had helped him get sober

896
00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:42.960
after developing a drug problem in his
late teens

897
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.640
a habit he'd picked up to numb the pain
after his father's death

898
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.400
he was a doting uncle to her children
and even gave her away at her wedding

899
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.400
on one trip back in 1994 he told her
that he planned to leave porn

900
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.799
since david dalvall was busy lining him
up auditions for mainstream movies

901
00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:01.839
in the meantime he was willing to mop
floors or wash dishes

902
00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:05.119
whatever it took to keep the bills paid
while he waited for his hollywood dream

903
00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:08.160
to come true
before leaving linda's house that summer

904
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.880
he told her that he had some
unfinished business in la it was in la

905
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.520
that he received the news that he was
hiv positive

906
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.040
there was still no effective treatment
for the disease and he felt hopeless

907
00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.960
joey stefano was found nearly lifeless
in a hollywood motel room

908
00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.400
his ashen body spread across
sweat-soaked sheets

909
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.559
garbed in only a red hoodie he was
pronounced dead later that day at cedar

910
00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:34.400
sinai medical center
the cause of death was an overdose of

911
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.720
cocaine morphine and heroin
a lethal combination that everyone who

912
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.680
knew him said was obviously suicide
i'll always wonder whether i could have

913
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.880
gotten through to him that night whether
he could have believed what i was

914
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.880
telling him del val said later
could he have had an acting career

915
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.400
because let me tell you he really had it

916
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.599
the ramifications of the aids crisis
continued to rock the porn world well

917
01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.720
after the discovery of protease
inhibitors that kept the disease more or

918
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.920
less at bay
much like the rest of the gay community

919
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.440
stars in the gay porn world spent a
decade and a half burying their friends

920
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.960
colleagues and lovers
it wasn't until stray people began

921
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.520
contracting the disease via blood
transfusions

922
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.640
that any money was put into aids
research in america

923
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.319
the bulk of said money was earmarked for
abstinence campaigns

924
01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:28.160
instead of research or safe sex
awareness the christian right wing and

925
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.640
let's be honest many of the left wing as
well

926
01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.000
argued that porn stars and sex workers
should be excluded from any kind of

927
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.559
possible aids-related government-funded
assistance

928
01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:41.119
or even drug trials video stores under
pressure from family groups

929
01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:45.280
began to carry fewer adult titles
arguing that porn with or without a

930
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.240
condom
straight or gay would lead to dangerous

931
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.599
sexual practices
especially among college students away

932
01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:55.760
from their parents watchful eyes
many convenience stores stopped carrying

933
01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.319
adult magazines the playboy penthouse
and hustler were mostly safe

934
01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:04.000
and under the guise of stopping sex
trafficking the clinton administration

935
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.799
advised the u.s postal service to stop
transporting pornographic material it

936
01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:12.079
wasn't illegal to sell porn in your
stores or for shipping companies to

937
01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:14.559
deliver it
but at the time some people in the

938
01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:17.920
industry felt like they were just
waiting for the other shoe to drop

939
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.760
bill clinton's re-election campaign in
1996 turned shockingly conservative

940
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.319
across the board
and with the recent underage porn

941
01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:28.880
scandals surrounding tracy lourdes
many directors producers and performers

942
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.079
felt that
porn's time in america might have come

943
01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:39.839
to an end
but then

944
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.839
the birth of the internet was a
revolution for many industries but most

945
01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:46.880
of all porn
making the purchase of adult films

946
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.160
easier and more private
the internet helped the industry grow

947
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.480
from an industry worth an estimated 800
million dollars in 1996

948
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.880
to 10 billion dollars in 2006.
the adult entertainment industry

949
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.400
revolutionized the internet as well
it was pornography producers that

950
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.599
finance the software and technology
necessary to make secure online

951
01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:09.520
purchases with credit cards
a conglomerate of gay porn studios hired

952
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.200
coding specialists in the mid 90s
to streamline the display of photos

953
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.079
online and then the ability to stream
video

954
01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:20.079
technology that would later be adopted

955
01:02:20.079 --> 01:02:24.240
european gay porn studio bellamy was the
first company to stream live video over

956
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.359
the internet
creating a whole new industry of webcam

957
01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:30.480
sex shows
in 2003 their streaming technology was

958
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.119
bought by a small telecommunications
startup

959
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:37.680
called skype by 2010 pornography was
estimated to make up ten percent of the

960
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.000
entire internet
in 2020 that estimate has changed to 30

961
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.280
percent
there are more paid subscribers to porn

962
01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.359
sites in 2020 than there are to netflix
and that's not taking into account the

963
01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:53.520
vast amount of ad-supported porn on
sites like x-tube and pornhub

964
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.200
lowering the barrier of entry to gay
porn via the internet is believed by sex

965
01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.640
educators to be one of the biggest
influences on the spike in homosexuality

966
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.079
and bisexuality
among the general population it's not

967
01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:06.720
that there are suddenly more queer
people than ever before

968
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.160
but that it's easier for them to explore
their sexuality in a consequence-free

969
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.720
way
by 2004 there was more porn than ever

970
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.720
with countless professional and amateur
producers filling up the internet

971
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.720
niches that has long gone under served
suddenly had entire sites dedicated to

972
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.520
them
and quickly it became very obvious that

973
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.400
the most popular genre of gay porn was
the barely legal kind

974
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:44.040
a genre that was about to rock the
billion dollar industry to its very core

975
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.099
[Music]

976
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.520
at the end of the 20th century brian
coaches was an unemployed medical

977
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.000
photographer in dallas township
a small town in pennsylvania he was so

978
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.640
hard off that he'd had to declare
bankruptcy

979
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.079
coaches started cobra video in hopes of
hitting it big and to many people's

980
01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:04.400
surprise
it worked he had a knack for finding

981
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.079
cute boys who would work for cheap
and appealing to the fans of barely

982
01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:12.079
legal porn because of this
coach's company grew quickly with adult

983
01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:15.039
video stores unable to keep his videos
in stock

984
01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:18.720
coaches couldn't resist mixing business
with pleasure though only a few months

985
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.440
after getting into porn he almost
scuttled his new career

986
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.920
in the spring of 2001 coaches met a
young pennsylvania boy in an aol chat

987
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.359
room
who used the screen name superboy298

988
01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:33.839
although the boy was only 15
coaches picked him up twice each time he

989
01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:36.319
had sex with a boy including once on
camera

990
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:40.240
after promising him a job packaging
cobra videos for online orders the boy

991
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.400
eventually spilled the beans to his
parents

992
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.000
police and the fbi raided the house and
took away pornographic material

993
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.079
audio equipment and cameras initially
charged with several felonies including

994
01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:52.720
the sexual assault of a boy who he had
videotaped

995
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.240
coaches was allowed to plead guilty to a
lesser charge when prosecutors realized

996
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.200
that the boy had lied about his age
with the exception of the sex tape

997
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.760
coaches made prosecutors were forced to
return

998
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.319
every item they had seized from him
including 600 porn videos

999
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:10.319
placed on probation for one year coaches
served no jail time

1000
01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:13.359
by 2004 he had left his run-in with the
law behind him

1001
01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:16.160
and had become one of the most
successful producers of gay pornography

1002
01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.200
in the world
he drove a bmw a maserati and an aston

1003
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.520
martin
had a large house and more money than he

1004
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.880
knew what to do with
all of this came from making videos of

1005
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.720
his kennel of twins having sex
and no twink was more responsible for

1006
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.920
paying for those cars
and that house than sean lockhart aka

1007
01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.440
brent corrigan coaches had discovered
lockhart online

1008
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.839
he was a rare find a dead ringer for zac
efron with charisma and sex appeal to

1009
01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:44.000
spare
while lockhart was still a junior in

1010
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.680
high school coaches made and distributed
films that featured the 17 year old

1011
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.359
off the set he wielded obsessive control
over the teenager's life

1012
01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:55.839
desperate to know at all times where
lockhart was and who he was talking to

1013
01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:59.280
the dvds and downloads of lockhart's
quickly became the top sellers in the

1014
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.400
industry
one film schoolboy crush was the most

1015
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:07.039
downloaded gay video of 2004
but as lockhart's fan base expanded

1016
01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:10.000
coaches faced a problem
the young star wanted to strike out on

1017
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.920
his own coaches was paying lockhart only
two thousand dollars per scene

1018
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.000
about the industry standard at the time
for a handful of scenes each year

1019
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.400
coaches by contrast reportedly cleared
two million dollars a year

1020
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.520
lockhart was determined to work for
other studios though and so coaches sued

1021
01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.440
him for breach of contract
demanding one million dollars in damages

1022
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.480
the teenager was backed into a corner
born in idaho on halloween in 1986

1023
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.319
sean grew up in the seattle area his
mother who he described as an alcoholic

1024
01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:40.880
with a temper
left him with his stepfather and three

1025
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.200
siblings when sean was in the third
grade

1026
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.039
lockhart never knew his biological
father and never sought him out

1027
01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:50.400
my mother never wanted to tell me
anything about him he said

1028
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.960
her flawed philosophy on parenting was
to give me the space i needed to live my

1029
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.359
life
when sean was a junior in high school he

1030
01:06:57.359 --> 01:07:00.000
moved to san diego to live with his
mother in a shabby house

1031
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.520
in a rough neighborhood he was
interested in film and the move enabled

1032
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.640
him to establish state residency
so he could attend film school in

1033
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.760
southern california being gay made him
unpopular

1034
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.079
so he took refuge in the drama society
he also became a regular in hillcrest

1035
01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:17.920
san diego's wealthy gay enclave sexually
active at 16

1036
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.160
he was soon fending off men left and
right it wasn't an easy time though

1037
01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.400
sean's brother called him [ __ ]
constantly and his stepfather another

1038
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.559
alcoholic ran into trouble with the irs
growing up in my family it wasn't

1039
01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:33.599
encouraged to show a lot of love to each
other

1040
01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:37.839
i just remember a lot of hate fighting
and yelling

1041
01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:41.200
i don't recall ever having a positive
adult role model

1042
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.200
at 16 he began spending his weekends in
los angeles with his new boyfriend

1043
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.359
a 21 year old he called jake the two had
met online and jake became the first in

1044
01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:52.640
a series of older lovers eager to
exploit lockhart's looks

1045
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.039
in 2003 jake and aspiring porn star
himself had applied for a job at cobra

1046
01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.520
video
the company owned by brian coaches he

1047
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.280
was turned down
too old but sean who looked 12 was

1048
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.200
exactly what cobra was looking for
considering how hand to mouth he and his

1049
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.319
mother were living sean was willing to
give porn a try

1050
01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:14.240
in an online chat jake gushed about
lockhart to coaches

1051
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.040
i have the hottest new boyfriend who is
17 he's about to turn 18

1052
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.960
he wrote to prove it he slipped off
sean's shorts while he was sleeping

1053
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.040
and turned on his webcam to give coaches
a live dose of lockhart

1054
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.359
coaches was hooked sensing the massive
following lockhart would have

1055
01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:35.120
he contacted shawn almost every day
chatting online and on the phone for

1056
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.600
hours
coaches sent lockhart a video camera

1057
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.199
which sean used to film a casting tape
of himself masturbating

1058
01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:44.880
brian was good at talking at my level
lockhart says

1059
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.799
he asked a lot of questions he wanted to
know about my family situation

1060
01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:53.440
and about how inattentive my mother was
he sort of took the place of my father

1061
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.359
and i thought he was
looking out for my best interests

1062
01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.640
coaches had the kind of childhood that
lockhart could only dream of

1063
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.480
as a boy brian rose to the rank of eagle
scout and won a nationwide photography

1064
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.839
contest
if sean couldn't have an ideal childhood

1065
01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:11.440
he'd try his best
to have an ideal adulthood in february

1066
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.480
of 2004 nine months before his 18th
birthday

1067
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.120
sean began shooting movies for coaches
performing alone and with other models

1068
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.560
under two contracts he signed with the
director lockhart was to receive an

1069
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.759
unspecified amount for each action scene
he shot

1070
01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:28.960
in addition he would be given a 2002
volkswagen jetta

1071
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.440
a set of four rims and tires insurance
premiums worth twenty one hundred

1072
01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.719
a cell phone plan and an unspecified
signing bonus

1073
01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:40.560
to a teenager living on the edge of
poverty this was significant money

1074
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.719
lockhart chose a stage name brent
corrigan by flipping through a telephone

1075
01:09:44.719 --> 01:09:48.480
book on a shoot in florida
in an online column he wrote later for a

1076
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.319
gay porn gossip site
sean said i could easily disappear for

1077
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:55.679
four days for a shoot and
lie to my mother about where i was going

1078
01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:58.719
i was in it alone i
promised myself i would do the work to

1079
01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:02.800
get what i needed and then
turn my back on it i was still somewhat

1080
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.400
ashamed
of my homosexuality let alone having

1081
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.840
participated in gay porn
despite lockhart's misgivings brent

1082
01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.600
corrigan became a star
dvds featuring him sold briskly at sixty

1083
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.640
dollars per copy
as did online downloads at eight cents a

1084
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.239
minute he gained even more notoriety
when schoolboy crushed and three other

1085
01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:23.600
corrigan titles were pulled from store
shelves and internet sites after it

1086
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.880
became clear that lockhart had been
underage during their production

1087
01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.360
it all started one day in august 2004 a
woman who lived next door to coaches

1088
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.920
approached lockhart who was painting
brian's house

1089
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.520
she demanded to know how old he was
denouncing coaches as a pedophile and

1090
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.880
threatening to call the police
afraid he would be arrested lockhart

1091
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.000
packed up his belongings and headed back
to san diego where his mother

1092
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.760
was living with her latest boyfriend in
a one-bedroom apartment

1093
01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.840
sean moved in with them and graduated
from high school with few job prospects

1094
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.120
no money for school
and working for a hundred dollars a week

1095
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.719
shawn was at a dead end
then he met grant roy a well-off

1096
01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:01.360
trucking executive who was a fan of his
work

1097
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.040
a relationship quickly developed between
the two and roy decided they needed to

1098
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.960
wrestle control of brent corrigan's
brand away from brian coaches

1099
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.560
they set up a website to promote
lockhart and formed a new porn company

1100
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.080
coaches sued charging lockhart with
trademark infringement claiming to own

1101
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.360
the branch oregon name
in a counter suit lockhart alleged the

1102
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.480
coaches had engaged in fraudulent
business practices

1103
01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.239
which left him in emotional distress the
lawsuit created further difficulties for

1104
01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:30.080
lockhart who had left cobra to film the
velvet mafia with falcon studios who had

1105
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.440
agreed to pay him ten thousand dollars
for two scenes

1106
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.360
far above the industry standard but as
soon as legal threats arrived from

1107
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.239
coaches falcon refused to build lockhart
as brent corrigan

1108
01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:43.840
calling him fox rider instead feeling
like they'd have to produce their own

1109
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.800
videos
roy began looking for models online

1110
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.280
where he came across a picture of a buff
jock type named harlow quadra a navy

1111
01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.000
veteran who made his living as a male
escort in the military

1112
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.159
town of virginia beach quadro wanted to
move beyond escorting and make even

1113
01:11:58.159 --> 01:12:02.480
bigger money in online porn
a brent corrigan fan he struck up an

1114
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.800
email correspondence with lockhart and
roy

1115
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.400
which led to talk of forming a porn
partnership quadra and his boyfriend

1116
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.920
joseph carakas
made plans to meet them on january 11th

1117
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.560
at a gay porn trade show held in las
vegas

1118
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.760
the two couples sat down for dinner at
lucerck in the bellagio and the

1119
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.920
conversation immediately turned to
business

1120
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.760
cuadra and caracas came on strong
wanting to strike a deal right away

1121
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.280
they offered an obscene amount of money
to do you know a couple of scenes and i

1122
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.960
just
was like this is ridiculous

1123
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.960
whatever reservations lockhart and roy
had everyone at the table knew that

1124
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.600
there was a major impediment to any deal
brian coaches as long as cobra had

1125
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.040
lockhart tied up in court
the star could not film under the name

1126
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.800
brent corrigan for both lockhart and
quadra their fame and future livelihoods

1127
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.040
seemed to hang on a single middle-aged
man

1128
01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.120
back in pennsylvania so quadra made a
proposal that struck both lockhart and

1129
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.560
roy as strange
what if brian left the country he asked

1130
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.800
roy understood exactly what was being
suggested

1131
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.400
we don't need coaches to leave the
country he said changing the subject

1132
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.080
when dinner ended lockhart stumbled back
to his hotel room and passed out

1133
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.400
neither he nor roy called the police
within days their lawsuit with brian

1134
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.239
coaches was settled
brent corrigan was now a free agent

1135
01:13:14.239 --> 01:13:17.199
information that never made it to cuadra
and caracas

1136
01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:20.719
a day after the trade show ended
according to police quadra used his

1137
01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:24.960
discover card to run a 39.95 background
check on brian coaches

1138
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.800
the check turned up his address on
midland drive two days later on january

1139
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.199
22nd quadra created a new email account
the first message sent from it went to

1140
01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:37.600
cobra cobravideo.com
an account used by coaches the sender

1141
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.960
introduced himself as
danny moylan and said would like to

1142
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.320
model happy face
coaches invited him to come visit the

1143
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.239
next evening as kochus was speaking on
the phone to his attorney in california

1144
01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:51.679
danny moylan arrived the director said
that he had to go

1145
01:13:51.679 --> 01:13:56.239
and he sounded on top of the world less
than two hours later coaches was dead

1146
01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:59.760
stabbed 28 times his throat had been
slashed

1147
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.840
and his house set on fire he was only
identifiable by dental records

1148
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:09.040
the next day quadra called lockhart go
to the wnep website quadra said

1149
01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.960
referring to the abc affiliate in nearby
scranton which was reporting

1150
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.120
on the murder of brian coaches sean
changed the channel

1151
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.120
dropped the phone and threw up it didn't
take long for police to zero in on

1152
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.760
quadra
finding pictures of him on coaches hard

1153
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.679
drive but they needed more than just
pictures and some chat history

1154
01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:31.679
meanwhile quadra and caracas were using
their newfound infamy as suspected

1155
01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:33.840
killers to improve their business
prospects

1156
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.920
they promoted their startup film studio
on [ __ ] gossip sites that ferociously

1157
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.120
debated the murder
cuadra and crackus also made it a point

1158
01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.840
to keep in touch with their potential
business partners

1159
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.440
at 10 14 am on march 3rd grant roy
received an email

1160
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.880
hey grant it's harlow so when we gonna
start filming

1161
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.560
you know we had an agreement three
minutes later roy received

1162
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.800
a more ominous message don't [ __ ] with
us

1163
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.719
to cement their deal quadra and caracas
came to san diego for another meeting

1164
01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:06.480
by now however roy and lockhart were
cooperating with the police

1165
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.000
they had come under intense suspicion
after coaches was killed and they wanted

1166
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.880
to clear their names
so both agreed to wear a wire when they

1167
01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.800
met with quadra and caracas
on april 27th as a police helicopter

1168
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.000
worried nearby
the foursome reunited over lunch at the

1169
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.679
crab catcher restaurant in la hola
roy asked quadra if brian coaches had

1170
01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:27.600
felt any pain when he died
don't worry quadra said leaning over to

1171
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.400
lockhart
he went quick the four men agreed to

1172
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.719
meet again the following day at black's
beach

1173
01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:36.640
a clothing optional spot north of san
diego cuadra seemed to think that no

1174
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.239
clothes would mean no wires
promising to tell lockhart and roy

1175
01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:44.480
everything when they were on the beach
nude apparently unaware of how small

1176
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.080
recording devices had become
at the beach the talk eventually turned

1177
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:54.000
to the day coaches was murdered
we were trying for you know some form of

1178
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.760
confession but really
when it came down to it it was more they

1179
01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.040
knew
so much about what they'd done that that

1180
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.400
was damning enough
on may 15th four months after the

1181
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.320
killing harlow quadra and joseph carakas
were arrested in virginia beach and

1182
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.520
charged with homicide
robbery and arson after lockhart

1183
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.800
testified
both were found guilty and sentenced to

1184
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.760
life in prison
without the possibility of parole

1185
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.760
lockhart and roy eventually broke up
with sean going on to have an extensive

1186
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.440
career in gay porn
as well as in some mainstream movies the

1187
01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.960
whole ordeal was made into a movie
starring james franco and former disney

1188
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:34.000
star garrett clayton in 2016
though the accuracy of its portrayal is

1189
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.679
questionable at best
since then sean has pulled back from the

1190
01:16:37.679 --> 01:16:42.080
spotlight preferring a more private life
he prefers to not talk about brian

1191
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:49.840
coaches
or harlow quadra

1192
01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.159
within months of the brian coach's
murder and the porn world was rocked

1193
01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:03.040
with another gut punch
the streaming video software they had

1194
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.719
helped to create in the late 90s
was coming back to haunt them the launch

1195
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:10.400
of pornhub.com
inspired by the still young youtube

1196
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.000
pornhub was a site designed to allow
aspiring porn performers and horny

1197
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.880
imagers
to post videos online for the world to

1198
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.040
see within weeks of the site's launch
people were already uploading videos

1199
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.760
from sean cody corbin fisher falcon and
bellamy

1200
01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.760
it was a copyright nightmare the legal
fees of which could send many companies

1201
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.480
into bankruptcy
but not only were people posting

1202
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.320
copyrighted videos to the service
but studios now had to compete with free

1203
01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.400
porn available to anyone
charging 60 per video seemed absurd in a

1204
01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.440
world where people could find high
quality pornographic videos for free

1205
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.040
with the click of a mouse
seancody.com became particularly

1206
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.000
litigious
suing not only people who uploaded their

1207
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.199
videos to sites like pornhub
but also attempting to sue anyone who

1208
01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:54.800
watched them pornhub tried to gain some
goodwill from the industry by taking

1209
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.280
action and removing copyrighted content
but industry professionals didn't care

1210
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.480
pornhub was breaking the business model
that had been in place since the days of

1211
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.560
mail order loops
if you wanted to watch porn you paid for

1212
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.120
it
some studios suggested pornhub allow

1213
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.400
people to upload their amateur videos
but to require a paid subscription to

1214
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.600
watch them
the question then became was it legal

1215
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.560
for pornhub to make money from amateur
content

1216
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.080
if not how would they pay the uploaders
how could they be sure people were

1217
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.440
uploading original content and not
simply ripping amateur looking videos

1218
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.159
from other sites
and uploading them as their own their

1219
01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:32.400
headache came to an end in 2010 when
pornhub was purchased by manwin

1220
01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.480
now known as mindgeek a canadian tech
company that had spent the last few

1221
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.880
years buying up adult websites across
the net

1222
01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.239
the montreal-based company specialized
in online advertising

1223
01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:46.159
and was optimizing their streaming video
sites to feature ads for adult products

1224
01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:49.840
and any company secure enough to have
their brand associated with porn

1225
01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.199
traditional studios like falcon began
buying ad space on mind geek owned

1226
01:18:53.199 --> 01:18:56.000
websites
creating an uneasy partnership between

1227
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.640
enemies but
things were about to get a lot more

1228
01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.480
uneasy over the next decade mind geek
would become a monolith in the porn

1229
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.679
world
as of 2020 they owned pornhub porn md

1230
01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:08.960
redtube uporn browsers digital
playground men.com

1231
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.880
sean cody and countless other formerly
independent porn producers and providers

1232
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.239
they even own a steak and playboy
vertically integrating their streaming

1233
01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:20.000
and production businesses by advertising
professional productions from men.com

1234
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.600
sean cody and browsers on amateur videos
on their tube sites

1235
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.120
eventually uploading entire videos from
their production arm to act as a tease

1236
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.679
for everything available behind the
paywall

1237
01:19:29.679 --> 01:19:33.040
many in the industry today both in the
straight and gay worlds accuse mind geek

1238
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.880
of holding a monopoly over the industry
while others claim mind geeks simply saw

1239
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.600
the future coming and prepared for it
before anyone else

1240
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.600
today mindgeek is the third top consumer
of internet bandwidth in the entire

1241
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.280
world
behind only google and facebook with 115

1242
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.520
million daily users they dwarf youtube's
average of 30 million daily users

1243
01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.960
it's also estimated that mindgeek has
the world's third largest pool of

1244
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.560
monetized user data with only facebook
and amazon beating them out

1245
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.760
with offices in montreal dublin london
hamburg bucharest la miami and san diego

1246
01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.600
they are by far the most far-reaching
porn provider and producer on earth

1247
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.679
they've swallowed up many of their
competitors though you wouldn't know it

1248
01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:15.280
they buy studios with an area press
release and keep them running

1249
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.880
advertising their content on their tube
sites and paying themselves for the ad

1250
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.360
space
as mind geek buys up production

1251
01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.320
companies their website's monthly
membership costs drop

1252
01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.239
since mindgeek makes most of its revenue
from advertising and big data

1253
01:20:28.239 --> 01:20:31.520
which puts pressure on other producers
to lower their own monthly membership

1254
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.000
fees
a trend that has led many companies to

1255
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.159
slash how much performers are paid
in order to remain profitable this is

1256
01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:41.120
all that killed the decades-old studio
system in the porn world

1257
01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.960
in which a performer will sign an
exclusivity contract with a studio

1258
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.080
those contracts are now exceedingly rare
except

1259
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.320
with studios owned by mind geek to make
up for the lost income many performers

1260
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.800
have turned to independent production
and distribution

1261
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.880
with websites like only fans just for
fans and even patreon popping up to

1262
01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.960
allow individual models to charge a
monthly fee for self-produced content

1263
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.639
another nail in the coffin of
independent studios mind geek doesn't

1264
01:21:06.639 --> 01:21:09.520
mind though
since most of the performers will upload

even though mind geek owns much of the
porn world at this point

1267
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.120
it's very likely you've never heard of
them they stay under the radar on

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.280
purpose
and their own website is so vague you

1269
01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.320
wouldn't take them for anything but
another generic tech firm

1270
01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.600
even their headquarters situated not far
from downtown montreal

1271

reflective glass it blends in almost

1272
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.520
seamlessly with the sky above
mind geek's secret monopoly has changed

enough content to keep subscribers happy

1276
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.880
unlike the mainstream film industry's
disastrous response to netflix

1277
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.960
porn studios have adapted quickly helix
studios for instance has become well

1278
01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.760
known for producing videos that are
closer in quality to high-end

1279
01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.040

opera looking videos from

another studio aiming for a more

1282
01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:08.719
cinematic quality to their porn
hearkening back to the days of when

1283
01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:14.480
pornographers looked at adult movies as
sexy films with a lot of sex instead of

1284
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:25.840
just sex

1285
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.239
[Music]
it's interesting to see porn evolve in

1286
01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:33.120
recent years
as companies fight to distinguish

1287
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.120
themselves from mind geek's monolith
fans of the videos are seeing nothing

1288

1294
01:22:57.199 --> 01:23:00.239
70 years
from the photos of bob miser to the

1295
01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:02.800
films of tom de simone and wakefield
pool

1296
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.000
to the creation of studios like falcon
and catalina

1297
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.280
through the aids crisis and thousands of
lost lives

1298
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.960
the creation of the internet
unprecedented growth violent murder the

1299
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.639
rise of a monopoly
and now the democratization of the

1300
01:23:16.639 --> 01:23:19.760
industry
gay porn helped to create the home video

1301
01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.199
market helped push vhs to a win over
betamax

1302
01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:27.360
and developed the very technology being
used to stream this video today

1303
01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.440
the story of gay porn in the 20th and
21st century is a lot like that of gay

1304
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.960
people ourselves
hidden in the closet like so many bob

1305
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.120
miser photos
sparking a revolution to be acknowledged

1306
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.639
fighting through a plague no one wanted
to see us get through

1307
01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:47.440
and finally now to some kind of
acceptance in the mainstream

1308
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.040
though many would be loathed to admit it
[ __ ] has helped to shape what it

1309
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.400
means to be gay
it was a rare look at gay sexuality when

1310
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.679
we were nothing but villains and jokes
in hollywood films

1311
01:23:57.679 --> 01:24:00.880
a place to feel accepted when straight
couples lined around the block to see

1312
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.120
the boys in the sand
a fantasy refuge from the aids crisis

1313
01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.400
when being gay
could be a viral death sentence a

1314
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.080
digital space to feel accepted in
when the bush administration fought to

1315
01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.639
enshrine gay discrimination into the
constitution

1316
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:19.600
a place to see ourselves as desirable
when people call us freaks

1317
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.199
it says something about our society that
porn was at its most popular its most

1318
01:24:23.199 --> 01:24:27.199
mainstream
50 years ago with the boys in the sand

1319
01:24:27.199 --> 01:24:30.560
and deep throat being bigger hits than
anything hollywood put out

1320
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.480
what happened why did porn go back in
the closet

1321
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.320
the conservative tsunami that hit north
america in the 1980s certainly did its

1322
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.360
part
but have we not progressed since then

1323
01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.639
gay men and women fought
and won the right to get married and

1324
01:24:44.639 --> 01:24:47.760
serve in the military
two of the most conservative

1325
01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.679
institutions on earth
and yet many gay men won't admit that

1326
01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:56.320
they watch porn
in a 2019 poll 66 percent of gay men

1327
01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.760
said they were embarrassed to talk about
porn with friends they were afraid

1328
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.159
people would think they were perverts
while 50 years ago we stood in line to

1329
01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:07.679
see porn in a movie theater
porn isn't about to have a theater

1330
01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:10.960
resurgence not when hollywood itself is
going more and more digital

1331
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.320
but i believe we need to open our minds
and stop being ashamed of who we are and

1332
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.679
what we watch
we fought for decades to not have to

1333
01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:21.760
hide in a closet
and yet we keep our porn hidden we

1334
01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.080
fought to not be ashamed to our families
to not be shamed by the population at

1335
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.800
large for loving who we love
and here we are two decades into the new

1336
01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.520
millennium
we can get married serve in the military

1337
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.239
run giant corporations run for president
and yet we're still ashamed not ashamed

1338
01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:47.199
of being gay
but ashamed of gay sex i think

1339
01:25:47.199 --> 01:26:25.209
it's time we stop being ashamed
