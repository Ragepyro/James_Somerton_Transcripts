00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.160
hello everyone
my name is james and today i'm going to

2
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.000
explain to you how marvel comics
accidentally created a gay power couple

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.519
and despite their best efforts to avoid
it how disney might be giving us our

4
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.720
first
big screen gay superheroes going from

5
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.000
the holocaust to superheroes nothing
like tonal whiplash

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.719
well that's not entirely true
there's a sort of connection since we

7
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.200
will be talking about the scarlet witch
who is sometimes a mutant and

8
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.760
occasionally the daughter of magneto who
is

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:58.850
usually a survivor of the holocaust
let's get started

10
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.880
[Music]

11
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:22.529
[Music]

12
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400
i wasn't always a fan of comic books
outside of a batman trade paperback here

13
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.920
and there
you know self-contained stories i wasn't

14
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.479
ever really interested in the ongoing
developing stories of comics that have

15
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.320
stretched from now
all the way back to the 1930s but all

16
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
you really need to become a lifelong fan
is one character and because these

17
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.799
universes are
interactive that one character can

18
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.079
expose you
to other characters who can then expose

19
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.560
you to larger stories
and then before you know it you know

20
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.360
more about marvel or dc
characters than your own family i mean

21
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.920
there are worse habits all things
considered

22
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.319
meth keepsakes or dental problems marvel
comics over the years doesn't have the

23
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.599
best track record when it comes to gay
characters though

24
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.280
well most comic book companies don't
really

25
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.480
northstar barely gets any attention at
all loki's queerness is

26
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.480
swept under the rug at every opportunity
they get and iceman's recent gay

27
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.400
revelation was more of a screw you from
brian michael bendis to isaac perlmutter

28
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.040
than a
well thought out storyline though what a

29
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
wonderful up yours to pearl mudder it
was

30
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.280
if you don't know who isaac perlmutter
is don't worry i'll get to him

31
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.319
so you'd probably be kind of shocked to
find out that in current marvel comics

32
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.720
the most powerful magical person in the
marvel universe

33
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.760
is a gay character and his boyfriend is
literally the king of space

34
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.959
and those two characters billy kaplan
and teddy altman

35
00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.879
better known as wicken and hulkling are
the most shipped couple

36
00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.319
in all of marvel fandom and they are the
children of some

37
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.840
very powerful and very weird marvel
characters

38
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.780
[Music]

39
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.800
there aren't many marvel kids as in
characters who were born to

40
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.000
existing characters in the marvel
universe which is weird

41
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560
because comics are soap operas and that
[ __ ] usually gets eaten up

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.080
but children in comics create a bit of a
weird problem

43
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.280
namely the timeline most things in
comics and marvel uses this

44
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.360
especially are left ambiguous as to when
exactly they happen it makes sense for

45
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.120
thor to look the same after 40 years but
iron man's only aged maybe 5 or 10 years

46
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.440
since the 1960s
marvel comics loves to use a sliding

47
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.720
scale of time
for instance references to tony stark's

48
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.080
capture and creation of the mark 1 iron
man suit change

49
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.920
depending upon when the particular story
was told

50
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.000
this could be the korean war vietnam or
conflicts in the middle east

51
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.159
which you'd think they'd use that as a
theme about the omni presence of the

52
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.200
american war machine
and the role that technological

53
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.159
innovations and weapons profiteering
plays into that

54
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.000
you know like stanley intended that was
before marvel corporate decided that

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.120
having a conflicted heroic character was
a bit too spicy

56
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.960
okay thank you nick anyway children of
existing characters

57
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.680
rock this flexible time scale because
they put hard dates on parents ages

58
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.840
the parents minimum age must become the
age that they were when the child was

59
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.160
born plus however old the child becomes
so what does that mean for billy and

60
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.360
teddy whose prominent marvel parents are
the scarlet witch

61
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.280
the vision and marvel aka the first
captain marvel

62
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.000
and especially how do these very strange
parents factor into how the characters

63
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.840
are built
for teddy this is easy imagine romeo and

64
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.320
juliet set in space
only juliet is a shape-shifting green

65
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.680
alien
the doomed relationship was tied to a

66
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.960
much larger event in marvel the kree
skrull war

67
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.960
we've already seen both of these species
in the movies featured prominently in

68
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.440
guardians of the galaxy
and captain marvel but in the comics the

69
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.039
script is flipped
the skrulls were the evil devious bad

70
00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.919
guys and not
an analogy for refugees like they are in

71
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.840
the mcu and also
the kree scroll war started specifically

72
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.639
because marvel impregnated princess
inel of the skrull empire it should be

73
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.680
noted that marvel was never really that
popular though marvel tried to push his

74
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.320
significance to the credit of a small
cult following the real reason he was

75
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.919
kept in publication
was because dc had their own captain

76
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.720
marvel and marvel comics didn't want to
let them have the copyright to the name

77
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.160
dc's captain marvel would eventually
become shazam

78
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.680
but as soon as dc threw in the towel on
their captain marvel

79
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.440
marvel comics seem to give up on keeping
marvel

80
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.160
regularly published which is why he
more or less vanished from publication

81
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.240
history culminating in his canonical
death in 1982

82
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.319
his real contribution to marvel was his
legacy both in the way the title

83
00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.240
of captain marvel was shuffled around to
a number of different major characters

84
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.960
and in carol danvers who began as a girl
power spin-off to captain marvel

85
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800
ms marvel and ended up eclipsing the
original's popularity

86
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.240
eventually becoming the current reigning
captain marvel and

87
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.400
of course he left behind that dangling
thread about what happened to his wife

88
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.960
and child
when they ran away together at the end

89
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.520
of the crossover event
because the princess was never seen

90
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.680
again
by the time the young avengers come

91
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.639
around teddy altman is introduced as a
mutant with shape-shifting abilities

92
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.880
not out of the ordinary for mutant
powers really but there's a twist

93
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.680
it turns out that the skrull princess
actually sent her cree skrull hybrid son

94
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.360
then dorak viii renamed as teddy with
his

95
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.720
skrull nanny to hide him away from her
father

96
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.759
she remained with the autocracy and
eventually perished

97
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.080
furthermore as marvel himself was a
significant figure in the kree society

98
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.440
and the princess was the sole heir to
the skrull empire

99
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.800
that places teddy precariously in a
singular spot of

100
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.280
importance in two of the most
significant galactic societies in marvel

101
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.560
and if it's starting to seem like
there'd be literally

102
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:32.960
nobody in his dating league just wait
billy kaplan is the son of the scarlet

103
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.280
witch

104
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.240
sort of he like her is a mutant though
how he came to be is a okay

105
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.479
timeout you missed a pretty big pretty
significant part of her development okay

106
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:47.840
right but that doesn't really play into
bill let me finish

107
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.759
the scarlet witch may be a mutant and
her parentage has been in question for

108
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.440
most of her publication for a large part
it was believed that magneto was her

109
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.599
father though this would change
depending on

110
00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.199
the writer or the decade and whether or
not disney and fox were in a spat

111
00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.199
nick let me finish just come say this to
the right camera so i don't have to do

112
00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.840
back and forth editing so much
that means i have to put on pants yes

113
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.000
this is youtube and i don't want to be
demonetized again

114
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.919
so you do have to put on pants all right
give me a second

115
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.479
what did you just do i put on pants
james

116
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:29.280
jesus the things i do for you
so as i was saying before being rudely

117
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.560
interrupted by the pants please
it's not entirely clear if she is or

118
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.919
isn't a mutant as per details in her
most recent solo title

119
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:40.320
regardless of her status as a mutant her
mutant powers called hex magic

120
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.599
are secondary to her status as both a
nexus being

121
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.720
and a genetically altered conduit to the
primordial god

122
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.360
kithon which grants her access to his
reality rewriting chaos magic

123
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.120
which itself is ambiguous and it is
because of this magic

124
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.720
as well as her own study of witchcraft
and not necessarily her potential mutant

125
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.160
powers that she was able to
conceive her children and then cast them

126
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.839
through time and space to be raised
uh separately by two completely unaware

127
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:10.160
families oh
thank god all right so very few

128
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.920
characters
in marvel have had as many changes and

129
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.480
tweaks made to their powers as the
scarlet witch

130
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.000
originally yes she started out as a
mutant but she was

131
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.480
rescued by magneto who recruited her and
her twin brother quicksilver

132
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.360
into the brotherhood of evil mutants at
this time her powers were

133
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.080
as nick said hex magic after abandoning
the brotherhood she joined the avengers

134
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.440
with quicksilver
her powers were basically the most

135
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.600
silver age thing
ever essentially the avengers would get

136
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.240
caught in a sticky situation with a bad
guy

137
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.480
and would then depend on her hexes as a
last-minute

138
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.760
ex-machina moment in every issue
because comics unlike other characters

139
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.360
villains and heroes in which meticulous
care was given to explaining how their

140
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.720
powers worked
wanda's abilities were left as vague as

141
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.560
possible
even sometimes to the extent of becoming

142
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.480
a liability to the team
over time however it seems that wanda

143
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.160
and quicksilver's abilities were
inconsistent and sometimes failed

144
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.279
altogether
deciding to return to their home the

145
00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:18.560
fictional nation of transia
with the key landmark of wundergor

146
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.079
mountain the maximoff twins learned that
they were not

147
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:25.680
as they thought born to romani parents
but rather

148
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.360
adopted they were born in a genetic
facility

149
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.000
inside wunderguard mountain both of them
were taken from birth and genetically

150
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.519
redeveloped by the high evolutionary
i need to explain who he is please don't

151
00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:43.440
james i need to
maybe in another video anyway due to

152
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.880
genetic re-encoding by the high
evolutionary wando is accidentally made

153
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.959
into the living conduit and avatar of
the primordial god chithon

154
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:54.800
who functions as sometimes a god of
chaos

155
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.000
other times just a god of the underworld
but he's

156
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.920
usually overshadowed by other demonic
figures such as mephisto who features

157
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.160
later
this was the first time that it was

158
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.360
really indicated that the scarlet witch
was more powerful than it originally

159
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.079
seemed
this was pivotal when chithon possessed

160
00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:13.600
wanda to try and return to the world so
that he could unmake it

161
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.519
this plan was thwarted but it was very
clear that wanda was

162
00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:22.800
a potential threat so the avengers began
looking into options of how to safeguard

163
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.880
her
eventually in a crossover with the

164
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.160
fantastic four wanda encounters agatha
harkness

165
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.480
who is kind of america's number one
witch agatha believes she has a solution

166
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.720
for wanda's unpredictability
where she uses witchcraft as a conduit

167
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.000
to first of all
help wanda focus her powers and have

168
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.079
more control over them
secondly witchcraft gives wanda a

169
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:48.640
connection to the natural world
where she can prepare hexes in advance

170
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.440
and have
much more control over the outcome

171
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.000
though she was unnatural in witchcraft
wando's priorities were always the

172
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.519
avengers
and she never devoted much time to the

173
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:04.399
study of witchcraft with agatha
agatha however served as a guide to

174
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:07.760
assist her
with her abilities whenever she could oh

175
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.600
now's a good time to mention a mortise
right

176
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.000
no nick it's in the script though
i'm sorry okay ongoing problem for the

177
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.399
avengers was kang the conqueror
a time traveler but there's a version of

178
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.880
kang
where he goes so far into the future

179
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.920
that he becomes immortus
who is kind of a morally ambiguous

180
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.000
micromanager of time
sometimes friend sometimes foe depends

181
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.639
on the version of immortus because
there are many and after much will they

182
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.800
won't they the scarlet witch gets
married to

183
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.880
the vision because comics but it's not
like all of this happened over two

184
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.200
issues
these are stories that have been crafted

185
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.000
over two decades of weekly titles
granted this was when comic books

186
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.320
actually took their time
to pay off plot lines instead of trying

187
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.839
to cram everything together into eight
issue runs that just changed the status

188
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:01.920
quo every month
by the time the vision and the scarlet

189
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.320
witch get married on the urging of a
mortise

190
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.480
all of the pieces have been adequately
set in place for years before this

191
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:15.200
so wanda and the vision get married and
things are going okay but

192
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.440
then there's this big pocket of magical
energy that some evil witches want to

193
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.399
use to make a
evil spell gonna do bad stuff and again

194
00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:28.160
is like
hey wanda this is a this is a bad idea i

195
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.040
need you
to channel the energy so they don't get

196
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.079
it and rwanda's like
what's the worst that could happen so

197
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:38.480
this power makes wanda so
well powerful that she's able to

198
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.440
actually rewrite the very fabric of
reality

199
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.560
and because wanda's newly wed to a man
with no genitals

200
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.560
she uses it to make herself pregnant
this is also when magneto shows up for

201
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.120
the birth of the children and he reveals
in a true mooring moment that he was the

202
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.440
father of the maximoff twins
you are the father but wanda doesn't

203
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.760
just want to be a homemaker like sue
storm

204
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.760
she wants it all she's going to be a
part-time avenger and a full-time mom

205
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.279
so when the west coast avengers need a
reserve member to help out

206
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:10.399
wanda and vision tag along but the thing
is

207
00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:14.560
weird things start happening with
wanda's twins billy and tommy

208
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.079
the sitter sometimes just can't find
them for instance

209
00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:21.120
meanwhile after the vision tried to take
over all the computers in the world to

210
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.760
become the human version of the cree's
supreme intelligence

211
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.600
a couple of world governments decide
that he's a bit of a threat capture him

212
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.600
and completely disassemble him which you
know

213
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.839
wanda's not that pleased with the
avengers then gaslight her into thinking

214
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:40.399
that she has nothing to be upset about
because the vision was a robot anyway

215
00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:44.240
you can't fall in love with a robot
synthesizoid right so with the vision

216
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.279
rebuilt as little more than a catatonic
zombie

217
00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:50.959
wanda comes under a vast amount of
duress because he then

218
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:55.199
agrees with the avengers telling wanda
that her feelings for him are irrelevant

219
00:14:55.199 --> 00:15:00.880
and then he dumps her wanda now has
nothing but her beloved children who

220
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.120
it is revealed vanish when wanda isn't
thinking about them

221
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.720
that's why the babysitters were so
stressed out cue agatha harkness

222
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.560
so megan is like okay girl sorry but
your kids don't exist turns out that the

223
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.079
energy you absorbed was
two fragments of mephisto's soul who

224
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:22.160
who's like the satan of marvel
oh okay there are a few satan analogies

225
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.240
in marvel and they all hate each other
but

226
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.240
yes mafesto is the big one he was
fighting franklin richards son of reed

227
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.720
richards from the fantastic four
and franklin's like super powerful and

228
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.040
he managed to split mephisto's soul into
six

229
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.199
fragments with mephisto himself only
possessing one-sixth of his power

230
00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:42.800
sounds like a certain lord of the
voldemort variety like many things jk

231
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.759
rowling writes it appears in the comic
book decades earlier

232
00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:49.600
and all the while wanda and the west
coast avengers have been fighting a

233
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.399
villain named master pandemonium
a man who after a car crash made a deal

234
00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:57.519
with mephisto
to do his bidding as long as he could

235
00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.560
survive
mephisto decides he's going to replace

236
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.399
this guy's arms and legs with
demons and that in order to keep his

237
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:07.040
abilities master pandemonium has to
reclaim the

238
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.959
five fragments of his soul
which have been lost in the car crash

239
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:16.880
you see mephisto the king of lies
was deceiving master pandemonium into

240
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.399
finding his own soul fragments
because he didn't want all of hell to

241
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:24.800
know that he'd lost so much of his
power two of these soul fragments were

242
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.440
the children of the scarlet witch which
is how we get

243
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.279
baby arms right master pandemonium
while the scarlet witch was distracted

244
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:36.880
snuck into her house and absorbed her
babies into him which

245
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.800
mephisto then proceeded to absorb back
into himself to regain his full power

246
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.680
which master pandemonium was not happy
about but

247
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.000
then the breaks so then billy and tommy
sol somehow managed to be distributed

248
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.440
back into the world as
two children in the greater manhattan

249
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.880
area
well kind of first what happened is

250
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.240
agatha erased all of wanda's memories of
her children which

251
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.600
kind of worked but she still ended up
going into a brief spiral

252
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.199
cue the rest of the avengers who were
like why is this happening

253
00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.400
and because they all collectively get
the world's worst friend award

254
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.480
they basically just ignore her grief
ignore her in general

255
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.760
which allowed magneto to step in and
offer her fatherly support in this

256
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.559
trying time
but instead he uses her to help him

257
00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.039
create a new brotherhood of evil mutants
because of course he does

258
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:27.360
but this doesn't even matter because the
whole thing was a ploy by immortus

259
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.760
so that he could use her to safeguard
the earth 616 timeline the

260
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.760
normal marvel comics timeline from
converging with other timelines and

261
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.120
alternate realities
he planned to put wanda into an eternal

262
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.480
hypnotic trance
so that he could use her as a nexus

263
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.960
being and by proxy of her
he could choose which timeline was true

264
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.160
and filter out which ones were false
the whole ordeal with the vision wanda's

265
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.600
children the vision's dismemberment
her ensuing mental duress and now

266
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.720
magneto's ploy
was all puppeteered by a mortis

267
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.679
so he could have wanda in this state of
emotional fragility

268
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:11.840
it was during this time while under the
control of immortus by proxy of magneto

269
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.440
that she briefly created a reality where
she still had her children

270
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.440
demonstrating that she didn't even
really need mephisto's power to do this

271
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.360
it's believed that it was at this point
that the twin souls were sent out to two

272
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.120
separate expecting mothers
meaning that they are the children of

273
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.679
the scarlet witch and not
actually shards of mephisto now

274
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:36.000
maybe it's not clear don't think too
much about it because marvel hasn't

275
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.080
really made a convincing explanation
or any explanation i mean i could make

276
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.840
one that's convincing marvel call me and
all of this took place from the 1970s to

277
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.600
the early 1990s
eventually in the 2005 mini-series

278
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.120
avengers disassembled
wanda got her memories back it was none

279
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.440
too pleased that the avengers took them
from her

280
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.280
and blamed them for the loss of her
children in her rage

281
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.760
she killed multiple avengers before
falling into a catatonic state

282
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.880
and being whisked away by magneto for
safe keeping

283
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.559
before this breakdown though she'd
actually met a bullied young teenager

284
00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:12.320
named billy
who idolized her what wanda hadn't

285
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.559
realized was that this boy
was the reincarnated soul of one of her

286
00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:20.720
lost sons
who once the avengers disbanded after

287
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.000
the events have disassembled
went on to help create a new team

288
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.480
of young avengers
[Music]

289
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.559
we meet billy and teddy as we know them
today in young avengers issue number one

290
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:43.360
released in april of 2005 immediately
after wanda's major breakdown

291
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.360
the pair have joined the young avengers
in hopes of picking up the slack left

292
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.320
behind after the avengers proper
disbanded

293
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.760
the team is originally comprised of
wiccan hulkling

294
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.400
kate bishop patriot and iron lad later
on in this run the team would also be

295
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.200
joined by cassie lang ant-man's daughter
a young version of the vision and tommy

296
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.880
wanda's other son
their first story sees them facing kang

297
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.559
the conqueror with advanced knowledge
from the time traveling iron lad

298
00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:17.200
who is actually a young version of kang
who is a younger version of immortus

299
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.120
i never said this got simpler the
biggest news getter of this initial run

300
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.840
was of course the introduction of billy
and teddy

301
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.799
we didn't know that they were the
ultimate power couple just yet but they

302
00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:30.159
were a teenage gay couple smack dab in
the middle of a marvel comic

303
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:34.480
so they got a lot of attention that
almost wasn't the case though

304
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.080
when alan heinberg the creator of the
team initially pitched the idea to

305
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.280
marvel execs they
weren't too fond of the idea of having a

306
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.200
gay couple in an avengers title
in fact word came down from isaac

307
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.880
perlmutter the reclusive ceo of marvel
known for being an arch-conservative

308
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.720
racist homophobe
that there should absolutely not be a

309
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.240
gay couple
in an avengers title they did like the

310
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.400
idea of a young hulk and thor though
billy's original superhero title was the

311
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.000
asgardian
so the compromise was that teddy

312
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.919
hulkling
being a shapeshifter would actually be a

313
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.880
girl
who shifts into the big tough hulkling

314
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.559
when it's time to fight
this is the only reason that wicked and

315
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.480
hulkling actually made it into
publication

316
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.080
but there was a wrinkle see ellen
heinberg was a well-known gay writer who

317
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.440
had written for sex in the city
so when word got out that he'd be

318
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.280
writing the new avengers series
the gay press interviewed him as much as

319
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.960
possible and he made sure to tell them
that he would be writing a

320
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.600
gay couple so now the media was flush
with stories about how marvel would be

321
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.039
featuring gay avengers and how awesome
and progressive marvel was

322
00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:42.880
they practically got handed a glad award
before a single page was printed

323
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.120
so now marvel editorial was in a pickle
keep going with the agreed-upon

324
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.840
shape-shifter angle or revert to the
original idea and have gay characters

325
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.039
one decision would massively piss off
their ceo

326
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:58.720
but the other would massively piss off a
segment of the population that was

327
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.760
currently making queers folk the most
expensive show on tv to buy ads for gays

328
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.799
have a lot of buying power you see with
the whole no children thing

329
00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:10.720
so they decided that teddy would remain
a boy

330
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.720
oops but then word came down from
perlmutter to stop the run at six issues

331
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.840
he would not have gays queering up his
comics

332
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.440
bit of an overreaction considering billy
and teddy were only a small part of a

333
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.159
large ensemble team
the thing is though money trumps hate

334
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:29.440
almost
every time and when the pre-sale numbers

335
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.720
came in for the young avengers the run
was extended to 12.

336
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.159
and this time with leverage alan
heinberg decided that he'd make these

337
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.960
six
issues all about billy and teddy's

338
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.080
relationship
the super skrull arrives and kills

339
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.280
teddy's mom
after revealing to teddy that she wasn't

340
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.559
in fact his birth mother
refer back to the cree scrawl war

341
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:53.440
shenanigans now
the super scrub not important the super

342
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.000
scroll
is a skrull who was made to fight the

343
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.400
fantastic four on top of being a
shapeshifter he also has the abilities

344
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.240
of the fantastic four
an insane amount of things were actually

345
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.520
introduced in that fantastic four
that would later have importance in

346
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.200
other areas of marvel
this created a problem for disney when

347
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.200
fox owned the team as that meant a very
wide range of characters that were

348
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.080
important to the rest of marvel
actually belonged to fox which is why we

349
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.880
didn't get captain marvel until disney
bought fox

350
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.039
furthermore super skrull himself isn't
very well known he doesn't have an

351
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:31.200
interesting publication history and
he actually isn't really that important

352
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.640
and why are we talking about him
even though marvel continues to publish

353
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.960
him without any backstory
as if we ought to know who he is okay

354
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.520
i'm finished
anyway the super skrull kills teddy's

355
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.000
mom but then feels bad about it
after the cree armada show up on earth

356
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.880
to kidnap teddy and take him back to the
kree empire

357
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.360
where he will be the prince of space the
skrulls also want him though

358
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.279
and a mini episode of game of thrones
plays out until the super skrull agrees

359
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.840
to
shapeshift into teddy and submit himself

360
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.440
to the invading forces
so that teddy can stay on earth with

361
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.679
billy and his friends
after this run completed again with

362
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:11.279
fantastic sales
marvel editorial wanted heinberg back to

363
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:14.240
do more
but he was a bit busy producing episodes

364
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.440
of grey's anatomy and writing wonder
woman for dc he'd eventually go on to

365
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.640
write the good wonder woman movie
so there was a long period in which

366
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.840
marvel would insert the young avengers
especially billy and teddy

367
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.039
into other titles in order to draw
attention and sales

368
00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:31.279
secret invasion civil war dark rain
siege if there was a marvel event worth

369
00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.440
reading
our boys made it into the pages

370
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.919
somewhere finally in 2010 heinberg
agreed to come back to marvel to write

371
00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:41.279
the children's crusade
a direct sequel to his young avengers

372
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.440
run that would also bring back the
scarlet witch after five years of not

373
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.720
being in publication
in this series magneto learns that the

374
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.039
young avengers are going to search for
wanda

375
00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:54.960
who had vanished after the events of
house of m when she completely rewrote

376
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.320
reality to give everyone their best life
and eventually eliminated the vast

377
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.080
majority of mutants from the marvel
universe

378
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.000
magneto also learns that wiccan and
speed are reincarnations of wanda's

379
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.480
children
he tracks them down and informs them

380
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.240
that he is their grandfather
and that he's going to help them find

381
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.159
wanda because
he wants to try and be a good dad now

382
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:18.159
they do eventually find her or
so they think but the avengers attempt

383
00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:22.080
to apprehend her before wiccan teleports
magneto wanda and the young avengers to

384
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.120
wundegor mountain they soon realize
though that the scarlet witch is

385
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.120
actually a doombot
robots made by doctor doom in case that

386
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.400
was an obvious prompting the young
avengers and magneto to journey to

387
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.440
latveria with the avengers following
close behind

388
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.520
wiccan eventually finds the real wanda
apparently devoid of her powers without

389
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.440
any memory of her life
and engaged to marry dr doom but of

390
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.760
course it turns out that dr doom only
wants wanda for her incredible power

391
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.520
and has been keeping her lost in a brain
fog until he could figure out

392
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.679
how to transfer the power to himself he
finally manages this

393
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:59.919
a battle ensues he's defeated and it's
revealed that he was controlling wanda

394
00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:03.279
when she committed the horrible acts of
avengers disassembled

395
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:08.080
because if wanda is doing something bad
she is absolutely

396
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.679
being controlled by someone else always
this was also alan heinberg's way of

397
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:16.640
retconing the scarlet witch into being a
hero again

398
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.760
since he'd idolized the character since
he was a kid

399
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.360
what he's gay gay stan the scarlet witch
i don't make the rules

400
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.400
though the avengers offer to let her
rejoin their team

401
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.600
she rejects them stating that after
years of defining herself as magneto's

402
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.080
daughter
quicksilver's sister or the vision's

403
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.120
wife she wants to find out
who she is on her own terms the only

404
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.360
label she does embrace is mother
wrapping her arms around the children

405
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.600
she never knew
this was actually one of stan lee's

406
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.080
favorite moments in marvel comics
along with the death of gwen stacy as

407
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.600
the decades-long saga of the scarlet
witch finally ends with her being

408
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.360
allowed to just be happy
the saga of the young avengers is left

409
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.400
wide open and the series ends
with an image that's become so iconic

410
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.720
you've probably seen it even if you've
never held a comic book in your life

411
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.799
billy and teddy having been through so
much finally kiss

412
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:17.520
a full page panel making comic book
history and creating a generation of

413
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.799
shippers across the internet and around
the world

414
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:24.960
the young avengers would return a few
years later now written by kieran gillen

415
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.159
here it is revealed that not only is
teddy the king of space

416
00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:32.559
but billy is the demiurge the sentient
life force of earth's biosphere that

417
00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:35.120
seeded the earth with pieces of its own
essence

418
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.279
giving birth to the elder gods eons ago
essentially the creator of all life on

419
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:44.320
earth
so we have the king of space and the

420
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.799
embodiment of life itself
and there are a couple only in comics

421
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:54.080
but this run didn't sell as well as the
originals

422
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.919
whether it was disinterest in the
storytelling style the fall of comic

423
00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:02.240
book stores or the fact that marvel
didn't market it worth a damn

424
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.600
didn't really matter it was enough
reason for pearl mudder who was already

425
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.600
losing his grasp over marvel to disney
to shove billy and teddy to the

426
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.760
sidelines while most of the other young
avengers got solo titles or were

427
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.240
featured prominently in other teams
billy and teddy were mostly ignored

428
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.200
they'd pop up here there
but never make a real impression

429
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.120
until they recently became media
darlings once again when 15 years after

430
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.720
their introduction
they became featured players in 2020's

431
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.200
empire storyline
in this teddy literally does become the

432
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.159
king or
should i say emperor of space coronated

433
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:41.039
null
and though the imperial court was not

434
00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:44.480
altogether pleased with his relationship
with billy forbidding it at first

435
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.440
because billy's from earth not because
they're gay they did eventually have a

436
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.960
giant
royal wedding in the middle of space a

437
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.480
happily ever after
for marvel's premier gay couple

438
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:05.839
but is it really
[Music]

439
00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:10.080
so one thing i talk a lot about in my
videos is the representation of queer

440
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.440
people in media
marvel has had a bumpy road actually

441
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.320
presenting us
queer characters that stick around

442
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.440
there's been a few previously
established characters at marvel coming

443
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.440
out over the last couple of years
on top of existing bisexuals like dawkin

444
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.799
wolverine sun
and deadpool hercules was alluded to be

445
00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:30.399
bisexual in the past and is now in a
same-sex romance with novar

446
00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:35.120
also a young avenger wolverine himself
is bisexual in an alternate universe and

447
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.360
colossus is gay in an alternate universe
alternate universe being important

448
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.559
contexts here iceman both the old and
young version

449
00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:45.919
were outed as full on gay in a storyline
that

450
00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:52.080
some found touching and some found toxic
basically jean grey a psychic outs him

451
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.720
to
himself this was mostly a parting [ __ ]

452
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.840
you from brian michael bendis
who had been trying to add queer

453
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.559
characters to marvel comics for years
but pearl mudder wouldn't let him so as

454
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:06.880
he was fixing to leave the company
he made a mainline x-men character gay

455
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.320
and following the
outline made by heinberg whipped up a

456
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.960
storm of publicity about it so that
marvel would

457
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.360
receive maximum backlash if they tried
to shove him back into the closet

458
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.559
tommy scarlet witch's other son is also
now

459
00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:24.640
gay or bisexual and in a relationship
with prodigy who at one point tried to

460
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.080
snatch teddy away from billy
america chavez is a lesbian also you

461
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.919
keep forgetting about that other
x-men the new one the little green one

462
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:36.000
whose straight friend misses new
opportunity

463
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.360
to bring up his sexuality yeah what's
his name

464
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.640
i couldn't tell you which is part of the
problem right

465
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.480
marvel loves pushing identity but not
personality

466
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.559
you may hear about any number of queer
marvel characters on whatever geek.com

467
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.360
website but
they quickly fade into obscurity once

468
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.519
the sales bump has flattened
the press has gone away and marvel

469
00:30:57.519 --> 00:31:00.720
shifts back to focusing on iron man
spider-man and wolverine

470
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.559
at the end of the day it's also
disingenuous

471
00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:07.760
beyond that it seems to be presenting
queerness with a heteronormative

472
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.399
objective
that is when queer characters are

473
00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:14.559
presented as queer
either from being outed or from being

474
00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:18.159
out upon creation
the objective seems to be to make them

475
00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:22.480
as straight as possible
that way they're queer but they don't

476
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.120
offend the straights
and this isn't just a thing in comic

477
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.120
books queer characters
seem to always have their queerness

478
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.200
revolve around another character
you see this a lot in television where

479
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.960
given that a cast will usually only have
maybe two gay characters

480
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.200
they will inevitably be drawn together
it's the media version of oh my god i

481
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.000
have a gay friend you'd be perfect
together this idea is so

482
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.039
permeative in culture that many queer
people

483
00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:50.320
try to force themselves into a
relationship with potentially toxic

484
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.919
partners
because they think the only way to

485
00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:58.480
properly be queer
is to be mated with a fellow queer

486
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.480
and due to the fact that the gatekeepers
of media are still largely heterosexual

487
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.600
white men
when they do deign to present queer

488
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.039
characters their limited
understanding of queer identity is

489
00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:14.080
exclusively linked to white
cis gay relationships rather than the

490
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.640
internal process of thinking outside of
the hetero-hegemony the queer people

491
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.080
gay cis men and women specifically are
being badgered into

492
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.159
which don't get me wrong many people
earnestly do want to get married and

493
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:29.360
have a
normal white picket fence life with you

494
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.039
know two and a half kids and a dog
the problem is that this kind of

495
00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:37.519
suburbanization is favorable
to corporate interests as people like

496
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:40.480
this are easy to develop marketing
strategies for

497
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.559
specifically mortgages loans cars and
other domestic products needed to keep

498
00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:48.640
up with the joneses
as someone who works in marketing i know

499
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.360
that my fellow
straight sis marketers banged their

500
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.519
heads against the wall trying to figure
out

501
00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.880
how to appeal to the city queers they've
figured out the white sis gays

502
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.760
gaycations gay baby clothes and rainbows
rainbows rainbows but everyone else

503
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.960
well marketing executives look at every
other letter in the lgbtqia

504
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.200
2 plus spectrum and think uh they're
just too hard to sell to and they don't

505
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.600
have that much money anyway
and if there's no companies trying to

506
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.360
convince you to buy their stuff
there's not likely anyone making media

507
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.360
for you but they haven't given up
instead there is a vested corporate

508
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.159
interest in convincing queer people of
all shades

509
00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:29.919
to want the lifestyle they've already
figured out how to market to

510
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:33.120
come pride month if you're friends with
the right kind of people you'll hear

511
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.279
these friends call this phenomenon
rainbow capitalism and

512
00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:42.640
well there's a whole video on that
coming later another factor behind the

513
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.600
push to marry off gay characters in
fiction stems from the need to

514
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.240
de-sexualize queer characters
gay men especially keep in mind that the

515
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.480
gay panic of the 20th century was rooted
less in the idea that homosexuality was

516
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.799
unnatural
the real heart of these modern phobias

517
00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:03.440
stemmed from the idea that gay men would
use sex and gratuitous sexual pleasure

518
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.120
to corrupt otherwise proper citizens and
neighborhoods

519
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.879
it was called the lavender panic the
gays are coming for your husbands girls

520
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:14.560
but there's a separation between the
discrimination of gay men and gay women

521
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.839
lesbians are of course discriminated
against

522
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:21.520
but it's a bit different for gay men
specifically because cis gay men possess

523
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.280
the threat of penetration
though anal sex is far from the only act

524
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.240
the two gay men can get up to
it seems to be the only one that

525
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.599
straight people are obsessed with
whereas a homophobic person may have a

526
00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:35.119
hatred of lesbians
with gay men there is the threat of anal

527
00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:39.200
penetration
and as a result demasculinization

528
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.200
and even if a fictional character's sex
life never factors into the plot

529
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.280
or components of their personality the
idea of penetrative sex

530
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.440
still exist as a subliminal factor in
the viewer's mind

531
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.359
single gays therefore are not cute or
wholesome like their

532
00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:59.920
gay dad counterparts they are seen as
sexually deviant and especially after

533
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.760
the 1980s
threats to a person's health whereas

534
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.920
straight single characters are allowed
to be as

535
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.599
single and promiscuous as they come look
at wolverine iron man

536
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:13.040
she-hulk daredevil gambit spider-man i
mean the most

537
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.599
i've ever felt seen in a comic book was
dc's new 52 run of midnighter

538
00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.839
where he was literally on grindr having
on panel gay sex with hookups

539
00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:28.720
and living his best single life
i mean i wish that was my life

540
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.480
single gays men and women seem to
represent this kind of

541
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.720
freedom sexual and otherwise that older
creators and readers

542
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.599
are really uncomfortable with so now
that it's okay to get gay married

543
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.280
they can remove this element of freedom
by forcing them into a historically

544
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.240
heterosexual institution
suddenly scary gays are just like the

545
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.640
straits
in the same boring sexless marriages the

546
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.839
fight for equal rights and
representation should not be focused

547
00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:02.240
around convincing the heteros that
hey these outsiders are just like you

548
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.400
and that means they're okay
because then we're on a very slippery

549
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.200
slope when the hegemony
encounters an outsider who isn't just

550
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.920
like them
and making no attempt to be the outsider

551
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.000
is rejected
or pressured to assimilate the focus of

552
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.720
representation needs to be focusing on
appreciating individuals differences

553
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.920
rather than focusing on finding areas of
common ground

554
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.280
take billy and teddy for instance even
they fit the mold of

555
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.960
high school nerd and high school jock
they just happen to be gay

556
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.119
and superheroes but over the years as
more and more writers have gotten their

557
00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:43.760
hands on them
they've become only that gay superheroes

558
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.119
gay characters have their personalities
stripped away

559
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:50.400
i'm not sure whether it's because the
straight writers tend to view gay

560
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.079
as a personality or whether it's because
they're so occupied

561
00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:57.760
making the character presentable to
editors and audiences that they

562
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.640
forget to make them interesting as a
result the character is made to be as

563
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.720
sterile as possible so that the majority
straight white sis audience isn't

564
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.480
offended
think of it like how people say that

565
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.400
carol danvers is a [ __ ]
but tony stark is just snarky and

566
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.920
determined
traits as they are seen in straight

567
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.680
white cis men
are charming but they are more

568
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.599
negatively received
in women queer folk and characters of

569
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.320
color
something else that's very important is

570
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.400
how marvel and dc still sell their
comics to comic book stores

571
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.440
store owners get the feedback from the
customers they see

572
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.280
in store not necessarily the majority of
people who buy comics

573
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.400
especially now that they're available
widely through apps

574
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.520
the people you're most likely to see in
a comic book store

575
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.880
are heteronormative white guys in fact
the culture of most comic book stores is

576
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.320
considered so toxic
that readers who aren't white straight

577
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.800
guys have gravitated toward buying their
comics on apps like comixology to avoid

578
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.560
it
like full disclosure i used to follow

579
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.720
billy and teddy religiously when they
would pop into the background of a comic

580
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.040
i would buy it
and then i would invest in the whole

581
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.680
series they weren't even involved i was
just so starved for the characters

582
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.119
but the reason i kind of fell out of
touch with these guys is because i

583
00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:20.000
started to recognize
that they were essentially ciphers that

584
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.800
i was superimposing myself
onto as i developed as more of a

585
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.960
distinct person
i stopped identifying with these

586
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.760
characters because they were presented
in such broad strokes

587
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.680
that without me imagining myself in
their places billy specifically

588
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.880
and without an actual distinct
personality to reel me in

589
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.960
i didn't really have anything to keep me
interested and that's because when these

590
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.240
characters are written
at least most of the time they're not

591
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.040
being written by writers who love them
who want to expand upon their identities

592
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.400
and build a mythology around them
they're being written by writers for

593
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.359
whom they are just another wrong on the
ladder

594
00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:58.880
they want to write spider-man iron man
thor deadpool make the jump to dc and

595
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.480
write for batman
the characters they grew up idolizing

596
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.240
and because queer media is so starved
for representation

597
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.920
organizations like glaad will give an
award to any writer who features queer

598
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.119
characters
a nice feather in their cap and a quick

599
00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:16.560
boost to getting to the characters that
they actually want to write

600
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.240
looking back at billy and teddy's
publication there isn't a whole lot of

601
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.320
character there
except what the reader places upon them

602
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.920
we know for a fact that marvel is
uncomfortable with separating them

603
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.760
whenever you do see them apart they're
basically a tool to be used by a team

604
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.280
and nothing more there's no singular
development for them

605
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.320
they only really exist to be put back
together

606
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.000
so that they can be the gay couple
essentially they're

607
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.480
gays who are character baited when
straight creators write them

608
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.119
and characters like loki they write them
from their own heterosexual frames of

609
00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:54.240
reference
they have internalized the message of

610
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.200
they're just like me
and don't seem to make a significant

611
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.920
attempt to make them like
actual queer people and in this feedback

612
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.920
loop queer readers of comic books
develop their own concept of queerness

613
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.760
as what a straight creator
is trying to depict and when queer

614
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.520
creators are brought into marvel
they're given a quick stint with a given

615
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.599
character like chavez or iceman
and then when the title comes to an end

616
00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:20.480
they're quickly
shut out from any further role in the

617
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.520
company even as they're writing their
queer characters

618
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.800
they have editors breathing down their
necks making sure this is the most

619
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.359
palatable depiction of queerness
possible

620
00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:32.800
they can't authentically even tell
stories about their queer experience

621
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.040
because they have to write queerness
that is

622
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.760
directed at appealing
to homophobic editors meanwhile this

623
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.280
whole process focused
so hard on making gay men and women as

624
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.880
straight as possible
that we forgot to acknowledge that trans

625
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.200
people exist
and since media has focused on almost

626
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.960
exclusively portraying trans people who
fit the binary gender mold

627
00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.560
we're ignoring non-binary and
genderqueer people

628
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.680
society convinces us to take what is
different

629
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.800
and extraordinary about us and try to
hide it

630
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.000
so that we can be normal and ordinary
but

631
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.480
doing so we lose what makes us special
we lose our superpower because trust me

632
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.079
queer people have superpowers we have
the superior durability

633
00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:24.720
to withstand years of torment and abuse
we have the telepathy needed to find

634
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.800
each other no matter where we might be
we have the super strength needed to

635
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.079
fight back against systems set up to
crush us

636
00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:36.319
we have the power of mind control
influencing entire societies even when

637
00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:40.400
they don't acknowledge that we exist
we have the ability to transform and

638
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.000
become the people we were always meant
to be

639
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.599
and we have the power of regeneration to
close wounds believe too deep to heal

640
00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:53.760
and go on with our lives every queer
person who gets up in the morning and

641
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.760
goes out into the world is a superhero
we may not wear capes though some of us

642
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.079
might
but we accomplish shocking feats

643
00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:05.599
whether we're out and proud or hidden
surviving in a land that tries to

644
00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:08.800
exterminate us like so many of marvel's
x-men

645
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.640
we are amazing astounding fantastic
spectacular

646
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.920
super and i think people like that need
to

647
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.119
show up in comics or movies or tv shows
queer superheroes who are every bit as

648
00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.920
astounding in everyday life as they are
when they're fighting crime or saving

649
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.520
the world
it can be done maybe that will be the

650
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.880
mcu's billy and teddy
or maybe it's a hero yet to be created

651
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.000
by a queer artist using their power to
tell stories

652
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.760
maybe it's you because we all have a
superpower

653
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.760
and we need to use them to make life a
little bit easier for every queer kid

654
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.960
across the world who needs a hero to
look up to

655
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.119
i know it's a lot to take on but we have
to

656
00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:56.839
because as a great man once wrote
with great power comes great

657
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:59.839
responsibility
