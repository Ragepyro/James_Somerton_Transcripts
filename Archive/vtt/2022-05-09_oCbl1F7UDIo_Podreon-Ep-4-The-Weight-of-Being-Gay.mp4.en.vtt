00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.000

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.479
um probably wait until next week or go
listen to one of the last ones or go

16
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.880
watch the new
uh nintendo video that was just came out

17
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
yeah um
there's some really good goodies in that

18
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.920
video i i really like how the script
turned out

19
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.439
me too yeah getting a lot of comments on
the script actually a lot of people

20
00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.000
saying it's the best videos like we
haven't had a major discourse on gender

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.720
for quite some time no
and

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.960
like i feel like this video was a great
way to sort of get that discourse going

23
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.000
like using nintendo was kind of the
spring point for that

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.600
although there have been a couple of
people commenting that they're sick of

25
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.000
me ignoring asexuality and i'm like

26
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.720
i

27
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.000
mean videos are written by an asexual
person leave me alone

28
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.280
well like okay let's just take a moment
before we get into that i'm not asexual

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.360
uh i'm asexual um somewhat um
it's weird the ace spectrum there is a

30
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.560
lot of a spectrum and i'm in a lot of
different places on it um

31
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.760
just like
we're talking about properties that

32
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.000
don't and like we can't mention several
times they don't nintendo doesn't do sex

33
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.720
yeah except for bayonetta so it's
arguably everyone in on in in the

34
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.520
nintendo roster is asexual
yeah because it's just not brought up

35
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.599
um so it's hard to really have a
discourse about asexuality without

36
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.120
bringing sex to the center of the
discourse

37
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.400
at which point media that depicts
asexual people does not depict them

38
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.440
sexually so it's hard to really kind of
start that discourse going unless they

39
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.519
have a soapbox that step up on and talk
about why asexuality is valid which that

40
00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.920
media is few and far between yeah and
that's something that like we talk about

41
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.160
in the video is that it's nice that the
queerness is kind of there

42
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
on the periphery that it's not shoved in
your face and i'm actually seeing a bit

43
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.280
of a discourse among gay people
on social media regarding um heart

44
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.080
stopper which we've talked about before
yeah uh specifically about how

45
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.680
they hate that people are enjoying the
fact that it is a

46
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.040
non-sexualized gay story yeah which i've
been saying that is you know that's the

47
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.040
next step we need that we need but these
guys are saying that they hate it

48
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.319
because they feel like it's demonizing
gay sex

49
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.440
and it's i'm like
no

50
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.440
it's not demonizing gay sex it's just
saying you can be gay without sex being

51
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.480
the only thing on your mind yeah but
anyway

52
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.959
um those are different podcasts
uh this one we're talking about weight

53
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.080
and body image and if you follow me on
social media you know that the back

54
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.200
story
yeah but i'll kind of lay it out on the

55
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.799
line james lore uh james lore
james lore um

56
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.879
i have been overweight my entire life
like forever i saw my first dietitian

57
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.319
when i was six or seven i had just
started elementary school i was being

58
00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.159
made fun of for being fat and so my mom
was immediately like okay let's get him

59
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.519
to a dietician and you know nip this in
the bud didn't work

60
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.120
um
i've never been able to lose substantial

61
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.159
amounts of weight
and so

62
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.720
recently i decided to get weight loss
surgery i was going to get the

63
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.040
uh the thing that everyone hears about
is the lap band or the gastric bypass i

64
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.680
was getting something different i was
going to get a gastric sleeve i'll

65
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.600
explain the difference in a moment
um that's

66
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600
probably for like surgery-related stuff
because the gastric bypass freaks me out

67
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600
like just yeah with what they do with
that

68
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.840
um
but uh

69
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.000
so i decided to go for that i was gonna
go through a private clinic

70
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.560
um in ontario so it would involve flying
to get the surgery um

71
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.759
and i had it scheduled i put down a down
payment on the surgery and everything

72
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.440
because i had done lots and lots of
research into the surgery mostly doctors

73
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.960
talking about it and so i felt like okay
doctors know what they're talking about

74
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.720
so you know getting a good idea of what
the surgery is what kind of

75
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.759
complications there are seemed like
there weren't a whole lot of

76
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.800
complications
possible

77
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.560
and then i started okay let me
look after after i had paid the deposit

78
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.479
i said okay let me look up some like
testimonials from people who had gotten

79
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.600
it and oh the horror stories i found
yeah um

80
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.680
of people
being in extreme pain because they have

81
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.080
to you know it's it's stomach surgery so
they have to fill your stomach cavity

82
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.720
with gas
um

83
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.039
to blow it up so that they can like move
around and move around because this one

84
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.240
specifically is not a non-invasive
surgery they just poke holes in your

85
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.960
stomach yeah
um

86
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.160
so they
blow you kind of blow you up so they

87
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.960
have room to move around but apparently
they don't really

88
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.600
take the gas out when they're done yeah
and so your body is filled with gas and

89
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.639
i had heard about this earlier and i
thought it was gas pain as in like

90
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.720
indigestion gas pain but no apparently
this is gas bubbles moving around your

91
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.759
body pushing against nerves and
everything and it can last for months

92
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.520
and months and months did not know this
i'm not good with pain

93
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.639
um
i took three tylenol before this podcast

94
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.240
just because i had a minorist of
headaches

95
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.840
um
and so i found that out different things

96
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.400
like uh permanent heartburn for the rest
of your life ongoing nausea ongoing

97
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.039
nausea nausea
[Laughter]

98
00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.240
no it's pronounced nausea on the show i
thought it was pronounced naughty no

99
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.880
it's nausea okay well i think it's to
kind of play off of nausea

100
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.520
ongoing nausea
um and all sorts of things that i found

101
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.960
out and i was
i was fine with

102
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.720
the surgery the pain immediately after
surgery

103
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.319
because the surgery i'm not like a lap
band is when they they go in and

104
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.039
basically put a zip tie a fancy zip tie
around a part of your stomach to make it

105
00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.680
harder for food to get through and so
you feel fuller faster a gastric bypass

106
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.520
is where they actually go in and
completely re-root your stomach and your

107
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.440
intestines and everything um what i was
going to get done was called a gastric

108
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.319
sleeve
and that's when they go in

109
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.639
and they remove three quarters of your
stomach and

110
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.759
if you if you know what a stomach looks
like it's kind of like a bag

111
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.319
and they make it into a banana shape
and roughly the size of a banana so that

112
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.240
you get full really fast
um

113
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.720
and
because of the part of the stomach they

114
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.360
remove they remove a part that secretes
a hormone called ghrelin and that's

115
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.800
actually the hunger hormone it makes you
hungry ghrelin sounds like an old

116
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.560
english monster it doesn't like you're
like

117
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.520
grendel's like angry brother yeah um
but

118
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.080
so if your stomach is empty it secretes
ghrelin and makes you feel hungry and

119
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.520
once this thing is covered it's with
food

120
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.759
you no longer feel hungry and so they
remove that part so you don't have the

121
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.440
hunger hormone going on
um do you think closeted gays in like

122
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.440
the 1100s england shipped beowulf and
grendel

123
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.039
i'm interested to see that fan art

124
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.800
anyway
um

125
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.800
so that that and then they you know they
take the remainder of the stomach out

126
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.120
and you have a tiny stomach for the rest
of your life which makes it so that

127
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.960
you lose a lot of weight very quickly um
but you know people within a year can

128
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.279
lose like 150 pounds because the stomach
is elastic like it will grow back to

129
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.560
it will never grow back to the size full
size but it will expand a little bit

130
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.440
you'll be able to kind of resume a
normal life but it is a bit of a

131
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.800
commitment at first and you will need to
be on like lifelong vitamins so like i

132
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.839
was fine yeah you were fine with that
you were even flying for like a week or

133
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.959
two of like the gas pain that they were
talking about which is apparently

134
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:53.360
similar to gallstones yeah that it's
basically

135
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.560
compare it to gallstones
women

136
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.959
compare it to labor yeah to labor um and
women who have got the procedure said

137
00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:06.399
that it felt like labor for like but all
over your body for weeks and months yeah

138
00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:09.519
um and you were fine with putting up
with that you were fine with the pills

139
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:13.279
for shorts about time oh yeah yeah like
two weeks like because i'm like okay

140
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:17.600
they're gonna be giving me painkillers
anyway so i'll be able to handle it um

141
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.240
so yeah i found out all of this stuff
that no doctor had talked about and that

142
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.200
sometimes the painkillers just don't
work

143
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.880
you mentioned that too well yeah because
it it's the pain is so extreme that the

144
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.839
painkillers don't work that uh there was
one woman giving a testimonial where

145
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.720
they
um

146
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.519
uh she was having so much gas pain
uh and again this isn't like gas pain

147
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:45.519
from indigestion this it had gone to her
shoulders gas bubbles in her body yeah

148
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.720
it had gone to the back of her shoulders
so she could not lay down so she

149
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.760
couldn't sleep um
and so what she actually had to do is go

150
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.680
to the emergency room because she was in
so much pain an event

151
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.560
after i think she said it was 13 hours
and not 13 hours waiting 13 hours seeing

152
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.600
doctors that they finally gave her a
nerve block

153
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.079
um which is where they inject a thing
into your spinal cord column that just

154
00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:14.560
like you cannot feel pain
um and that's what she had to do

155
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.880
and it last my dad used to get those i
think he might still get them actually

156
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.480
they last for about three months
uh when it started wearing off the pain

157
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.279
was still there
so she is in

158
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:29.440
chronic pain forever for the rest of her
life but she's skinny but she is in

159
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.880
chronic pain for the rest of her
um

160
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.079
and so
i decided

161
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:39.839
okay i've put down a thousand dollars on
this surgery

162
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.040
um
like i will swallow that thousand

163
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.360
dollars
and

164
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.240
you know get the plane tickets and all
that refunded

165
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.880
and
i will

166
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.399
postpone the surgery
because

167
00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:59.040
i have huge health anxiety
and the fact that there was there is no

168
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.160
matter what surgery it if it's if it's
tonsil if you're getting your tonsils

169
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.279
removed the doctor will not say that
there's a zero percent chance of you

170
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:10.720
dying on the operating table yeah and
that just made me panic because it's not

171
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.360
a doctor saying you need james you need
this surgery or you will die this is

172
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.320
saying doc this is me saying i want this
surgery for convenience sake yeah so

173
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.760
that i don't have to
so that i can't not diet yeah my stomach

174
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.839
will not allow me to not diet yeah um
and just like leading up to that there

175
00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.279
were like you were kind of gung-ho for
it and then like

176
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:37.760
as soon as they gave me a uh
a surgery date i was i had the hotel

177
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.279
booked i had a car booked i had
everything booked ready to go um

178
00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:47.200
and i hadn't even told my father yet i
had everything booked two days leading

179
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.800
up to
um yesterday so this was probably about

180
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.079
friday is when you started to get really
kind of tense about it and i was like

181
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:57.839
james what's wrong and you're like i'm
just saying it's just about the surgery

182
00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:01.680
i'm like okay like i get it surgery like
you go under i've gone under four wisdom

183
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.839
teeth i've never gotten under i've never
had surgery it is a weird sort of

184
00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:10.639
feeling like i'm going to be forcibly
unconscious yeah um and these people

185
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:14.399
will have metal things in my body yeah
like i've never had surgery so that's

186
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:17.760
that's a bit of a freakout thing like
your first time so i was like yeah james

187
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760
is going to go with i just need to
reassure him

188
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.600
so like you know you kind of kept
spiraling and i was like

189
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.360
okay we need to figure out what's what
so i sat on the couch and i had a white

190
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.079
board where i had pros and cons and this
was after um

191
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:35.440
this was after a night where i stayed up
all night panicking right right

192
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.320
eventually in tears at about eight
o'clock in the morning because i

193
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.120
couldn't sleep because i just had this
image in my head of me doing this

194
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.480
voluntary procedure
of my own volition

195
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.560
dying on the operating table and my dad
getting the call

196
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.440
that six months after his wife had died
his son had died yeah

197
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.800
and like that that hit a bit raw but
like from the very beginning i've been

198
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.399
very supportive of the decision to get
the surgery like you've been more

199
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:08.160
supportive than
anyone else the only other person who

200
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.519
was like
on board was my mom yeah and i've had to

201
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:15.920
convince some of your friends um i had
to convince you know people i knew be

202
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.680
like you know this i get it
so everyone's like no no it's all about

203
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.480
learning to love yourself and inner
beauty and like yeah that the grinder

204
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.000
doesn't give a [ __ ] about that well
that's your destination about grade 11.

205
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.200
i'm not you know you think that is a
superficial thing but it's also like

206
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.720
you've never
not been as big as you are

207
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.200
i mean like you've been bigger
uh i've been bigger and when i was much

208
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.880
younger i was smaller yeah but like i've
never

209
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.839
experienced
here is something i have never

210
00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:47.519
experienced for context for everyone
listening

211
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:52.079
never in my life
have i gone into a store

212
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:56.240
found
uh something i liked a jacket a shirt a

213
00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.880
pair of pants
and could just buy it yeah

214
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.240
never have i experienced my size just
existing yeah which the thing is i'm not

215
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.920
that big yeah like i know people much
bigger than me much bigger than me

216
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.800
um there are so many people like
in the youtube comments and stuff who

217
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.959
like
when we're doing live streams and stuff

218
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:22.639
they're like you're getting you want to
get weight loss surgery why

219
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.079
and
because i'm not that big

220
00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:32.160
i am just slightly bigger than xl and
because of that it's impossible for me

221
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.839
to buy clothing that's not impossible
but very difficult just just because

222
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:39.839
you're slightly bigger than a xl means
that you're too small for like big and

223
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:43.839
tall stores
yeah so that's a really significant

224
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:47.120
problem unless you just want to get all
of your clothes custom made which is

225
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.320
can't afford that yeah uh we're doing
well we're not doing that well

226
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.680
yeah i ain't getting i i don't have
custom clothes money yeah

227
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.079
i i have i can pay my rent and pay my
car

228
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:04.800
and eat
and pay an employee

229
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.680
yeah yeah
uh i mean like me personally oh okay

230
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.399
okay
so like

231
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:15.440
i and like i we've i've lifted you for
like what seven years at this point

232
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.880
um since 2015. seven years
yeah yeah seven and a half years okay

233
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.079
um
so like i've kind of been there and at

234
00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:30.000
first i was like no no it's all about
confidence and like you got to laugh

235
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.639
yourself and like i have i've seen you
pull the stops and

236
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.880
i've seen how rough it can get for you
yeah um just in terms of that because

237
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.320
i've been there so i'm like i get it i
get why you want to be free of that kind

238
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.600
of style of living i mean like we all
kind of have those albatrosses and it's

239
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.480
like if you have
a surgery that can get rid of that

240
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.720
albatross or magic wand or a button that
can get rid of that albatross and i say

241
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.639
do it because life is too short to waste
on like you know just waiting and that's

242
00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:03.600
really how
weight loss surgery is kind of

243
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.600
marketed
as a kind of magic button yeah it's like

244
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.000
they they say like this is not a magic
button you do have to eat properly after

245
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.120
the surgery you can't go you know
eat nothing but kfc because even though

246
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.120
your stomach is really small you can't
just gorge on high calorie food

247
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.199
and like i was perfectly fine with that
i was ready and am ready to completely

248
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:30.320
change my relationship with food
uh that's an interesting book title

249
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.759
honestly oh i'm sure it exists like
change your relationship with food not a

250
00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:38.880
title but like a subtitle like a tagline
but um like i am completely and was and

251
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.480
am completely ready to do that um
and it was like i needed

252
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.279
i felt like i needed the surgery
so that there was no going back

253
00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.120
specifically i wanted that surgery
because there's no reversing that you

254
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.160
can reverse the sleeve or you can
reverse the gastric bypass you can

255
00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.079
reverse the
um band the lap band you cannot reverse

256
00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.959
the sleeve because they are removing
three quarters of your stomach not just

257
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:08.160
that throwing it away i i've seen you
do the diet i've seen you try to diet

258
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.760
i've seen
uh i've seen you do super exercise time

259
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.720
and i've seen you do like follow all the
diet apps where it's like eat this many

260
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.120
calories and do this much exercise
and like it just wasn't having much

261
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.199
effect yeah
and my thing is that

262
00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:29.760
when i'm eating even relatively healthy
i do not gain weight i maintain weight

263
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:36.080
yeah um
my even and that's even having fast food

264
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.840
once in a while
um

265
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.720
and

266
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:48.480
for a time i was using an injection um
that

267
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.320
it's it's a weight loss injection
but what it really does it makes you

268
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.400
feel
sick

269
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.559
uh it constantly gives you nosh it makes
you feel nauseous all day

270
00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:01.919
um
and so you don't want to eat and so when

271
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:06.400
i was doing that
and i didn't want to eat i lost almost

272
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.240
30 pounds yeah
in the span of about three weeks

273
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.559
so that kind of tells me that my body's
ready to drop the weight

274
00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:18.320
i just need to
kind of kick it in with the injections

275
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.840
like did was it a plateau or was that
when you stopped taking them as

276
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.200
frequently i stopped taking them because
they were really

277
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.000
affecting my breathing okay because that
is one of the side effects is that

278
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.320
um and you're already asthmatic so yeah
that you can have an allergic reaction

279
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.720
to them where it affects your breathing
and you stuck through it anyway

280
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.080
well i did i went on it for weeks and
dealt with the not being able to breathe

281
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.280
because i wanted to lose weight and then
i went off of them and instead of going

282
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.960
off of them and returning to a normal
way of eating i went off of them and did

283
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.320
mcdonald's every day yeah um
because i'm not being judgey because i

284
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.360
did i ate that same mcdonald's as you
did

285
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.880
um
and you know it was take out every day

286
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.320
and that's what happened
um

287
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.600
and so
i know i can lose weight

288
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.640
but what i basically need to do to kind
of kick my metabolism into gear

289
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.280
is
starve it well yeah because we were

290
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.960
talking about it like kind of like i was
talking about we were on the couch and

291
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.480
kind of like that's when you really
started laying out like what all the

292
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.520
research you had done to it to it is and
i was kind of sitting there like oh i

293
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.280
thought this was just james anxiety but
like this is actually like it's serious

294
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.360
and that and there's a reason why
surgery yeah the the gastric surgeries

295
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.360
and so like i realize there's a reason
why you need to be heavy enough why

296
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.320
there is a you know
bottom cap

297
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.520
well yeah because like i was going
through a private clinic

298
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.919
um and i just met the weight the bmi
requirement

299
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.400
um
because

300
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:58.160
the bmi if you're under 35
bmi of 35 they will not look at you

301
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.080
unless you have comorbidities yeah i
don't have comorbidities but they're in

302
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.559
my family um heart disease diabetes
there is a history of that

303
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:12.080
and so that's why they accepted me for
surgery

304
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.919
um you have to be over a bmi of 40.
i think it's 40 for the government to

305
00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.480
pay for
your

306
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.640
your weight loss surgery and then it's
you know you're put on a wait list for a

307
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.360
decade depending upon what province
you're in

308
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.520
um
and so the only reason that i met their

309
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.039
minimum cap was because
i have

310
00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:39.200
a family history of heart disease and
diabetes if that wasn't there i wouldn't

311
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.960
have been
qualified for it and so like uh when i

312
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.400
was uh sort of getting out is that you
know like we were kind of sitting down

313
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.320
and i was i i who had been supportive of
you know the surgery the entire time i

314
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.120
don't want to kind of influence you one
way or the other but like you were kind

315
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.720
of laying out the side effects to me and
i was like this is really really really

316
00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.720
bad and the more we got talking about it
you kind of brought up the kind of

317
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.320
pre-surgery diet that you have to go on
yeah which is a liquid diet that you

318
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.360
have to be on for two weeks and you said
that some of the testimonials said that

319
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.600
oh excuse me that um a lot of people
lost a mat like half the weight they

320
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.200
were supposed to lose just from the
liquid diet well yeah one person in

321
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.679
particular
um

322
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:23.919
they went on the liquid diet they gave
the the clinic a really bad review

323
00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:27.280
because they lost i think it was 50
pounds

324
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.039
just off of the liquid diet two weeks
three weeks for that they were on it for

325
00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.919
three weeks
they lost 50 pounds in three weeks and

326
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:37.520
then when they got the surgery they
didn't lose any weight yeah because

327
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.000
they had just lost 50 pounds
um

328
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.960
and you know liquid diets have been a
thing for decades and decades and

329
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.000
decades they're not sustainable yeah um
your body cannot handle

330
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.360
being on a liquid diet for a long period
of time

331
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.480
um
so like the bottom line is like we kind

332
00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.480
of went over that and we're like why
don't we just try that and i say we but

333
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.440
like you know like
i i say we because i'm going to help

334
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.559
it's among many things that i'm going to
try because basically my my mission now

335
00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:13.679
is to get down to
is to show a marked weight loss by the

336
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:17.520
end of the year
not 10 or 15 pounds

337
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.440
not 30 pounds
because i lost 30 pounds on the

338
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:28.559
injections i want to see the weight loss
in the mirror yeah um

339
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:33.280
and
if i can see that by the end of the year

340
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.880
then i will continue
you know just eating healthy exercise

341
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.919
etc um
and you know get to where i want to be

342
00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:46.400
if not i will return
for the

343
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.039
surgery yeah next year
um

344
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.440
and
my hope is that i won't be going back

345
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.840
for surgery
that a more natural mess yeah like i i'm

346
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.000
i'm gonna be a bit strict with this like
i really want you to kind of commit to

347
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.360
this because like dieting is hard for
people who like food um

348
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.720
that's the thing i don't
like oh my god so like james is gonna

349
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.760
have to go in for the surgery he's kind
of telling me all of the food he can't

350
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.000
eat and like one of them is carbs and
like i just got back into bread making i

351
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.840
make cookies all the time i love making
food i love feeding people

352
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:32.080
i started crying
yeah like i don't care about food like i

353
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.120
like food but it's like
for instance years ago when i was god i

354
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.679
was only about 18 or 19.
my doctor told me your sodium is really

355
00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:44.640
high yeah you need to cut salt out of
your diet

356
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.279
i just cut every food with like any
amount of sodium out of my diet

357
00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:52.880
like gone
and my sodium went to normal because i

358
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.440
was like
okay i'll get rid of it and you know so

359
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.919
that was
any prepackaged foods at all

360
00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:03.039
um
any like canned soups or anything like

361
00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:07.200
that like i cut just hot dogs you know
just everything gone

362
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.279
um
and i did it on a whim because my doctor

363
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:15.039
was like you should do this your sodium
is really high and i was like okay gone

364
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:21.279
so like i can cut any kind of food
out of my diet

365
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.600
like
i just need a reason to

366
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.840
and then see results from it yeah
because a month after i cut everything

367
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.919
out of my diet my doctor said oh your
sodium's back to normal

368
00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:37.679
so it was like within 30 days i had seen
a result

369
00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:41.760
so
that has always been my problem is i am

370
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.640
very
impatient

371
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.799
um i've never been able to just you know
eat right and you know lose a pound or

372
00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:52.080
two a week
like well yeah that's like a healthy way

373
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.279
of doing it and i'm like
nope nope that's not enough i need to

374
00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:59.120
see like marked weight loss and i think
that's been the problem with dieting

375
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.559
with you and i before is that when we're
doing that it's kind of like okay we'll

376
00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:06.559
do it the healthy way we'll eat the
proper amount of calories we like you

377
00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:09.840
i'll eat the proper amount of calories
um i'll do the right amount of

378
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.279
exercising i'll track everything that i
eat on this app on whatever app that i

379
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.400
have and it goes too slow and you get
discouraged and you're like what's the

380
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.200
point
uh well it goes too slow or doesn't go

381
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.880
at all yeah and
then i just because i am very impatient

382
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.400
i then
just get frustrated and stop

383
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.279
yeah um and that's why i was like okay
the the gastric sleeve is the way to go

384
00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:37.200
because that doesn't give me the oppor
that doesn't give me the option to just

385
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.919
stop there's no there's
most of the stomach isn't there anymore

386
00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:47.440
yeah like i can't reverse that
um and i was fine with that

387
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.279
like having that sort of free will taken
away yeah uh i was fine with the

388
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:56.720
side effects i was less fine with
especially like heartburn and stuff like

389
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.120
that because i just i can't handle
heartburn

390
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.240
no i can't well yeah it was like it was
it wasn't until you sort of mentioned

391
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.679
the heartburn that you kind of started
to get the shadow over your face it was

392
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:12.159
like oh that he this really matters to
him and like i have chronic because for

393
00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:16.000
me that's that's a quality of life thing
like if i wake up every day with

394
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.360
heartburn life is not worth living
like um i have chronic heartburn

395
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.480
problems i have bad acid reflux i think
it's linked to stress i find when i was

396
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.039
back in school when i had consistent
jobs my heartburn was chronic i needed

397
00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:35.919
to be taken taking xantec like every day
sometimes twice a day yeah in order to

398
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:39.360
function and they're 24-hour pills
yeah

399
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.039
um i ate toms like candy yeah um still
kind of do sometimes probably more out

400
00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:48.159
of habit though well yeah you have tums
in like every room in the apartment you

401
00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:52.000
have toms in the car there are two of
them in the car there is a backlog in my

402
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.120
um cabinet um
you buy them in bulk literally at costco

403
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.600
yeah uh so yeah like i i'm no stranger
to that but like

404
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.520
you know different bows were different
floats so like

405
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.360
yes i can't handle heartburn like pain

406
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.039
i have gotten used to like back pain
foot pain like you should see me at the

407
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:18.720
end of every video
like after i'm done filming it oh yeah

408
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.840
nick can attest to this after standing
there in front of the camera for two

409
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.600
hours filming there's just this wheeze
like like when i'm like okay i'm done my

410
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.720
body just kind of collapses because my
feet and knees are in so much pain

411
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.000
and that is because my feet and knees
are holding up

412
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.919
a lot of weight
like i weigh 250 pounds

413
00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:43.039
um
a lot of people don't

414
00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:45.520
like they see me in the videos and
they're

415
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.440
i don't think they think i weigh that
much yeah um

416
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.799
it's because all of it is in my
midsection

417
00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:58.720
like even like
my upper arms my thighs they're like

418
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.799
not that big
my midsection is where it is all at yeah

419
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:06.240
that is where it's really bad for heart
disease and stuff yeah

420
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.799
um
and you know like that's a and i i don't

421
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:14.240
want to feel like it's sort of like oh
no it's just for body and stuff like

422
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.799
that matters like well it does because
my my family is the history of heart

423
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:23.760
disease my grandfather had a quadruple
bypass um

424
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.520
that's a very complicated heart surgery
if you don't know what it is basically

425
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.799
it's really complicated and oh some
people don't a lot of people don't make

426
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.760
it out of their lives yeah it means that
they basically the surgeons have to

427
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.440
basically go insert their instruments
through the heart they don't open the

428
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.720
heart they have to go through the valves
in the heart and the bypasses mean that

429
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:47.039
they have to bypass four valves yeah he
also has had did have open heart surgery

430
00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:52.159
um so did my grandmother uh and my
grandmother was severely diabetic she

431
00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:56.960
lost her sight and everything
my father has diabetes my mother oddly

432
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.520
had no heart problems no
diabetes problems or anything like that

433
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.399
but then cancer yeah um
and

434
00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:10.559
every adult in my family has had a heart
attack at some literally all my aunts

435
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:15.039
and uncles have had a heart attack wow
my father hasn't father has okay and

436
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:21.279
he's like the oldest one
and so it's so confusing uh health

437
00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:24.880
human bodies they're they're so
confusing but

438
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.760
um
so like my my family is the history of

439
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:37.039
heart disease and and diabetes and so
like that that is my main reason for

440
00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:42.000
wanting to lose weight is so that you
know i don't die when i'm 40. because i

441
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.960
have a cousin who was mowing his lawn
one summer great shape

442
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:54.799
34 years old heart attack and died
34 years old jeez like not overweight

443
00:29:54.799 --> 00:30:00.159
healthy didn't smoke so many cousins oh
you say like i have this cousin like

444
00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:03.279
okay i know where this is going and no i
don't

445
00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:09.200
but like he died at 34 of a heart attack
and like i'm 33. yeah and so i'm like i

446
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.600
don't want to give the world any more
reason than i than it needs to try and

447
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.120
kill you yeah yeah and but at the same
time like i just want to say like you

448
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.159
know like being not comfortable in your
own body takes a severe toll on you know

449
00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:25.279
your ability to function on like
executive levels

450
00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.080
um
you know just in terms of interacting

451
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.880
with people presenting yourself with
confidence um work finding work getting

452
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.360
work
um

453
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.000
like there's a lot of times that you say
that you were in interviews and you kind

454
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.159
of felt like you know your body size was
something that was preventing employers

455
00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:45.279
from kind of engaging with you
especially especially from the way like

456
00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:48.799
work culture kind of demands you know
nice clothes and we're back to the

457
00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:52.399
clothing argument about like can we you
find clothes that fit you it's like you

458
00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:56.320
have to pay like five times more bare
minimum to get the kind of clothes that

459
00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.880
you need and it doesn't matter how much
you spend on those clothes the love

460
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.440
handles are still hanging over the pants
yeah and so

461
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.000
like it doesn't matter how much you
spend on them yeah like that's

462
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.039
trump
your clothes cannot fix that

463
00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:16.159
and
you know so that's that's a big

464
00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:21.679
confidence just
destroying things oh yeah um and like we

465
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.840
can talk about how we're in a culture
that like you know like oh we don't

466
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.159
discriminate against weight we do and
like i can look in the mirror from you

467
00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:31.120
know
chest up and be like

468
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.880
okay i can work with this
like i constantly talk about like the

469
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.880
fat on my neck and that's that's why i
wear turtlenecks in like every video

470
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.760
um but i'm like okay i can work with
this but as soon as the picture widens

471
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.960
and it goes down to my midsection i'm
like no i can't work with this yeah um

472
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.640
and like there's too much there for like
liposuction or anything like that

473
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.440
and so i'm like okay i will do this diet
because like

474
00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.919
there's i i have never felt comfortable
in my body ever like it's it's

475
00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:06.880
borderline body dysphoria
like i do not belong in this body

476
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.360
like that's the way my brain
kind of works like my brain is

477
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.399
you're you're annoyed at me talking over
no i'm not i'm not already talking i

478
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:17.360
just um i just had something lined up
and i'm trying to remember it commit it

479
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.120
to memory
okay we'll say it um i can't remember

480
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:27.440
i got distracted
uh no i was gonna say like um like you

481
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.880
know the kind of personality you are
especially like when you do have an

482
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.120
energy up like you don't really seem to
kind of fit the personality that is

483
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.720
limited by the kind of body you have
like you do kind of you do like to be

484
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.240
active you do like to go out and do
things uh sometimes you just don't have

485
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.279
the energy to because that's another
thing about having a lot of weight on

486
00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:48.880
you is that it kind of really saps the
energy out

487
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.559
it's never that i don't have the energy
to go do something

488
00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:57.039
it's always
what will people

489
00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:59.120
see
yeah

490
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.880
it's not an energy thing okay
um

491
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.720
when i'm bored i get tired
but i think that's more out of boredom

492
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.039
my energy is fine like
if someone were to call me at any time

493
00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:16.720
of the day and say like oh hey let's go
to x

494
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.000
or something um

495
00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:23.760
the first thing that goes through my
mind isn't uh do i have the energy to do

496
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.399
that it's
what how will people look at me

497
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:35.440
and that's my biggest problem is i have
like i said huge body dysphoria this is

498
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.399
not the body i am supposed to be in and
it never has been and i have never not

499
00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:44.720
been in this body
um i wasn't skinny and became fat i was

500
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.559
always fat
like even like pictures of me as like a

501
00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:52.399
four-year-old i was fat
um

502
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:57.279
and
i'm sick of it yeah and like a lot of a

503
00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:01.440
lot like i think it
is compounded

504
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.720
by
the way that

505
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.359
the gay community specifically the gay
male community reacts to

506
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:14.480
overweight people
like the whole no fats no femmes thing

507
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.359
yeah like

508
00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:23.760
just that that is such an integral part
of the gay male community

509
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.079
where it's like well the community like
as a sort of culture is built on you

510
00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:33.839
know having and desiring sex appeal
um in a very superficial way and like

511
00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:38.159
i've seen old queens talk about like you
know the gay community before grinder

512
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:43.839
uh as kind of like a carbon date like
you know like be bg before grinder um

513
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:49.119
and how like the queer community was
like more accepting um maybe accepting

514
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:52.480
is a bad word but you know like more
open to the idea of sleeping with

515
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.000
personalities rather than body types
it's not about sleeping with that's the

516
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.680
thing like everyone assumes it's about
sex it's not

517
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.560
like trying to me being a gay person and
trying to meet gay people

518
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.800
in today's day and age the only way to
meet them is

519
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.160
by luck
or on dating apps

520
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.240
and and even if you just want to be
friends with someone if you read their

521
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.839
profile and you're like oh we're into
the same stuff

522
00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:23.440
and you say hi
nine times out of ten if you are

523
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.359
overweight
you are immediately blocked or ignored

524
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.800
well that's what i'm trying to say like
even though like um you know there is

525
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.480
more to the queer community than gay
male community than sex

526
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.599
um that's kind of the presumption when
it comes to these hookup apps and these

527
00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:42.320
social apps they're like the idea of
i i feel like there's this kind of

528
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.079
stigma about being seen with an
undesirable gay to an extent um

529
00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:53.839
like or even b is being associated
um there is a huge fat phobia i've seen

530
00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:56.320
um
like just kind of from the very

531
00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.240
superficial way that a lot of these
people kind of approach their relations

532
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.359
um and that's part of the reason why i
once again decided to stop engaging with

533
00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:11.200
these kind of spaces because it is
shockingly shallow as every time and

534
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.920
every time i log on it's much more
shallow than i remember it being and

535
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.720
then i realized maybe i'm just less
shallow than i used to be

536
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.200
um

537
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.440
so like yeah i'm trying to kind of
cooperate you know

538
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.920
these feelings
i'm i'm

539
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.960
okay
you you look like you think i'm judging

540
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.160
you or something
um

541
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.280
but like to get back to your point it
does

542
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.839
like from older people older gays that
i've talked to

543
00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:45.119
it does seem like before grind when it
was bars

544
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:49.440
you were less likely you couldn't just
you know click block when you saw one of

545
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.839
the yeah when a bigger person because
there were social standards and when

546
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:54.560
it's in public people watch you
interaction with other people well not

547
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.920
just that but
you would like if someone wanted to buy

548
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.160
you a drink or something like that you
might at least say hi to them

549
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.200
and then you might talk to them and even
though it wouldn't become a sexual

550
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.839
relationship or a romantic one it might
become friends because you might have

551
00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:12.800
things in common
but

552
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.760
that
dynamic there there's a section of that

553
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.359
sort of
progress bar that was removed with

554
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:25.520
online dating yeah where you could just
look at someone's profile picture

555
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.079
and
then

556
00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:31.920
get the axe yeah and like on certain
dating apps and stuff like people have

557
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:37.440
messaged me when i have just my my face
up there and lots of people message me

558
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.240
and then they ask for a body picture and
i send them one like fully clothed

559
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.760
because i will never be seen shirtless
um

560
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.200
not until after the the
the

561
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.160
oh even then there'll be leftover skin
and everything i'm fine with that but um

562
00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.599
i send them you know a picture of me
from the waist up

563
00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:01.760
boom blocked gone and that's what i mean
like and that's after like a half hour

564
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.320
to an hour of having a decent
conversation with them about stuff

565
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.040
and that's kind of what i was saying
like you know like these social apps

566
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.160
kind of
create an environment where you can

567
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.760
sculpt your friend your dream friend
group you know like it's almost

568
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.599
like a dating sim like you get to pick
and choose what your fr your friend

569
00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.640
group looks like and you get to craft
that you know sex and the city style

570
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.040
television show that you always that all
gay men want to live in yeah um you know

571
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.560
like none of the four girls had weight
problems so

572
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.640
um you know you get to live that reality
and i find a lot of gay people do kind

573
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.920
of approach that
um very caricature-esque you know take

574
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.119
on developing these kind of friendship
especially developed by you know social

575
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:47.440
media not just you know dating apps but
also kind of wanting to have that our

576
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.800
typical ideal
gay friend group going to brunch and

577
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.760
doing fun gay events at pride or
whatever yeah so on and so so forth

578
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.720
um
you know when you look at media none of

579
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.960
that really involves you know validating
fat people as part of these friend

580
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.440
groups yeah so like
it's it's not part of the fantasy

581
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.839
um and whereas you can't really do that
in real life you can't just kind of hold

582
00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:16.560
up a hand to someone in a bar and say
like no sorry no thanks i mean some do

583
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.560
some do but you know
they have very specific friend groups

584
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.920
and people don't like talking to rude
people so you know they're limited you

585
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.000
can't do that as readily in open social
spaces yeah the way that you can in on

586
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.400
dating apps where you know it's like
you talk to someone it's like you you

587
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.040
used to talk to me about people and
you're like oh that guy blocked me and

588
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.079
i'm like oh well i don't want to talk to
him anymore yeah so it's that kind of

589
00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:44.000
attitude where that's done much more
anonymously because it's not as it's not

590
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.640
a visible network and this is something
that um in an upcoming video

591
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.320
um that's going to be talking about fire
island that we're going to be kind of

592
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.599
discussing is you know the the fall of
gay spaces for online ones and how that

593
00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:01.200
has kind of really
kind of hit the community pretty hard it

594
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.640
changed the community and like sort of
changed our social outlook completely

595
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.400
changed the community um

596
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.560
but
like so being a gay man that

597
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.040
environment and that reality does have a
huge effect on me

598
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.560
um it does make me

599
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.119
feel
worthless no matter what i'm doing

600
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.079
elsewhere
yeah for a giant section of the

601
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:31.520
population
i have no worth yeah because i'm not

602
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.680
even worth being friends with because
you know i don't fit literally don't fit

603
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.720
in the mold
um

604
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.920
and you know i can have
as of today 200 000 youtube subscribers

605
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.160
i can have videos with hundreds of
thousands and millions of views i can

606
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.240
have you know
people believing in me enough to you

607
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:58.240
know fund a production company yeah like
all of that but there is always this

608
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.599
thing hanging over me
that is like

609
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.920
and i never really talk about this but
it's like

610
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.680
you know i've made a career out of
talking about gay stuff

611
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.599
and making videos about gay culture and
the gay community and it's like well

612
00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:18.720
you're really not a part of it because
you're fat

613
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.640
you aren't allowed in that community
you're kind of it's it's less about

614
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.359
talking about the community i'm in and
more about like jane goodall observing

615
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.839
the apes

616
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.280
like that's what it's like you're
anthropologists yeah okay i like that

617
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.319
um and that doesn't say that there
aren't bigger gate

618
00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:42.400
bigger gay guys in the community but no
absolutely like there's a bear community

619
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.520
as i think
even like you know interact like bigger

620
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.079
gay guys interacting with you know like
non-fringe communities so like the

621
00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:55.040
prime queer prime queer queer core the
cor the queer core

622
00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:02.319
queer core queer court uh c-o-r-p um
you just watched attack on titans

623
00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:07.200
which i have become obsessed he has
become obsessed with i am building

624
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.960
a wall of city almost did not get the
nintendo video out on time because he

625
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.880
was too busy bringing attack on time
yeah

626
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.160
so like you know like the video's out
i'm watching it again but these are

627
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.000
people
who

628
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.920
have come into the queer spaces they
know how to navigate them and they have

629
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.480
found ways to feel rewarded and feel
valuable yeah whereas like both of us

630
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.680
are queer outsiders we come from small
communities

631
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.599
we spent a lot of time in small
communities like i never met another gay

632
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:38.480
person in person
until

633
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.520
university yeah
um and like honestly i'm kind of in the

634
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.520
same boat like for the majority of my
life i've only met other gay people

635
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.640
through gay social media that's a lie i
did have a boyfriend in high school but

636
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.960
yeah but like um
not a good one

637
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.839
that's a long story
uh isn't he a priest now

638
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:05.359
no no that was after high school
okay he's a

639
00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:09.440
he works with politicians or something
or he's a historian that explains a lot

640
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.480
yeah um
so like

641
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.240
we are both kind of outsiders and we're
both trying to change that the

642
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.839
difference is you don't you haven't
really gotten ways to

643
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:23.440
you know kind of have that confidence in
spite of negative feedback from gay

644
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.280
people like you know we don't have those
ways of navigating we don't have those

645
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.000
ways of kind of circumventing uh stigmas
and it's kind of weird because we we

646
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.160
both have we're both trying to kind of
move past the insecurity but we both

647
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.599
have the opposite in security
whereas

648
00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:47.920
you could enter a gay space and you know
you've got the you're cute you've got

649
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.800
this baby face you would immediately be
welcomed in

650
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.760
but you
feel emotionally i'm a weirdo yeah like

651
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.359
emotionally you feel like oh god what
can i if i say the wrong thing they're

652
00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:02.800
going to hate me honestly like we can do
it we can do a next podcast thing where

653
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.200
we talk about my experiences because i
have been in queer spaces and i have

654
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.040
been horrendously stigmatized because i
didn't know that i'm in minutia of

655
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.160
social navigation yeah um and so like i
just i didn't understand what shade was

656
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.079
yeah i still love i can't pick it up i
don't do sarcasm i don't do hints you

657
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:23.680
should have a shade button
[Laughter]

658
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.079
um
so like

659
00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:31.119
these these queens kind of ran danced in
circles around me like insulting me

660
00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:34.319
without insulting me
um

661
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:38.720
and that was that was god that was back
in ottawa pride before i met you um so

662
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.680
like i had very negative
feeling a very negative um remembrance

663
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.599
of that and honestly my more recent
reprisal with pride communities wasn't

664
00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:51.760
that much different either let's be
honest yeah but what i was getting to is

665
00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.280
like you physically
fit in

666
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.079
but you
[Music]

667
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:02.160
um
struggle emotionally

668
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.880
don't you you struggle there
whereas

669
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.160
i am immediately blocked because of my
size

670
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.319
but
when i do get into groups

671
00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:18.480
i have a natural networking mind i do
and i don't give a [ __ ] what people

672
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.839
think about me yeah because other than
the fat thing like oh you don't like my

673
00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:24.880
personality go [ __ ] yourself cause like
you know you

674
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.480
actually do make a whole lot of success
like just kind of approaching porn stars

675
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.880
or at least you have in the past like
porn stars directors uh you used to talk

676
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.800
to chichi leroux
um like that's what i mean like you can

677
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.520
just kind of drop a hat start talking
about people yeah yeah that's true

678
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.960
um but it's like
despite that but there's a gatekeeper

679
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.200
yeah so you can't flash your balls
there's there's a gatekeeper that's

680
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.319
literally like
we've made the gate too small for you

681
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.800
so bad like um turn around go home you
fat troll

682
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.480
um
[Music]

683
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.839
and yes it literally is that rude
sometimes yes

684
00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:12.000
like skinny people don't buy it you have
shown me the receipts and documentation

685
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.160
of these people saying these things to
you some of the things that i have been

686
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.839
called on like things like grinder and
even scruff which was supposed to be

687
00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:24.800
like the grinder for bigger people yeah
um

688
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.720
just
horrendous that a queer person would say

689
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.440
that about another question i i know you
skinny to moderate size person are

690
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.079
thinking like oh it can't be that bad i
was in that boat many years ago

691
00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:43.599
until like i said i saw that i saw the
um the messages um and these are people

692
00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:47.200
and a lot of some of these people were
people who i actually talked were very

693
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.000
polite and kind and patient with me
uh and then you showed me i was like i'm

694
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.160
not [ __ ] talking to them anymore
i i have a bit of a mama bear syndrome

695
00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:01.680
when it comes to my friends um there's
still an unnamed author that i

696
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.000
i can't yeah yeah i i'm not we're not
going to talk about him

697
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.920
um that you got in a scuffle with
and he said some he did and said some

698
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.359
things that i really did not cotton to
and i i don't i don't forgive or forget

699
00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:21.760
like guys he still has me blocked on
twitter yeah

700
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.440
um so that i i unfollowed i
can't remember if i had the book

701
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.160
pre-ordered out of you know solidarity
or not but no i did you did okay

702
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.800
um i'm the pre-order of books here you
are the pre-order of books i've bought a

703
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.480
few books over the years i mostly just
mooched from yours

704
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.359
um
[Music]

705
00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:50.319
but yeah so like it's
you really would not believe the kind of

706
00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:56.319
vitriol that gets launched at people
for being fat and it's like i've said

707
00:47:56.319 --> 00:48:00.240
like it's kind of almost like a how dare
you kind of thing like how dare like wha

708
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.800
like they say it's like it's they take
it personally like okay you think that

709
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.800
that's my league like yeah
and like it's

710
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.000
i've said it on streams before
but

711
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.040
i can count the amount of times that
i've been called a [ __ ]

712
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:24.800
like on one hand
like especially to my face yeah um

713
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.200
it just wasn't a thing
and has never been a thing i've never

714
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.599
been made fun of for being gay i've
other than that one time i've never been

715
00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:36.880
like attacked or anything like that for
being gay bullied

716
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.720
um i got it bad
i ironically before anyone had a

717
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.880
conceptual melody of sex i was being
hoardedly bullied for being gay so

718
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.960
anyway continue but
i

719
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.640
was bullied for being fat
the minute i got to school

720
00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:02.559
like preschool okay can i actually um
i'm sorry if this is triggering james um

721
00:49:02.559 --> 00:49:05.440
i don't get triggered

722
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.920
uh i was friends with a girl back in
elementary school this is i i was

723
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.520
bullied for being gay like my elementary
school before this is i was bullied for

724
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.359
being gay at the age where people are
still afraid of cooties yeah so i don't

725
00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:21.599
know what was up but it was bad enough
to put me into a my first really dark

726
00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:24.640
space and i think a lot of my depression
issues kind of stem

727
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.720
from that very early developmental term
whatever whatever anyway so it was a

728
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.880
popular school ground thing to just call
nick gay um any number of horrible

729
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.920
things
and this girl did

730
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.040
and that must have caught me on a bad
day because i'm like i'm not going to

731
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.720
take this i called her fat yeah because
she was

732
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.480
maybe still is um
i don't know i don't know everything

733
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.240
about her i don't know her she's a cool
girl we got along it's just that this

734
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.640
one time i was i was out for blood
uh and we kind of escalated over the

735
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.480
course of our recess for about 10
minutes until a teacher came over i got

736
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.520
scolded
i got scolded for calling her fat not

737
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.599
for but you know i i kind of pointed out
she was calling me gay

738
00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:08.640
this was she did it first this is
retaliation

739
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.559
and i think it was madame pepper
um

740
00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:16.240
she was a french teacher
yeah in

741
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.319
bilingual schools you know french
teachers were madame and

742
00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:24.400
um english teachers were misses yeah

743
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:30.960
um and i got school did i got in trouble
um i don't necessarily know how this

744
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.319
factor is in there but like

745
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:40.240
it it seems like it's
more common and expected to receive like

746
00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.000
people have like teachers well for a
very long time i mean it's it's

747
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.480
it's
been

748
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.760
uncool to make someone to make fun of
someone for being fat yeah but it's been

749
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.240
more accepted to make fun of someone for
being gay or being feminine or being

750
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.440
queer in some way
um

751
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.119
and
like i think

752
00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:07.040
and you know in the comments by all
means point out if i'm wrong here i

753
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.400
think i kind of was at the tail end of
that

754
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.440
um
i was at the tail end of where

755
00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.079
making
fun of

756
00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:19.520
where it was you weren't going to be
punished for calling someone fat now i

757
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.400
think you know people get made fun of
kids make it get made fun of for being

758
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.559
fat of course but i think there's a
punishment involved now well like i say

759
00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:30.640
because i am younger than you so like
yeah this was happening um i don't know

760
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.960
but like you know
it seemed like there was a social

761
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.400
understanding of fatness and that
teachers were prepared to kind of

762
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.440
countermend that yeah um just in terms
of how socially prevalent it was whereas

763
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.559
you know like what's one or two kids
being called a f-word on a school ground

764
00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:54.160
the other f word uh [ __ ] yeah
um

765
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:58.160
uh like you know like they don't know
how to deal with that yeah um and

766
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.200
similarly when i got bullied and other
instances were being gay sometimes very

767
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.480
severely it was one of those instances
okay we're going to bring everyone into

768
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.760
the room and talk about why it's bad but
we're not going to single anyone out

769
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.280
yeah whereas like other sort of offenses
had more specific punishments yeah

770
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.720
directed at specific people
um

771
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.880
but
that's a bit of a derail because we were

772
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.720
talking about like that just the
unbelievable kind of negativity that

773
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.720
gets hurled your way not just negativity
but the vile things that get sent not

774
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.880
just my way like by all means this isn't
an exclusively me thing oh sorry i

775
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.240
forget that i'm talking to a crowd i was
talking to you specifically but like

776
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.680
fat people overweight people
in general

777
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.800
like and there are many terms
you know fat people big people

778
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:49.280
overweight people um
a lot of people

779
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.400
who fall into the category prefer one or
the other i'm

780
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.160
you know open season you know use
whatever word you use

781
00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.720
you want it to not be true so you
don't really care it's like you say it's

782
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.280
like you know you don't feel like it's
your body so it's not your body being

783
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.400
insulted it's someone else's body that
you're living in

784
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.280
kind of it's like
but at the same time

785
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.480
i take it very if someone makes fun of
me for it

786
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.760
i take it very personally yeah um
and whereas if someone made fun of me

787
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.079
for being gay from the very beginning i
was like yeah

788
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:28.400
and yeah because there's no change in
that didn't want to change it i like

789
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.359
dick
sorry i'm not sorry

790
00:53:31.359 --> 00:53:34.960
but you call me fat that's something
i've been actively trying to change my

791
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.440
entire life and so that's calling out
something that i'm failing at changing

792
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:45.040
um
and just forever like since grade

793
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.280
since preschool i was made fun of for
being fat like me and my friends

794
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.640
um
had a core group of friends in preschool

795
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:59.359
so this was when i was four or five
um and we would play power rangers

796
00:53:59.359 --> 00:54:03.359
and you know i was billy and my friend
brandon was jason and

797
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:06.880
et cetera et cetera
and

798
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.599
there were people who told me you can't
be a power ranger you're fat

799
00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:15.680
when i was like four or five yeah like
other people in the classroom other kids

800
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.280
in the classroom yeah not teachers
teachers um didn't a teacher with a

801
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:26.720
player something kind of
that's yes okay yeah i love the story um

802
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.760
in grade primary which is
canadian kindergarten okay um

803
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.960
or at least kindergarten where i was
yeah um i went to kindergarten in

804
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.760
ontario grade zero let's say yeah um
we always had a christmas pageant

805
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.920
and a christmas concert
and so at the christmas concert for the

806
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:52.799
great primary kids were doing
him baby jesus in a manger blah blah and

807
00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:56.240
because you know there could only be one
mary and one joseph and three wise men

808
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.280
etc
most of us ended up being farm animals

809
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.760
as happens with uh nativity plays yeah
um

810
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:09.200
so i was already very insecure about my
weight

811
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:14.720
um
and so the teacher made me the cow

812
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.400
and that did not go over well with me
um

813
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:24.079
to the point where i like was screaming
you launched an inquisition

814
00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:30.160
like i i like
i spent a good week trying to tell him

815
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.000
don't make me the cow don't make me the
cow and then he shows up and gives me

816
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.920
the cow costume
and i was like

817
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.920
no and i just dropped it on the floor
walked out down to the principal's

818
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.480
office and his name was mr mcneil long
story about that um

819
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.839
and i went to the principal and i said
mr mcneil's calling me fat

820
00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:53.599
and she was just like what the [ __ ] and
so like she brought him into the

821
00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:57.280
principal's office and everything and
he's like i am not calling him fat

822
00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.880
i'm just catching him as the cow
and she was like

823
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.960
jimmy because they called me jimmy
why

824
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.640
why are you so offended by that i was
like because everyone calls me fat and

825
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.799
he's saying i'm a cow
and i'm like the odd like white people

826
00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:16.799
optics like
cow has been a derogatory and this is

827
00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:19.920
what i don't know why is why does it
have to do with white people

828
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.680
white optics is a white people's
favorite word

829
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.799
but like you know like this is what i
mean like um

830
00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:32.240
like cow has been used as a derogatory
term for fat people yeah for a very long

831
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:36.559
time and i don't understand why
elementary school teachers play dumb

832
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:41.119
like kids just don't know these things
because it's like you're you're casting

833
00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:46.400
a fat person as a cow
what do you think is going on here like

834
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.960
cast you as a sheep like yeah or like
why is it in great primary i was

835
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.119
probably not that big like looking back
at pictures i was not that big i was

836
00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:58.640
chubby and especially but let me finish
sorry sorry um

837
00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.319
i was chubby so like he probably was
like

838
00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:05.200
you know
did not look at me as the fat kid

839
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.440
because there were kids that were bigger
than me

840
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.839
there have always been people bigger
than me in every situation

841
00:57:10.839 --> 00:57:14.720
um but
i was just not having it and i was

842
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.680
taking it very personally and he was not
copying to it and he was not giving in

843
00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.920
he was not saying okay you can be a
horse or you can be blah whatever and so

844
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.920
the principle
having a a brain was like i need to

845
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.119
defuse this before his mother gets
involved because she knows my mother

846
00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:34.400
knowing your mother
my mother would later get involved a

847
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.319
couple years down the line with a
different mcneil um

848
00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:43.599
the mcneil clan but so she went out to i
don't know a costume store wherever she

849
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:47.200
came back with some goat horns and said
you're a goat now

850
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:52.319
and i was like cool same costume that's
literally all they had to do and see

851
00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:56.799
this is what i mean um
without talking about specifics i have a

852
00:57:56.799 --> 00:57:59.520
family member who works in a school
board

853
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.119
um i know for a fact that this is the
kind of stuff that teachers will

854
00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:07.440
collaborate in the lounge with and joke
about like he said he doesn't want to

855
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.799
get cast as a cow i'm gonna cast him as
a cow just to show him

856
00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:16.160
that happens i'm not kidding that um you
you know you might think back to high

857
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.160
school you know where the teachers
lounge is

858
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.680
literally mean girls that scene from
mean girls where she goes around and

859
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.400
they talk about what the tables are that
is literally your your teachers there is

860
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.079
a teacher there is a table for the cool
teachers there is a teacher at a table

861
00:58:30.079 --> 00:58:33.280
for the artsy teachers the science
teachers like we have their own office

862
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.760
and they eat for lunch up there together
like i'm not kidding

863
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.000
your your teachers your school it's that
clicky on the management level like i

864
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.559
remember that clicky in high school
there in my high school there were

865
00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:50.240
different teachers lounges for the
departments so for like the science math

866
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:56.160
department um the english department etc
uh my history teacher she was the only

867
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.599
history teacher in the school she taught
all the history classes she ate at her

868
00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:03.440
desk
because she was not welcome with the

869
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.599
other teachers
she

870
00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:09.040
don't know she was the sweetest woman
the sweetest that's why i've ever that's

871
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.599
why
when i went to her in grade 11 and i

872
00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:14.079
said i want to make movies can you help
me

873
00:59:14.079 --> 00:59:16.960
uh
cast uh can you

874
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.000
can can you help me get an announcement
through the school she was the one who

875
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.920
signed off on the piece of paper yeah so
that over the school announcements over

876
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.520
the the pa it would be announced that
there's a student movie being made

877
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.280
teachers who give a damn about students
and she also fought to make sure that i

878
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.119
graduated and specifically teachers who
give a demo students are involved in

879
00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:41.040
drama programs usually are not welcome
with other teachers yeah um

880
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.799
and there's this attitude i don't quite
know what it is i would have to probe my

881
00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:52.000
family member um about um
about what i remember about why that is

882
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.400
i know when you're talking i don't want
to get her in trouble um because once

883
00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.440
again
the school board itself

884
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.599
is even clickier yeah like if they i'm
not gonna say i just i figured it out

885
01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:07.920
yeah um
so like it could be a matter of like

886
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.000
because you you get those i'll use my
high school example uh you have a

887
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.720
history teacher an english teacher
another history teacher and they are

888
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.599
basically like
the mean they're the plastics pretty

889
01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:23.119
much yeah um oh i want to call them out
so badly because they wear the plastics

890
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.720
they're the heathers
um

891
01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:31.040
sorry um
[Music]

892
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040
so like you know you have them and they
kind of dictate the who's who of the

893
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.720
school board of the school
and so like you get your other teachers

894
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.400
like my beloved miss mclaren
um

895
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.160
who was basically the dullest teacher in
the world i can see her not fitting in

896
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.839
with them and kind of just really
rubbing the wrong way because like

897
01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:54.240
they're really kind of this superficial
very kind of you know status obsessed

898
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.839
and she is this you know woman who's
been in the school for like ages and

899
01:00:57.839 --> 01:01:01.440
ages and ages teach math at you know
like a lower level he's really good at

900
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.040
teaching lower level math
um and you know she's just a sweetheart

901
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.400
she's involved in drama and she's she's
a keep it real teacher yeah um

902
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.760
they might not just get along and
because like the plastics kind of

903
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.319
control
uh the school in general like

904
01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:21.920
you know she kind of wouldn't have a
whole lot of places to be there

905
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.839
anyway um just got some flashbacks
but yeah so

906
01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:32.880
you can't sit with us
that was literally me and junior high

907
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.559
like i had
i had some friends in junior high they

908
01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:40.559
were all girls but they were all they
all became a part of a some kind of

909
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:43.760
group team thing
um

910
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.520
i i forget it was a girls it wasn't like
sports but it was something else but it

911
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.119
was only girls and so like at lunch they
would go do this team thing

912
01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:57.599
and so i had no one to hang out with and
so during junior high i would spend my

913
01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:01.039
lunch not eating
and

914
01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:06.799
standing in a corner reading a book
standing in a corner yeah um

915
01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:12.000
so i became known as the guy who reads
that is so lonely and sad i want to hug

916
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.160
you but that would mean wires and so i
became the known as the guy who reads

917
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.839
but then when people would approach me

918
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.160
i would win them over
almost immediately yeah because i was a

919
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.319
snarky [ __ ] yeah and someone in the
group would say something

920
01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:33.680
i would call them out for it i would be
a [ __ ] everyone else would laugh and be

921
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.680
like oh i like him oh so you were liz
lebanon with a good attitude kind of

922
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.000
yeah and so then the rest of them would
all end up being you know not friends

923
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.400
some of them would end up being my
friends for friendly yeah friendly to me

924
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.079
um
like i had some allies

925
01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:53.839
who were like really popular people
always throughout school but for the

926
01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:57.359
most part i didn't have all that many
friends um

927
01:02:57.359 --> 01:03:01.760
and it was always because i was the fat
kid

928
01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.480
i would get called fat by people much
bigger than me

929
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.280
and
i can only think it's because they were

930
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.960
trying to fit in with the skinnies
and so they were like yeah i'll join on

931
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.559
board and make fun of him because then
that takes the attention

932
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:20.720
social superiority it's like i am it's
not about you know i'm calling you

933
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.000
fat because you're fat or because you're
fatter than me i'm calling you fat

934
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.960
because
it's a way that i can demonstrate that

935
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.400
i'm above you yeah
and so all of this to say you know we're

936
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.079
over an hour into the podcast now all of
this to say

937
01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:39.680
that this lifetime of experience of
being overweight and fat

938
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.280
has worn you down
yeah to the point where i was like

939
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.280
i am going to
get a surgery

940
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.599
i am going to empty my bank account
and get this surgery

941
01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:55.119
because
i need it

942
01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:59.839
and only at not the last minute because
the surgery is like three weeks away but

943
01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:05.280
you know in surgical terms that's
probably at the last minute yeah um

944
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.720
kind of deciding
that

945
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.440
i'm too freaked out at the possibility
of the side effects yeah so we're going

946
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.720
to give it one more stab with the
traditional method

947
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.839
not traditional i'm not doing the
traditional because i can't do the

948
01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:24.000
traditional you know
you know eat a nice eat a good breakfast

949
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.160
and a good lunch
or lose one or two pounds a week no i

950
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.319
need to lose weight fast by traditional
i mean um what's what was the quote um

951
01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:39.520
eat nothing all day and then when you're
about to pass out eat a cube of cheese

952
01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:42.960
or a piece of cucumber was it was it
either i thought it was just a cube of

953
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.640
cheese i think it's cucumber because
that has more vitamins i just clearly

954
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.520
remember her saying cube of cheese so
who

955
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.559
oh i was talking about that devil wears
prada um oh

956
01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:57.200
um
maybe

957
01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.920
oh maybe it was cube of cheese but um
yeah so my plan and this is not healthy

958
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.920
so but you're also not gonna be doing it
for a very long time either yeah my plan

959
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.760
is basically a
next to liquid diet

960
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.760
very high protein liquid shakes that
i bought because of the surgery paid 300

961
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.680
for these but apparently this one woman
lost 50 pounds off of drinking these for

962
01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.559
three weeks so hey we're gonna try i'm
not trying to lose 50 pounds yeah if

963
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:30.480
like like i said i need to see a marked
change in a month

964
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.839
um
well not in a month but like because i'm

965
01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:40.400
giving myself until december now yeah to
see the marked change um

966
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.880
and
the thing with me is that i don't have

967
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.839
a kind of love relationship with food i
eat when i'm

968
01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:54.000
bored and because of the schedule that
i've built out for myself with videos

969
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.920
and movies
i don't really have a chance to be bored

970
01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.359
you do not have the time to be poor like
nick messaged me it's like are you up

971
01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:05.200
for recording a podcast tonight as i was
writing the next video

972
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.880
so
yeah i i don't have a chance to be bored

973
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.079
anymore well that's good because being
bored is something that i should

974
01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:16.880
probably spend another a week or two
doing well yes

975
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.359
uh
nick is going to be taking

976
01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:22.400
is six weeks off
um

977
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.640
minimum a month but longer if i can
yeah

978
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.559
you can off until i'm needed so yeah uh
all of june at the very least yeah so my

979
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:36.960
very baby's very first vacation never
taken a i've taken sick days i've never

980
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.960

i mean i was going to look at i was

985
01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:04.480
there's only two of us and i never take
my vacation so

986
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.319
i mean like there was that kind of time
like last year your vacation you did

987
01:07:08.319 --> 01:07:13.119
take like three weeks vacation at a time
no i tried every month

988
01:07:13.119 --> 01:07:17.280
oh yeah but at that same time i was also
working a full-time job that's true

989
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.960
that's true not
all of last year not all of last year

990
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.440
when i tried to take a break
last year that did not work out well you

991
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.559
went you got a little bit neurotic so
yeah i've been working too much since

992
01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:33.039
the beginning of the year um january
since january hit the ground running i

993
01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:35.760
think i've had
like i thought you were going to have a

994
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.400
heart attack when i came and said nick
we're going to do three videos a month

995
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.640
now

996
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.960
i almost cried um but i do the majority
of the writing on two of them so yeah

997
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.319
because um
i think for there was a few videos going

998
01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:51.760
on that was back in like the january or
the february march area and it was like

999
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.839
okay after this video you get to have
your two-week break and it was like the

1000
01:07:55.839 --> 01:08:01.280
video oh they demonetized it instantly
we need another video stat

1001
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.280
but now this is a constant marathon of
writing this is a good way of ending the

1002
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.200
podcast now
because of amazing people like you

1003
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.839
listening because of viewers like you we
don't have to have a panic attack when

1004
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:19.679
youtube demonetizes a video yeah now
it's kind of just funny

1005
01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:24.880
now i'm just like
now like when i uploaded the the the the

1006
01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.719
last video video game
the nintendo video

1007
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:32.000
um i was like i don't think there's
anything in here that could do monetize

1008
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.040
us but maybe
but

1009
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.080
i'm not gonna stress out about it
because i don't need to stress out about

1010
01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.480
it um it was the video it was one of the
shorter videos that was like hey this

1011
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.880
video doesn't do didn't do well lol um
oh the star wars one yeah yeah there's

1012
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.960
like a video about hope yeah
it's gotten i think it has less views

1013
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.279
than my preview video and it's like wow
people really hate star wars ain't that

1014
01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:59.359

good feeling oh god no that sounds

1030
01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:08.640
disgusting
there was once upon a time there was a

1031
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.000
this is the last story there was a
restaurant called jay's chicken where i

1032
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.480
grew up
and they had the most delicious

1033
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.440
like
salty gravy

1034
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.920
and when i oh don't tell me you drank it
on grade 6.

1035
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.840
listen listen listen
when i graded from the sixth grade

1036
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.679
um i decided that i was going to make
chicken soup with kfc's popcorn chicken

1037
01:10:35.679 --> 01:10:40.560
and jay's gravy
and it was delicious

1038
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.480

12 hot dogs 12 packages of 12 hot dogs
boiled at once at once with some with

some mustard and two boxes of mac and
cheese made in the microwave i mean the

1045
01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:18.560
must at once at once i mean the master
didn't have any calories no

1046
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.440

to lose weight when i was a teenager um

1047
01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.000
and i thought eating a bowl of popcorn
every day after school was a bad carb

habit
