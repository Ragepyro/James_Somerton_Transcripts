00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.880
cars is a Disney Pixar animated film
released in 2006 and was the seventh

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
film released by Pixar Animation Studios
this film followed a string of

3
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
emotionally evocative and intellectually
stimulating films just two movies after

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.260
the industry changing Finding Nemo the
success of the studio was predicated on

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.820
taking the typical gimmicks of Hollywood
animated movies and subverting their

6
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
juvenility with examinations of
emotional depth creative visual

7
00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.000
Direction and Stellar voice acting Pixar
defied all expectations that each

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.739
subsequent film would fall short of its
predecessor even a sequel to their debut

9
00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
movie Toy Story 2 was Far More Than Just
a shallow reprisal of all the same

10
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
themes of the first in a period of
Hollywood history when sequels were

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
Hollow Recreations of their prior
installments for the Studio's early

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120
history it seemed that they were the
real deal that even if they were

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
directing their films primarily to be
accessible to all ages they would treat

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.540
animation with dignity and integrity in
spite of being a subsidiary of Disney

15
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.159
Disney after all at the time was looking
for ways to collect Prestige without

16
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240
diluting the Disney brand as per their
offshoots of Touchstone pictures and

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.740
Miramax Pixar was granting them Prestige
and animation that typical cartoons

18
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.939
could not however as Disney's in-house
animation projects began to flounder

19
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.720
does anyone remember Home on the Range
they needed to perpetuate that good old

20
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
dizziness somehow lucky for Disney Pixar
was about to allow the mouse's brand

21
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
into their studio with cars which from
the initial ads audiences pegged as it

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.579
being a little more corporate when it
was released it was decried as soulless

23
00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.360
and not really having any other purpose
but to sell toys and in spite of the

24
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
success of Pixar's other films Toy Story
notwithstanding cars was the first to

25
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.820
get a sequel which is interesting
because it also has one of the least

26
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.659
impressive box office performances of
any pre-pandemic Pixar film and indeed

27
00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.500
whatever Soul the first movie had the
second one had less effectively

28
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.039
accomplishing nothing but giving Larry
the Cable Guy a feature-length stand-up

29
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.660
gig and confirming that 911 occurred in
the cars Universe which means that the

30
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.220
car's Cold War existed which means that
there was a car's nuclear arms race

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.879
which means that cars World War II
happened which demands the existence of

32
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.080
cars Hitler and subsequently the car's
assassination of Carr's Grand Duke Franz

33
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.180
Ferdinand which through the car's Holy
Roman Empire we can only extrapolate

34
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.379
that there was a Bubonic plague in the
cars universe as much as this may seem

35
00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.700
tongue-in-cheek it's highlighting a very
key problem that developed in Pixar

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.900
whereas before they would take a concept
like monsters in the closet or ant hill

37
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.180
politics and build a world around that
the studio used absurdity and scale to

38
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.440
either integrate the plausibility of
their plots into our world or like The

39
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.760
Incredibles would dismiss plausibility
and cultural identification altogether

40
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.800
for this reason cars seemed half-baked
was it in this world or not where was it

41
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.040
drawing from our history and where was
it just kind of doing its own thing but

42
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.340
of course that mattered less than
selling cars merchandise which when you

43
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.060
look at how much money cars merchandise
has made next to every other stream of

44
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.620
Revenue at Pixar it's clear exactly why
cars got two sequels and a slew of

45
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.640
spin-offs and this would have been
dismissable as a project to appease the

46
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.959
Disney overlords who needed to push
merch off of those Disney store shelves

47
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.760
like any parent lacking responsibility
skills when Disney drops the ball one of

48
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.220
their kids has got to pick up the slack
it would have been dismissable if this

49
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.780
wouldn't be how Pixar would continue to
treat its projects between Cars 1 and 2

50
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.840
Pixar released a trio of prestigious
juggernauts Wally up and Toy Story 3

51
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.940
which earned Disney by proxy a long
coveted best picture nomination one for

52
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.500
Dad three for fans it seems like an
acceptable ratio Brave was the second

53
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.980
time that Pixar was really seen as
bending their Creative Vision to appease

54
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.700
Disney after Wally the last of the
original five Pixar Concepts to be

55
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.799
released Brave was closer in concept to
a Disney princess movie than Pixar's

56
00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.299
established brand and indeed Merida is
included in Princess merchandise Disney

57
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.620
got what it wanted a stop Gap after
Tangled and the Princess and the Frog

58
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.720
underperformed so they could sort out
what to do with frozen which was then an

59
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.160
adaptation of The Snow Queen and in cold
development hell Pixar began to

60
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.580
incorporate more human Focus stories
into their features the long-awaited

61
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.500
sequel to Finding Nemo was closer to
Cars 2 than Toy Story where the CIA

62
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.340
sequel was built entirely around a
takeaway character from the original and

63
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.300
the original protagonists were more or
less abandoned and it's not that Pixar

64
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.320
is making bad movies or that their
messaging is lacking but it seems that

65
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.120
they're leaning on gimmick storytelling
to do a whole lot more of the heavy

66
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.100
lifting like Bing Bong from inside out
who from the second he was on screen was

67
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.320
read as an emotional Pawn who was only
there to make the audience cry but then

68
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.240
there are movies like Coco onward Luca
and turning red which again were not bad

69
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.400
movies but it's not really clear why
these were Pixar movies because they

70
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.199
seem like Disney movies especially with
the mouse leaning into plot beats and

71
00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.940
styles like Big Hero 6 zootopia Ryan The
Last Dragon and Encanto it's hard to

72
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.699
really qualify why these latest Pixar
films seem so distant and to a large

73
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.680
extent it might be that Disney is just
trying to be more like Pixar but it does

74
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.900
feel like Pixar is taking notes from the
top developing stories where it is less

75
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.919
about a cast of personalities and more
about generating settings that younger

76
00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.479
viewers could imagine themselves in they
focus more on showing this world to the

77
00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.680
audience there's a spectacle made of the
creative process rather than passively

78
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.860
depicting characters interacting with
the world and trusting the audience to

79
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.880
pick up on the defamiliarization they
also focus more clearly around Coming of

80
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.900
Age whereas that wasn't really the
primary theme of a Pixar movie until

81
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.000
Brave which is absolutely Disney's
wheelhouse we're not likely ever going

82
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.240
to get another story about a lonely
robot where the first half of the movie

83
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
is entirely without dialogue and leads
an entirely New Generation to discover

84
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.919
why Hello Dolly put an end to the
original Hollywood musicals but the most

85
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.860
important distinction is the scope of
what these films are discussing

86
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.419
contemporary Pixar films discuss
self-actualization emotional growth

87
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.800
personal development and interactions
between the self and Society again

88
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.479
Disney's bread and butter nothing new as
far as animation goes however the reason

89
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:39.780
early Pixar films stood out so firmly is
that they handled more macro themes A

90
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.319
Bug's Life spoke to the power of
collectivism against a smaller class of

91
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.060
oppressors Monsters Inc was about the
moral bankruptcy of Corporations Wally

92
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.319
was about the invested interest of
keeping an entire population docile

93
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.979
independent The Incredibles and
Ratatouille in spite of being made by

94
00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.120
Brad Bird have different things to say
about classism which is unfortunate

95
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.720
because a lot of people grew up taking
notes about individual exceptionalism

96
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.000
from this raging Iran fan personal plot
beats are present in all of these films

97
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.319
but characters are secondary to what the
film has to say about Society at large

98
00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.060
even in earlier Pixar films that do
focus on characters topics and themes

99
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.099
remain more abstract Toy Story routinely
discusses abandonment issues and related

100
00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:30.360
trauma dictating who is or who is not
useful to social structures up focuses

101
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.639
on demystifying the idea of Youth being
the time to have Adventures and Finding

102
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.259
Nemo was more directed at parental
anxiety even cars was about learning how

103
00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.979
to slow down and appreciate the little
things in life that empathy and

104
00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:48.840
integrity can and should go a lot
further than chasing the next big deal

105
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.199
or the next big paycheck pay attention
we're going to come back to that later

106
00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:57.120
these days Pixar films seem to align a
lot more with what Disney is comfortable

107
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.099
with Coming of Age Family Values
friendship spectacles set pieces to show

108
00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:06.960
off just how much those computers can
render Etc honestly Encanto feels more

109
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.039
like a Pixar movie than anything that
Pixar's produce lately and no it's not

110
00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:15.960
subtle what's going on leaks from staff
at Pixar are all indicating that the

111
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.160
studio is under more and more creative
pressure to fit into the Disney mold

112
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.979
especially because in spite of tanking
staff morale Pixar has now in large part

113
00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:30.720
been moved to the exclusively for
streaming part of Disney plus and

114
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.060
believe me this does have a lot to do
with the process of creating Independent

115
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:42.000
Media Pixar as a studio should be seen
as maybe not a cautionary tale because

116
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.839
it still is where animator's dreams come
true and in spite of their creative

117
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.100
shift they are producing Stellar content
we're not talking at all about the

118
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.519
quality of what's being made we're
talking about the creative process

119
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:57.660
behind how it's created guys it's okay
to like Pixar movies please do not go to

120
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.860
the the comments and say that I'm
trashing Pixar I am not but this should

121
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.820
be seen as just what happens the more a
creative Venture gets Tangled into a

122
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.260
large corporate structure Pixar
Animation Studio has its roots in Indie

123
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.399
filmmaking the technology was developed
in large part by George Lucas even

124
00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:22.500
though each one of the Star Wars Movies
featured the 20th Century Fox logo each

125
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.720
one with the exception of episode 4 was
financed and produced independently by

126
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.640
Lucas himself until Disney got them
following Star Wars Episode 6 he sunk

127
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.360
his hands ever deeper into the
technology that makes sound and visuals

128
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.000
he is one of the co-founders of THX
which everyone who lived in the 90s and

129
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.360
2000s will recognize as the logo that
told you to turn your volume down he

130
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.380
didn't really like working for Studios
but he did like working with other

131
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.100
filmmakers famously the Raptors in the
kitchen scene of Jurassic Park was

132
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.720
animated as a digital technology Flex by
industrial Light Magic George Lucas

133
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.279
special effects team meanwhile some
Cinema Empires can't be bothered to

134
00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:05.220
properly composite Mark ruffalo's head
into a scene for one of the most

135
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.300
expensive cinematic projects of all time
through this process Lucas toyed around

136
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.320
with using computer technology to make
animated shorts he abandoned the project

137
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.399
to ramp up his work on the Star Wars
prequels in the 90s where instead he

138
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.080
would be the guiding force on pioneering
Digital Cinema he was also a consultant

139
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.279
for digital effects for the Lord of the
Rings movies so no he's not just the

140
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.760
Star Wars guy he sold the Pixar
technology to Steve Jobs who in turn

141
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.720
sold it to Disney while maintaining a
strong creative control over the studio

142
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.399
the 2011 death of Steve Jobs also lines
up with Pixar's creative pivot Pixar

143
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:43.200
sets a unique stage for this reason as
it has been both in a tour driven

144
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.000
Animation Studio while also a cog in the
machine of a much larger art as product

145
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.260
product as art media Corporation but
specifically why are we talking about

146
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.399
this
when the image in the thumbnail is from

147
00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:01.380
a web series about cussy horny depraved
murderous demons in an environment where

148
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.220
sexual deviances of the norm none of
those words have ever been in a Pixar

149
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.339
movie and with the exception of murder
they're not in the Bible either having

150
00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:12.480
described how Pixar's content manifested
as per its relationship with corporate

151
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.579
oversight
what does that have to do with a hard R

152
00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:24.380
rated animated series on YouTube

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.920
technically a spin-off of an earlier
series she piloted called has been Hotel

157
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.180
it's closer to say it's a spiritual
successor while the shows exist in the

158
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.300
same universe they share few other
overlapping elements and are

159
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.200
thematically distinct a key difference
is the inclusion of Internet celebrity

160
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.339
Brandon Rogers as leading voice talent
and a major contributor to the series in

161
00:12:32.339 --> 00:12:35.880
conjunction with medrano's Signature
Care to setting and emotional

162
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.620
development hell of a boss stands out
even among Network animated series the

163
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.579
premise of hell of a boss follows Blitz
the O is silent as he runs a business

164
00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:49.079
which offers services to damned souls
for a nominal fee the immediate murder

165
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:53.820
professionals are just imp or imp will
zip on up to the world of the living to

166
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.320
get revenge on behalf of the now dead
person usually this involves killing

167
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.180
whoever the client blames for them being
in Hell imp is made up of Blitz Moxie

168
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.279
and Millie a happily married couple and
Blitz is adopt furry I mean

169
00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:13.200
hellhound daughter Luna as much as Moxie
in particular Longs for appropriate

170
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.820
work-life boundaries Blitz insists on
having a family environment at work

171
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.279
ironically the one person who actually
wants to be around Blitz is someone who

172
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:28.800
he is constantly trying to give the slip
Prince stolis one of the principal

173
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.019
rulers of hell is head over heels for
blitzy stolis himself is a little bit of

174
00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:38.760
a late bloomer to love and gay sex
having lived most of his life in a

175
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.940
Loveless marriage that he's only put up
with for the sake of his daughter

176
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.459
Octavia as a Croatia either a variation
of demon or a dynastic family stolis

177
00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:52.260
possesses a grimoire which can open
portals to the Mortal realm a book that

178
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.540
blitzy needs in order to get paid so in
order to borrow it from stolis he needs

179
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.639
to give the prince of Hell The Jerk
around to keep him hooked just enough

180
00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:06.959
while still being able to avoid
emotional intimacy but because the book

181
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:12.000
ultimately belongs to stolis Blitz does
kinda have to toe the line

182
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.860
stolis does on a few occasions
demonstrate why nobody should really get

183
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.000
on his bad side just your average pissed
off bottom stuff really the nature of

184
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.320
the plot forces Blitz into a situation
where he can either choose to abandon

185
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.360
what seems to be a last resort career or
to confront his attachment problems

186
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.620
we're getting into spoilers now go watch
the show it's on YouTube you have no

187
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.120
excuse as with all of medrano's content
on her channel vivzipop the series is

188
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.620
rot with gratuitous cussing gratuitous
violence and most of all gratuitous

189
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.120
genderblind sexuality which the first
two are nothing particularly new for

190
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.320
cartoons and even explicit sexuality
isn't anything too shocking for those of

191
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.800
us old enough to remember that drawn
together was once a thing but the degree

192
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.199
to which errant gender is depicted is
something that stands out from the norm

193
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:05.699
even in comedic animation where queer
people are included

194
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:11.579
we're usually just the butt of the joke
[Laughter]

195
00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:16.440
this is Hell after all it makes perfect
sense why all the Purity rules we hold

196
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.300
would be inverted there there isn't even
an everybody is bisexual or pansexual

197
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.440
angle either it's relatively clear that
where some characters have no preference

198
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.699
a character like stolis simply doesn't
have much interest in women whatsoever

199
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:34.019
the fact that he's leaving his wife for
a man is not scandalous the Scandal is

200
00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:38.279
that he's leaving her for a lesser demon
in hell where degeneracy is not only the

201
00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:44.100
norm but the social expectation the only
Real Taboo seems to be

202
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.579
affectionate monogamy it's a whole new
fetish called normally Moxie and Millie

203
00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:54.380
frequently have to face jeers and
criticisms about their

204
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.860
relationship though really they they
could they could stand to tone it down

205
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.660
just just a little bit the thing that is
shocking about hell of a boss however is

206
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.000
the very strange uncompromising quality
of the writing Under The Gallows humor

207
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.100
there is a strong underline a very
Salient emotional beats consistent

208
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.860
characters and recurring plot themes
which challenge these characters yes the

209
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.720
plots are outrageous and the setting is
outlandish but when the series wants to

210
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.940
be it can be shockingly real for
instance in the show about horny violent

211
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.260
demons I was caught off guard when an
entire episode ended up being dedicated

212
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:40.019
to exploring the way that children may
internalize their parents divorce why

213
00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:45.779
does he hate a bull that he loves me
it's fairly common to see media where

214
00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:50.339
children spiral through their parents
divorce at least in media where divorce

215
00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:55.980
is depicted at all which is still
shockingly infrequent as per actual

216
00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.180
divorce rates the depiction usually
focuses on how children go a little

217
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.919
sideways due to family cohesion breaking
up or some kind of abstract reasoning

218
00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:08.520
like that however this is also media
which depicts parents as being much

219
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.540
better at keeping their emotional [ __ ]
away from their kids I've spoken with a

220
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.459
few people who were either ambivalent or
relieved when their parents announced

221
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:21.600
that they were moving ahead with
separation children are shockingly good

222
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.919
at picking up that their parents just
aren't vibing with each other and

223
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:31.559
parents are shockingly bad at assuming
their kids aren't going to pick up on

224
00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:36.360
the needling each other over dinner hell
of a boss's Octavia has been living in

225
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.380
this home environment for some time and
although she does not seem that upset

226
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.000
about the divorce itself her concern is
that the divorce is going to drain the

227
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.720
life out of her parents so they won't
have anything left for her which is

228
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.919
quite the nuanced depiction especially
when it would have been easier to just

229
00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:57.059
depict the easy route especially now
that we're into the second season of the

230
00:17:57.059 --> 00:18:01.200
series the creators seem more
comfortable with depicting these kinds

231
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.440
of interactions gotta get the audience
hooked with the sex and violence first

232
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.620
though it's rare that an animated series
is allowed to go both ways there is

233
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.960
Saucy adult animation meant to push
boundaries like Rick and Morty or

234
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.559
well-developed animated dramas like
Slice of Life anime usually when

235
00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:24.000
networks approve any kind of series they
want things to be able to fit neatly

236
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.559
into categories this way it's easier to
qualify what kind of media is successful

237
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:33.840
because if you're operating off of a
numbers only situation it's impossible

238
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.340
to isolate what elements of a piece of
media make it successful the media in

239
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.340
question cannot be reduced to the sum of
its parts because quality in media is

240
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.260
more about how these parts interact it's
why Marvel sticks to the Marvel formula

241
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.580
they found something that agrees with
audiences but which has quantifiable

242
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:59.039
elements that can be controlled through
several layers of executive oversight as

243
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.880
long as their media sticks to this
pattern they can Bank on certain

244
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.220
projects being a success especially if
they aren't simply going to increase the

245
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.120
amount of low risk media they produce
and continue to put all of their eggs

246
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:18.299
into only a couple of very expensive
baskets for instance Avatar the way of

247
00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:25.080
water didn't break even until it hit 1.1
billion dollars at the box office even

248
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.960
though terrifier 2 only made 12.6
million that was 42 times its budget of

249
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.000
250 000. in order for Avatar to have
that same kind of profit margin it would

250
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.900
need to make 10.5 billion dollars which
means naturally Studio content is going

251
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.940
to get more formulaic because it needs
to fit proven models for success and

252
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.720
their media is going to begin to be
directed at the broadest possible

253
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.980
audience
but as a crowd-financed web series hell

254
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.480
of a boss is in a unique situation
Medrano does not strictly need to answer

255
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.100
to anyone to approve the content that
she wants to fill her media with

256
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.919
as a more or less independent Creator
she can make media

257
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:16.080
independently strictly speaking hell of
a boss is independent but the show from

258
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.419
which it spun off has been hotel is not
technically independent anymore has been

259
00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:26.400
was picked up by a studio for more
episodes none other than a24 the studio

260
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.919
I'd sell my left lung right kidney and
both nuts to work with a24 is a

261
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:36.720
relatively small Studio founded in 2012
though they themselves are a bit off the

262
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.220
beaten path the studio gained recent
Renown for releasing everything

263
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.559
everywhere all at once a critical inbox
office success however the Studio's

264
00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:51.419
other noteworthy venues include Swiss
army man ex machina hereditary the

265
00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:56.940
lighthouse and Euphoria the Studio's
history is interesting but essentially

266
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.100
amounts to a rich person throwing small
fortunes at creative types to just mess

267
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.700
around and find out it just so happens
that the creative people they throw

268
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.620
money at are exceptionally talented
maybe an a24 executive just watched the

269
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.559
pilot and decided they were going to
throw money at something that they

270
00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:18.299
wanted to see more of you know like
patreon Linked In the description God

271
00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:22.860
forbid a studio head that actually
watches and enjoys stuff industry's

272
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.280
secret is that the people running these
media companies

273
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.020
don't actually watch the movies or
television shows that they produce

274
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.640
patreon and other crowdfunding services
have made careers for small creators who

275
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.679
would have never otherwise managed to
find a platform artists existed because

276
00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:45.360
of patrons you know back in the day when
an old money type with titles and tracks

277
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.280
of land would see some poet or composer
and would pay them to live in their

278
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.919
Manner and make art the rich person then
gets to say hey I helped this cool

279
00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:59.880
artist friend who I am definitely not
having any gay sex with by the way make

280
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.480
something really really cool not a
perfect system especially because you

281
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.620
can't really criticize the wealthy
classes directly but clever artists and

282
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.700
this is one thing that Shakespeare was
very good at would sneak in some real

283
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.860
social commentary he was also apparently
pretty good at the gay sex part too

284
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:22.919
allegedly so yeah I'm pretty comfortable
qualifying hell of a boss as Independent

285
00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:25.679
Media
because

286
00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:31.020
on top of everything else
vivzipop has a habit of collaborating

287
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.580
with other independent creators in
significant ways

288
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.860
and some of these creators are people
that most corporations in their right

289
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:47.400
mind wouldn't touch with a laser pointer
and a hazmat suit

290
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.620
[Music]
who is Brandon Rogers Brandon Rogers is

291
00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.120
a YouTuber who's been around since the
site became a thing joining the platform

292
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.000
in 2006 he's best known for satirical
skits where he plays a multitude of

293
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.559
characters characters that are crass
offensive arrogant repulsive aggressive

294
00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:15.419
unsavory kind
caring touching and wait what the hell

295
00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:17.659
is this

296
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.679
you can't be offensive and touching

297
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.940
but apparently he is his channel
originally started out as simple comedy

298
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.559
sketches with recurring characters
however in recent years he's developed a

299
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.299
sort of Cinematic Universe for himself
with multi-episode series these include

300
00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:44.280
stuff and Sam blame the hero and normal
British series as well as crossover

301
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.380
one-off episodes like a day at the park
and a day at the beach with my wrestling

302
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.120
Crush Sammy Guevara even co-starring in
Helen trains a wrestler because of

303
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.100
Brandon's dedication to the joke and
ever increasing production value he's

304
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.480
lasted a lot longer on YouTube than most
of the sketch comedians that popped up

305
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.380
on the platform in the early days a
pretty damn impressive feat considering

306
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.940
a multitude of his videos are rated 18
plus by YouTube and he makes absolutely

307
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:18.659
no effort to self-censor which you'd
think might be the end of him these days

308
00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:22.919
but it seems to work in his favor
normally the phrase equal opportunity

309
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:26.940
offender can be a bit of a trigger look
at creators like Trey Parker and Matt

310
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.840
Stone of South Park and their
pseudo-libertarian approach to whom they

311
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.500
make the target of their ridicule yes
they target established Authority

312
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.299
depicting the nonchalant cruelty of
Republicans the blase ineptitude of

313
00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:43.799
Democrats showcasing the narrow balance
of police brutality and the incompetence

314
00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:48.179
of law enforcement
the series does on occasion rush to the

315
00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:51.780
defense of public figures who are
perhaps unjustly the target of media

316
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.039
mockery such as Britney Spears and at
times they use their platform to stand

317
00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:59.940
up for marginalized groups like The
episode with Stan's gay dog

318
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.080
and all of this sounds like an
upstanding responsible use of a given

319
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.220
platform if it wasn't for the Equal
Opportunity part because there is no

320
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.960
specific Target of their mockery they
target everyone there is a component of

321
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.980
their whiteness and straightness that
doesn't seem to understand how

322
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:23.039
institutions of Oppression function
and while you can deflect criticism for

323
00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:26.340
targeting elements of a minority
community's Culture by saying we're

324
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.659
making fun of everyone it doesn't take
into account a culture which is already

325
00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:34.919
passively ridiculing those same people
for instance they're falling out with

326
00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:39.320
Isaac Hayes the voice actor of staple
character Chef is indicative of this

327
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.220
although things do get a bit complicated
Chef was unknowingly racist caricature

328
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.059
that was used to often address the white
perspective of black people in small

329
00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:51.299
communities they were already threading
the needle

330
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:55.740
Isaac's sudden departure from the series
left him on very bad terms with Parker

331
00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.539
and stone only using existing dialogue
lines they wrote Chef out of the series

332
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:05.400
with a gruesome death and in the same
episode which highlighted an unspoken

333
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.380
historic precedent of English
adventurers and explorers molesting the

334
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.640
indigenous children of colonized Nations
they implicated their only reoccurring

335
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.220
black adult character a cafeteria Chef
in an elementary school as being a

336
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.820
pedophile and this is in conjunction
with a recurring polarized take on trans

337
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:33.539
people and identities ranging from
pretty okay to downright transphobic and

338
00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:37.080
also targeting and ridiculing specific
people like Al Gore and his climate

339
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.539
change advocacy which has had
detrimental and measurable real-world

340
00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:47.940
effects remember kids it's never just a
cartoon so when it comes to a

341
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:53.400
description of Brandon Rogers and his
comedic style he can also fit as an

342
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.820
equal opportunity offender but why am I
willing to criticize Parker and Stone

343
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.900
where I will praise Rogers Rogers also
has a broad range of characters which he

344
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.100
uses to style his comedy he also uses
potty and Gallows humor for his

345
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.600
carnivalesque videos Suburban moms
single spinsters gay men lesbians

346
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.380
homophobes white people black people
Asian people Hispanic people children

347
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.779
the poor the English the blind cats
social media influencers ghosts Jeff

348
00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:27.960
Goldblum closet cases and even robots
they're all lampooned skewered and torn

349
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.299
to shreds but then in odd moments of
tenderness many of them are brought down

350
00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:38.039
from their ridiculous Heights and become
surprisingly identifiable Bryce tank

351
00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:42.120
thrust a CEO turned president of the
United States turned disgraced

352
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.480
ex-president of the United States is
probably one of the best

353
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.940
characterizations of corporate evil I've
ever seen with her literally having no

354
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.679
heart and raising an army of clones just
to rip their hearts out so that she can

355
00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:59.279
keep on being the biggest [ __ ] in
America but even she has had a backstory

356
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:05.640
developed that humanizes her because in
the world that Brandon Rogers creates no

357
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.980
one is above being made fun of and
almost no one is too low to sympathize

358
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:16.200
with Rogers himself is gay and of
Portuguese Filipino Scottish and Spanish

359
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.539
descent so he gets a pass for
pretty much everyone that he makes fun

360
00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:24.840
of in his videos but even though he's a
gay man of color who successfully broken

361
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.340
into the insult comic World dominated by
straight white men and also broken the

362
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.360
rules and made it better in my humble
opinion not all gay people are all too

363
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.919
fond of his videos it's hard not to find
gays on Twitter Reddit or Tumblr to

364
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:42.960
crying him is bad for the community and
giving gays a bad name he's too crass

365
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.940
too juvenile not setting a good example
not being a good gay as it were I don't

366
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.919
know what you do with these but I know
you people will that's a vacuum yes but

367
00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:57.480
what do they use it for in fact
doesn't he seem to just represent all

368
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.760
the things that we try to avoid putting
forth the absolute wrongest version of

369
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.539
our community to show to The Straits but
on the other hand doesn't it just get

370
00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:12.419
exhausting to put on all of these errors
for the sake of impressing the straights

371
00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:16.140
why do we have to be biting our tongue
like it's Thanksgiving dinner with

372
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.260
relatives who think it's important to
get a Republican president every now and

373
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.960
then just to balance out the Democrats
and who is the we

374
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.820
that is deciding what we should and
should not depict

375
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:38.279
to the CIS hetero hegemony
[Music]

376
00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:43.440
queer people are put off by Brandon
Rogers usually the same group of people

377
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.600
who don't like being locked into the
lgbtq umbrella term there's a

378
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.919
sensibility in the community itself that
feels that Roger's crass explicit

379
00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:57.960
YouTube videos are in detriment to the
community because golly gee what are the

380
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.440
straights gonna think of us if we aren't
showing them that we can be just as

381
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.640
straight as them or straighter if at all
possible

382
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.380
putting on an act that will earn us
acceptance into the hetero hegemony

383
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.720
should not be the sensibilities that we
use as a foundation

384
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.520
we had to create this community and
queer enclaves to protect ourselves from

385
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.200
this group of people in the first place
and now we are going to put ourselves

386
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:31.380
under such massive duress just to avoid
backlash from them if that weren't the

387
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:37.380
case we would ask a different question
one that does not require an answer why

388
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.000
shouldn't Brandon Rogers make his videos
make 2023 the first year where we

389
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.779
stopped saying that one Rogue queer with
no straight social filter is somehow

390
00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:50.580
sabotaging everyone else's rights all
that does is point out how fickle the

391
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.440
hegemony's morality is and that we ought
to hold them to a higher standard not us

392
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.919
meanwhile have we really sat down and
asked ourselves if playing to straight

393
00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:06.659
standards is a fantastic idea and when I
say straight I do mean cisgender and

394
00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:11.940
heterosexual I do acknowledge that a lot
of trans people are heterosexual

395
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.440
but like a bisexual person telling
everyone they're gay just to save time I

396
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.860
have places that I'm trying to go with
this see the problem with an appeal to

397
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.440
The Straits is that they don't really
know how we want to be seen which

398
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.240
results in a lot of CIS people believing
that Blair white is a shining example of

399
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.620
trans visibility the problem here is
that it is easy to receive praise and

400
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.520
recognition among the hegemonistic
cultures by telling them that there is

401
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.679
no onus on them to change or adapt
playing to the crowd as it were whereas

402
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:47.100
to make any strides in visibility you
have to be willing to challenge

403
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.320
convention the message we need to send
to truly gain strides in the fight for

404
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.440
our rights is that people do not need to
live by this rockwellian set of nuclear

405
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.179
family values to be fine I certainly
hope that as Rogers becomes more

406
00:32:03.179 --> 00:32:07.620
prolific and prominent that he does not
face more backlash for developing the

407
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:12.120
kind of content he wants to produce
on one hand

408
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.500
he yes does make content that seems
highly indicative of lowbrow YouTube

409
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:21.240
skit comedy which can often amount to
men in bad drags screaming for no reason

410
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.020
however Rogers is capable of
demonstrating a great deal of Technical

411
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.399
and narrative skill in the development
of these videos as far as there is a lot

412
00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:33.840
of shrieking in these skits his dialogue
has a punch characters are well

413
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.460
developed and he makes good use of
visual cues and regardless of how

414
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.020
chaotic they seem they all drive toward
a straightforward theme for instance

415
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.860
he's one of the only creators I can
think of who's pulled off time travel

416
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:52.320
well but most importantly all of his
characters no matter how outrageous are

417
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.179
indicative of a kind of humanity at
their core they are identifiable on a

418
00:32:57.179 --> 00:33:00.720
personal level in a way where you can
say

419
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.860
I know that person
even if the person you're thinking of

420
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:10.740
does not go quite so hard
where did you get vodka one more time in

421
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.500
Mama's mouth ultimately this is the
clear separation between the likes of

422
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.539
Parker and stone and Rogers both can be
offensive satire however South Park can

423
00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:25.620
have a tendency to be personally
insulting rather than Rogers whose

424
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:29.940
insults are not quite so personal if I
were to qualify it I would say that the

425
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.419
difference would be Roger's comedy
targets Trends or behaviors themselves

426
00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:38.340
and even if they are indicative of a
particular identity the identity is not

427
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.019
the target merely their behavior he
humanizes his characters while he's

428
00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:47.399
making fun of them while targeting
expressions of an identity care is taken

429
00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:52.559
not to invalidate the identity
it is the character that is comedic

430
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:57.419
whereas South Park functions well when
it's making fun of white straight people

431
00:33:57.419 --> 00:34:01.740
because in the show there are still
redeemable White characters to be found

432
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.159
with a limited cast of diverse
characters and a set of narrative

433
00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:10.139
framing devices that paint these
communities with broad Strokes the

434
00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:15.359
identity itself becomes the target
there's no rationale or cultural context

435
00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:20.040
for why these people act the way they do
simply holding up the behavior and

436
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:26.040
saying isn't this weird see how peculiar
this is look at this gay guy wearing a

437
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.740
harness
ah

438
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.000
those homosexuals it's not a secret that
people of privilege have difficulty

439
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.440
separating a criticism of behavior from
a criticism of identity keep in mind

440
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.540
Born This Way was a message that was not
projected to them until February of

441
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.200
2011. those are privilege are so
accustomed to joining in ridicule of

442
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.760
other people that the second someone
makes fun of a component of white people

443
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:56.099
there is a widespread right-wing
backlash about how some how whiteness

444
00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:00.119
and Santa Claus are under attack I don't
like them putting chemicals in the water

445
00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:05.160
that turn the freaking frogs gay is the
inability to navigate these nuances a

446
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:10.079
component of privilege or is it
something conditioned by living in

447
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:15.420
privilege meanwhile successful satire
tends to hold a reverence for the target

448
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:20.160
of ridicule Tina Fey's method of doing
this for instance is to make fun of the

449
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.260
person doing the ridiculing just as much
as the target of Comedy or to ridicule

450
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.359
the act of ridicule itself but at the
core all subjects of mockery need to be

451
00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:34.859
put in the context of their own Humanity
I feel this is indicative of why exactly

452
00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:39.900
hell of a boss holds so much impact as a
writer on most episodes Rogers seems to

453
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.040
be aware of how these characters can
reach such carnivalesque Heights while

454
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.000
at the same time keeping them
identifiable this sets the stage for

455
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.900
when he steps away from the writer's
chair for episodes that are intended to

456
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.000
be more personal and empathetic
medrano's brand without them being

457
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.380
tonally jarring suffice to say hell of a
boss's ability to play both camps

458
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.000
exceptionally well makes it stand out in
a way that is refreshing to see

459
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.560
especially in an era where there is more
and more social pressure to go through

460
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.240
corporate channels to generate media
because on the other side of an unspoken

461
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.260
shame directed at those who have the
Moxie gumption coordination Drive

462
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.140
determination grit skill talent and
persist to produce their own media

463
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.940
independent of a corporate structure and
agenda there's a very loudly spoken

464
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.940
praise
for those

465
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.480
of us especially for minority
communities

466
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.270
who managed to convince a CEO
to let us make our media

467
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:48.900
[Music]
when it comes to the success of Ipsy Pop

468
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.400
animation and especially the prominence
of Medrano and Rogers as YouTube

469
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.560
creators there's a discussion to be had
about why queer content doesn't seem to

470
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.380
translate onto the big screen as well as
being touch and go with cable TV whereas

471
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.359
our visibility seems to thrive on
streaming and on media sharing platforms

472
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:12.599
like YouTube it seems like the smaller
the screen

473
00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:17.700
the more liable we are to thrive there's
an under discussed discourse for why

474
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.020
this may be the easiest suggestion and
this is Hollywood's favorite is that gay

475
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.060
stories just don't make money sure we
are a relatively small community

476
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.400
but so are so many other communities who
receive a wide range of representation

477
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.740
in film and what it comes down to is
that no we don't really turn out to

478
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:43.500
support movies that purport to represent
us but I think the answer for why is

479
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.940
more complicated than we've been led to
believe there were three prime examples

480
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:53.760
in 2022 two of which failed primarily
due to neglect Studios under promoting

481
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.619
these films to a point where reporting
on strange worlds opening weekend box

482
00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:01.859
office bomb
was the first time a lot of people had

483
00:38:01.859 --> 00:38:05.579
even heard of the movie meanwhile it
went to number one on Disney plus Fire

484
00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:12.119
Island was sent to Hulu to die both of
these are Disney's Fault by the way

485
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:16.260
shocker and yes gay people are going to
get blamed for this for whatever reason

486
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:23.220
but I would instead like to confront
my own community

487
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:29.400
with why we quote unquote let Billy
eichner's Bros flop for its theatrical

488
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.820
release boiler alert I actually
literally could not bring myself to

489
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:37.079
finish watching Bros it was that bad I
had to read a synopsis of the last 20

490
00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:41.099
minutes which did not help a breakdown
of bros really isn't necessary if you

491
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:46.680
know who Eichner is imagine that but in
a plot that tries to frame him as

492
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:52.440
endearing somehow
imagine a regular rom-com but gay and

493
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:57.420
lacking narrative cohesion and without
tonal consistency and an unnecessary

494
00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.720
amount of f-bombs and no less than four
sex scenes involving him and Incredibly

495
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.359
attractive white guys this combined
earned the film and hard R rating which

496
00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:13.560
it seems quite proud of in spite of the
fact that that limits the potential

497
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.700
theatrical audience Eichner is
desperately trying to be both Tina Fey

498
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.500
and Larry Kramer however he's too
arrogant to direct criticism at himself

499
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.000
yet too insecure to say anything
actually provocative but regardless of

500
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.839
the fact that R-rated films have been
shown to perform quite well at the box

501
00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:35.700
office especially if made for a moderate
budget Bros underperformed to a point of

502
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.440
Eichner
explicitly citing homophobia as the sole

503
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:47.280
reason for why the film failed Okay so
why didn't your own people go see it

504
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.420
then Billy make no mistake the queer
demographic is relatively small for now

505
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.640
however we in conjunction with a broader
audience who are interested in queer

506
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.420
characters and stories were invested
enough to give hell of a boss the kind

507
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.220
of views on YouTube which would have
any television executive wetting their

508
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.420
pants given that both hell of a boss and
Bros have a similar comfort with curse

509
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.920
words and sexuality why is one so much
more successful than the other

510
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.540
regardless of the platform a hell of a
boss is just ubiquitously more

511
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.640
successful and it was made without the
stamp of approval from a major studio

512
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.960
and most importantly why do queer
audiences gravitate towards the YouTube

513
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.480
show so strongly whereas queer audiences
were likely to turn away from Bros a

514
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.119
common argument is that queer people
aren't comfortable going to see queer

515
00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:39.839
movies in theaters the outdoor Journey
to the cinema May attract the prying

516
00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:43.560
eyes of homophobes that it's safer and
emotionally easier to just watch things

517
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.000
on TV even as Bros receive glowing
reviews from critics why were queer

518
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.700
audiences so turned off by it my
explanation is that this was a movie at

519
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.099
its narrative core about gay love and
Eichner giving his character the

520
00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:01.980
opportunity to sleep with several
ridiculously attractive men while the

521
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.940
film claims to to decry these values
which is made abundantly Apparent at the

522
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.020
beginning of the film Eichner builds a
normative concept of gay love which is

523
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.760
outstandingly similar to straight love
gay people may not appreciate this

524
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.619
message because gay love itself is not a
monolith at least not the monolith that

525
00:41:19.619 --> 00:41:22.980
straight love can be thing is without
the rudder of social etiquette

526
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:28.500
milestones we develop our own ways and
our relationship structures can be quite

527
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.339
varied throwing gender dependent
coupling to the wind there's a lack of

528
00:41:32.339 --> 00:41:36.720
clarity regarding what roles two people
may occupy in a romance trying to

529
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.700
develop the quintessential gay love
story is impossible because every gay

530
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.320
person approaches love in a way that is
defined by their distance from

531
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.359
heterosexual coupling and in this Bros
tries to present itself as this

532
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:57.599
quintessential story in developing this
new heterotangential gay hegemony I

533
00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:01.560
could foresee these opinions about Bros
or any other media that seeks to make a

534
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.599
normative argument about this ours is in
straight love let me tell you what our

535
00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:12.420
love is I can see many people simply
feeling that one white homosexual CIS

536
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.820
man living in New York City does not
have the right to Define that bro's

537
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.540
narrative through line instead is that
growing up

538
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:27.839
in one's approach to relationships means
monogamy as that is the success factor

539
00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:34.140
of the story it moralizes monogamous
love normatively aggrandizing itself or

540
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.980
criticizing media that promotes
heterotypical love while making a

541
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:43.260
mockery out of anything that is even
slightly out of the CIS heteronorm Rose

542
00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.520
ends up being a broad Strokes normative
description about the moralistic

543
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.740
direction in which gay men apparently
ought to direct their lives again

544
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.839
people who were pushed from the hegemony
who in turn had to create their own

545
00:42:57.839 --> 00:43:04.020
identities do not like being told what
their identity should be like Billy

546
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.880
eichner's character in Bros Bobby the
movie spends far too much time insulting

547
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.800
the people who it then demands support
from and Eichner does expect to be

548
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.660
celebrated in spite of the fact that he
spends the entire movie being critical

549
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.040
of everybody people let alone gay people
generally don't like that eichner's

550
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.460
attitude during the movie's promotion
didn't seem to help he went around

551
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.599
making statements indicating that this
was the first gay movie that mattered he

552
00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:35.040
didn't say it was the first gay movie
but he did claim that it was the first

553
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.319
gay romantic comedy to be produced by a
large studio which is also wrong but the

554
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:44.520
statement did seem to imply that prior
gay movies the ones that kept us going

555
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.720
through his Century of persecution
seemed to matter less than this one

556
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.680
eichner's very public
self-congratulatory statements well

557
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:59.099
off-putting to queer people did a lot to
intrinsically tie this movie to

558
00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:03.540
queerness in a way that was not done
with say Strange World between the two

559
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:09.060
critics seemed to be much more
comfortable celebrating Bros and after

560
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.760
watching the quality of Bros

561
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.060
okay I have some filmmaker stuff I need
to get off my chest Rose was shot with a

562
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.020
kind of lens called an anamorphic lens
these lenses are very expensive and

563
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.839
difficult to work with they make the
shot wider by shrinking the image like

564
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:32.040
what happens when you squeeze a JPEG in
Photoshop and then the editor has to

565
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.300
properly de-squeeze the image in
post-production anamorphic lenses are

566
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:43.140
used to generate incredibly dramatic
impactful visuals that are often what

567
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:48.359
people would consider cinematic I have
no idea why Bros needed to be shot with

568
00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:52.440
these lenses
and they messed it up while I was

569
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.520
watching it I noticed that the image
wasn't de-squeezed properly

570
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.119
it's nothing that literally like anyone
would notice except people who know what

571
00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:04.859
to look for but seriously this is not a
movie that requires fancy camera lenses

572
00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:10.440
used to shoot movies like Lawrence of
Arabia and the Lord of the Rings anyway

573
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.640
taking stock of the technical skills and
talent that went into Bros the only

574
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.540
reason I think that it was received as
positively as it was is because critics

575
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.680
were afraid of being accused of being
homophobic for giving it an honest

576
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.599
review and while I can't know for
certain Eichner certainly made a point

577
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:31.800
of accusing everyone in the world minus
the 15 people who actually saw the damn

578
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.300
thing of being homophobic I can foresee
a few critics maybe being afraid that if

579
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.619
they gave it the good old thumbs down
Eichner would have personally showed up

580
00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:43.800
at their doorstep with a baseball bat
and four out of the Five Guys from queer

581
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.240
eye what does confuse me about Bros and
this is going to seem generalized is the

582
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:54.720
movie itself Bros as a project
confuses me from a creative side the

583
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.040
film is designed to Lampoon a very real
precedent of queer media kowtowing to a

584
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.760
heteronormative standard while at the
same time Being Framed through a

585
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.720
heteronormative love story format all
the while the film itself pushes for

586
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.040
queer Independence while the creative
team was very proud of themselves for

587
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.240
using one of the largest film studios in
the world to validate it if queer

588
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.500
creators are in need of creative
Liberation from hetero establishment

589
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.540
expectations and formats

590
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:29.280
why was it so damn important to get made
by one of the largest

591
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.280
heteroestablishments

592
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:38.480
in Hollywood
[Music]

593
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.800
for all bros seem to Pride itself on
being the gay movie

594
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.599
it certainly doesn't reach very far to
accommodate the people it claims to want

595
00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:53.400
to service
and definitely expects that audiences do

596
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.839
the heavy lifting in this relationship
with the media and yet aside from living

597
00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:01.920
in this fictitious self-insertion wish
fulfillment world of fiction where

598
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:08.040
everybody likes Billy I mean Bobby and
takes him seriously every stop is pulled

599
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:12.300
to validate straight opinions of queer
identities don't worry Straits you know

600
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.140
all those weird things about gay culture
like polyamory and being comfortably

601
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.359
single into your 40s and you know how
queer people are just constantly arguing

602
00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:25.920
about privilege
yeah don't worry it is dumb and

603
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:31.680
dysfunctional I said so if Eichner
really was intent on making Bros for us

604
00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.940
queer people then he wouldn't have
blamed straight people for why it

605
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.180
flopped
and in the end Bros fits the definition

606
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.780
of exactly what it claimed it was
different from

607
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:48.420
a gay movie made for the bemusement and
celebration of straight people but if

608
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:54.119
Eichner was sincere in wanting to create
media that speaks two and four the queer

609
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:57.720
community
then that dream was always going to be

610
00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.040
hobbled by a big Hollywood producer for
whom this community is a demographic on

611
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.980
a chart and a small one compared to the
straight white men and women aged 18 to

612
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.960
56. more confusing still is the fact
that this group of Executives and

613
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.980
creative decision makers who think they
know something about what audiences want

614
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.640
in spite of Landing their job after
coming from the microwave division that

615
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.619
insists that flops like Bros are proof
positive that there's just no demand for

616
00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:30.119
queer content meanwhile roll over to
vivzipop's YouTube channel and find

617
00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:34.560
views that any television producer would
ritualistically sacrifice their first

618
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.460
and second born to translate into
ratings

619
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:43.980
no demand no demand
none

620
00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.780
apparently and hell of a boss sashayed
right past the limits of bold language

621
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.020
and sexuality that Bros stopped at
all the while this show does incorporate

622
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.640
queer aesthetic sensibilities and does
feel comfortable digging into the issues

623
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:05.579
affected by queerness and do all the
things that Bros cannot or will not do

624
00:49:05.579 --> 00:49:09.839
because its narrative structure is
predicated on the limits of what a

625
00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:14.520
corporate body will let it do though her
platform is self-made and much smaller

626
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.079
Medrano has reached more audiences than
an overwhelming majority of creators who

627
00:49:19.079 --> 00:49:24.540
make as would be considered by many the
right kind of queer content so why is

628
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.400
Corporate made media put on such a high
pedestal why do we have to organize our

629
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:34.079
community to watch Oscar bait [ __ ]
and generic rom-coms but with gay

630
00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:38.339
characters under the promise that if we
show everyone that this can be a success

631
00:49:38.339 --> 00:49:41.880
then maybe they will actually give us
something we want never mind that wild

632
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.560
cats like Medrano and Rogers have been
there the whole time building content

633
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:52.859
that already speaks to us on their own
Medrano is demonstrating that their is

634
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:57.060
social currency for Niche content to
thrive in spite of every media executive

635
00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:02.280
except at a24 apparently saying it could
never sell is it for everyone

636
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:09.000
no should it be for everyone no
the problem with corporate media is that

637
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.400
it needs to be for everyone meanwhile
this is the space for Prestige

638
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.260
where everyone wants to be
where we're told this is where you need

639
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:24.240
to go to know that you've made it
this is the coveted spot

640
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.480
this is where you want to move your
career

641
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:32.400
this is the big leagues could it really
be just about getting a bigger paycheck

642
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.440
or is there some kind of subliminal
thought process that by being contracted

643
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.180
by a straight executive it means we're
overcoming persecution

644
00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.680
or maybe individual creators feel more
validated by a single executive than by

645
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.700
the praise of a large fan base but what
about the single executive's opinion is

646
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.319
more important than a whole audience
feeling seen by your art why is there

647
00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:59.099
still such a rat race to impress
Executives when people like Medrano and

648
00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:03.180
other independent creators are proving
that you can make a living by producing

649
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:08.640
the kind of media that you want to make
in the first place

650
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.960
making good art isn't at odds with
making a living

651
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:20.400
why is external approval so important
there was one

652
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.119
one
cohesive message that came out of Disney

653
00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:28.559
Pixar's Cars
that there is integrity and value in the

654
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:32.700
slow lane that by chasing the more
lucrative contract the prestigious brand

655
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:38.160
you end up missing so much and leaving
behind the people who may mean a lot to

656
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.339
you
an entire movie designed to sell

657
00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:45.240
Lightning McQueen merchandise to have
colorful settings and flashing lights

658
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:52.500
and it has this one Salient thing to say
how did so many people miss it

659
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.960
it came out 15 years ago why don't more
people of my generation

660
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.160
celebrate people

661
00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:08.780
who don't sell out
[Music]

662
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.920
having lived as a gay man for 30 some
odd years now

663
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.700
I've seen the community go through some
big changes

664
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.420
when I was a kid in the 90s I remember
seeing arguments and debates over don't

665
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.079
ask don't tell in the Defense of
Marriage Act in the United States

666
00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:31.020
I remember Ellen DeGeneres
coming out and all the chaos that

667
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.740
surrounded that

668
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.220
I can still see my mom crying while
watching the news coverage about the

669
00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:42.059
murder of Matthew Shepard
my family talking about the legal battle

670
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:48.020
here in Canada about whether or not a
boy could bring another boy to his prom

671
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.540
I watched Queer as Folk and Will and
Grace

672
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.460
opened the eyes of millions of viewers
each week

673
00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:01.200
I seethed
as George W bush tried using the gay

674
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.059
community and our marriage rights as an
election issue in 2004

675
00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:10.980
and then he won
I was shocked the night Barack Obama was

676
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:15.540
elected president of the United States
only for California of all states to

677
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.099
enshrine discrimination into their
constitution with the passage of prop 8.

678
00:53:20.099 --> 00:53:25.680
I watched and wrapped as soldier after
Soldier came forward to talk about how

679
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.480
they had been booted out of the U.S
military because they were gay

680
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.380
even though they're commanding officers
knew full well that they were gay when

681
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:39.540
they sent them on multiple tours in Iraq
and Afghanistan

682
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.980
and then a dishonorable discharge meant
that even after

683
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.540
multiple tours
they lost all their benefits and I

684
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:53.760
eventually cheered when Prop 8 was
overturned by the Supreme Court same-sex

685
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.500
marriage was legalized and the don't ask
don't tell policy was repealed all of

686
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:05.099
this was between 1993 and 2015.
that's 22 years

687
00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:09.900
the fight for gay rights had been going
on long before 1993 of course it's been

688
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:16.619
going on forever really but it feels
like in the 22 years between 93 and 2015

689
00:54:16.619 --> 00:54:22.680
that gay rights really went mainstream
since 93 we've watched as politicians

690
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.000
like Joe Biden voted against our rights
by voting for the Defense of Marriage

691
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.800
Act and we watched as he as the
President of the United States fully

692
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:37.920
repealed the statute in 2022 when he
signed the respect for Marriage Act

693
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.940
it's not politics if it's character
development that was sarcasm by the way

694
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.200
pay attention to voting records not just
what people say we saw gay characters

695
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.579
only being allowed on TV after a certain
time of night and movies almost

696
00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:56.220
universally being rated R if they had a
gay character to Disney releasing a 200

697
00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.960
million dollar animated movie with a gay
lead character

698
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:07.740
even if they did neglect to Market it
we saw lgbtq literature go from existing

699
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.700
on the fringes with people rushing out
of tiny bookstores with non-descript

700
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:15.059
paper bags containing copies of books by
authors like Christopher isherwood

701
00:55:15.059 --> 00:55:20.460
Radcliffe Hall and James Baldwin
to queer Y.A books becoming Global

702
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:25.740
bestsellers and inspiring hit TV shows
though we've certainly run into some

703
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:30.660
setbacks
the progress has seemed rapid and

704
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.440
unprecedented
at least that's what the straights say

705
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.220
they don't seem to realize that people
were fighting for gay rights before the

706
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:43.800
Clinton Administration but if you look
at the queer community of today

707
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.700
and the queer community of the pre-aids
era

708
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:52.859
it feels like there's something missing
not just the tens of thousands of

709
00:55:52.859 --> 00:55:57.839
Brilliant Minds talented artists and
loving people who we've lost to that

710
00:55:57.839 --> 00:56:04.079
disease but a sense of something else
the shamelessness

711
00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:08.280
the be whoever you want to be attitude
that perpetuated within the community

712
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.180
before
fighting for our very lives and hospital

713
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.240
beds became the only fight we could
fight

714
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.380
it's telling I think
that once protease Inhibitors had

715
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.720
reached the market and an HIV diagnosis
was no longer a death sentence

716
00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.319
the battles that rose out of the AIDS
epidemic

717
00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:32.160
for gay people
where access to marriage and military

718
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:37.140
service when Once the queer Community
was focused on creating the best art and

719
00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:44.460
living lives worth telling stories about
the 1990s brought on a new goal

720
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:48.359
how best to fit in
as the brilliant friend Leibowitz has

721
00:56:48.359 --> 00:56:52.500
said many times the first people who
died of AIDS were the interesting ones

722
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:57.420
the artists
there's a reason that Art became

723
00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:03.000
Ghostbusters and cats in the 1980s
because all of the really talented

724
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.680
artists were dying
the rule Breakers ones who weren't

725
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:13.380
afraid to shake things up
and the audience died with them

726
00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.940
now we don't have any kind of discerning
audience when that audience died and

727
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.359
that audience died in five minutes
literally people didn't die faster in a

728
00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:24.780
war
and it allowed of course like the second

729
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.640
third fourth tier to rise up to the
front because of course the first people

730
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:34.740
who died of AIDS were the people who
I don't know how to put this got laid a

731
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:41.040
lot okay now imagine who didn't get AIDS
that's who was then lauded as like the

732
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.720
great artists so many of the gays Left
Alive once the Clinton Administration

733
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:51.720
came into being were to be frank
the boring ones the gays who knew nobody

734
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.380
and who nobody knew
and they Rose to the top of the

735
00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:00.420
community and therefore their priorities
Rose to the top of the community as well

736
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:05.640
and what did they want apparently
they wanted to join the Army and have

737
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.480
big gay weddings
General employment non-discrimination

738
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.339
wasn't all that important to them
making sexuality and gender identity a

739
00:58:14.339 --> 00:58:19.260
protected class along with sex race and
religion wasn't that important to them

740
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:24.480
they wanted marriage and Military
because they were the good gays

741
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.460
not the naughty gays who were sleeping
around and dying of AIDS

742
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:33.839
not the poor gays who couldn't make
political contributions

743
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:37.980
they were the gays with families and
commitment ceremonies and office jobs

744
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:42.839
and houses
they were the good ones

745
00:58:42.839 --> 00:58:48.359
the ones who would look fantastic and
Incredibly marketable when they were

746
00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:53.040
interviewed by CNN they were the gays
whose straight people would look at and

747
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:57.299
say to themselves
maybe they're not so bad after all

748
00:58:57.299 --> 00:59:02.400
I still don't want my kid to be gay but
maybe it's okay if Bob and Henry got

749
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:09.000
married the gay rights movement shifted
from accept us for who we are to will be

750
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.020
whatever you want us to be if you accept
us

751
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:17.280
and it's kind of remained that way over
the last 30 years

752
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.660
we've been trained to be offended by
queers who step too far out of the

753
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:27.000
mainstream plenty and I mean plenty of
gays online were on edge when Billy

754
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Porter started showing up to Awards
throws and dresses lots and I mean Lots

755
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.200
of gays were unnerved and worried when
trans people started coming out of their

756
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.640
own closets
some going so far as to disavow the T

757
00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:47.220
from the LGBT because they were worried
people who don't like trans people would

758
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.420
Lop in the gay men and women in with
them who needs Community when you've

759
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.819
already got your house in the suburbs
right

760
00:59:53.819 --> 00:59:59.940
and so so so so many gays will rise up
in a social media tornado at the first

761
00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.420
sight of a problematic queer showing up
somewhere in Media and I'm not even

762
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:08.400
talking about like serial killers like
Dahmer or Buffalo Bill I mean I just

763
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.079
mean the [ __ ] gays being anywhere near
a sex positive as Samantha was on Sex in

764
01:00:13.079 --> 01:00:17.400
the City 20 years ago could lead to a
gay character in today's day and age

765
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.480
being canceled for not being a good role
model for the community the queer

766
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:27.059
Community is one that's made up of oddly
shaped characters all being forced to

767
01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:33.420
fit into these perfectly square boxes
built by the men who wanted marriage and

768
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.920
Military over protected rights for
everyone so it's been absolutely

769
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.000
revelatory
for me born right around the time the

770
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.819
good gays started taking control to see
some bad gaze being naughty in media and

771
01:00:47.819 --> 01:00:52.440
having a blast doing it Brandon Rogers
has been the antithesis of the good gays

772
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.640
in those old gay marriage commercials
for about 15 years now and his videos

773
01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:00.299
are just getting better and more complex
as time goes on

774
01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:04.980
giving us queer characters that
mainstream media would be far far too

775
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.960
squeamish to portray fizzy Pop's
expanding world of hell has given us

776
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:16.319
queer assassins queer princes of Hell
queer demonic drug addicts and the queer

777
01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:20.579
daughter of Lucifer Lilith themselves
who just wants to help people meanwhile

778
01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:26.700
Hollywood gives us annoying gaze
dying gaze and gaze they refuse to

779
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.119
Market
James is this another video where you

780
01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:33.059
say we should support independent
creators in studios instead of

781
01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:37.040
supporting the giant Hollywood
conglomerates

782
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.220
yes asking Hollywood to give us fun
Earnest and meaningful representation

783
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:50.520
only for them to puke out Bros and then
still beg these producers it's like

784
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.319
begging a [ __ ] ex-boyfriend to take
you back because you feel lonely

785
01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:59.099
even if he does say yes you think it's
not gonna suck

786
01:01:59.099 --> 01:02:04.440
it is meanwhile there's a horde of
people begging for your attention that

787
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.940
we as a whole Community have managed to
ignore altogether some YouTubers are

788
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:13.440
making Funnier videos than anything
Hollywood's been spitting out lately

789
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.020
some production companies are making
queer inclusive content so good

790
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.540
it's the front runner for every Best
Picture award this season even though it

791
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:30.240
came out last March so in 2023 I think
we need to make a promise to search out

792
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.359
and watch some more independent queer
media

793
01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:38.640
and stop jumping for joy every time
Marvel happens to cast a queer actor I'd

794
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.839
say we're a long way off from Disney
producing anything nearly as Queer as

795
01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:46.079
the 2013 Young Avengers run by Kieran
Gillen

796
01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:50.880
holding your breath for this is only
going to turn you blue support queer

797
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.880
creators on patreon by independently
published books by queer authors stream

798
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.040
web series by queer video producers and
watch all the queer movies and series

799
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.240
that somehow make their way onto major
streaming services like Netflix and

800
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.059
Amazon support it all yes even if you
find it offensive

801
01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:16.200
because if you think queer characters
should be beacons of great decision

802
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.299
making and career choices
if you think queer characters need to be

803
01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:28.319
models to show off to the Straits
The Straits who hate us in 2023

804
01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:32.520
are still gonna hate us if we come
across as perfect or flawed so let's

805
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.839
stop caring what they think of us and
live our lives the way we want to

806
01:03:36.839 --> 01:03:43.500
without asking for their acceptance
or their permission it's time we start

807
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.760
hearing the message that corporations
and other media Gatekeepers refuse to

808
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.299
say
that you are enough

809
01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:56.040
that you have intrinsic value without
Authority's validation

810
01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:01.260
that there are people who want your
stories your art and your feelings

811
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.040
maybe they'll be a little rough around
the edges but maybe that's better

812
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.960
because of the real raw unadulterated
place it comes from the most Hollywood

813
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.619
producers or Executives could never
understand

814
01:04:13.619 --> 01:04:18.720
but for which
there may be an audience who will feel

815
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:25.260
seen by these stories
and we'll see you in return

816
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:30.059
it's time for us to start considering
whose opinions about us actually matter

817
01:04:30.059 --> 01:04:36.059
and to start seeing ourselves as we are
as Worthy

818
01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:44.059
because you're worth so much more
than a column on a spreadsheet
