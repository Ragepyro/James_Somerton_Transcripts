00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.570
so the hollywood summer movie season is
drawing to a close and the prevailing

2
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.539
message at the summer seems to be
according to industry professionals at

3
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.050
least that people are getting tired of
the summer blockbuster with a few

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
exceptions like x-men days of future
past guardians of the galaxy in the new

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.830
Ninja Turtles movie almost every medium
to large budgeted movie has

6
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.579
underperformed especially at the
domestic box office this is leading a

7
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.969
lot of people in Hollywood to wonder
what went wrong why aren't people going

8
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.690
to see movies anymore and why aren't
they going to see movies more than once

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.620
the economy isn't nearly as bad as it
was in 2009 and that was the year I

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
avatar made almost 3 billion dollars so
what the hell is going on here well the

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.760
answer is pretty simple really people
aren't sick of blockbusters they're not

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.269
sick of fantasy movie science fiction
comedies horror superheroes westerns

13
00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.500
disaster movies vampires werewolves or
giant monsters people are sick of paying

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
good money to see bad movies the first
example that comes to mind is this

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
summer's amazing spider-man 2 back in
2002 Sony basically gave the superhero

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
genre the shot of adrenaline it needed
with Sam Raimi's spider-man and followed

17
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
it up in 2004 with what was probably the
best superhero movie at the time

18
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.259
spider-man 2 and those movies made a ton
of money for the studio but after a bad

19
00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710
end of the original trilogy and a reboot
that didn't seem to have legs the

20
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.400
amazing spider-man 2 seemed be grasping
at straws okay the movie wasn't terrible

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.640
but it wasn't nearly as good as any of
the other Marvel inspired movies that

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.210
came out this year watching it you could
tell that Sony was more interested in

23
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.750
building up a world that they could spin
off into a cinematic universe than they

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.850
were with telling a strong engaging
cohesive story the Rhino was horrible

25
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.600
electro seemed like he belonged in a
joel schumacher Batman movie and the

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.619
Green Goblin should have been saved
until the third installment granted Gwen

27
00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
Stacy's final scene was fantastic really
heartbreaking but then they had to go

28
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.689
and ruin it with another scene with that
god-awful rhino and Sony movie goers

29
00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860
noticed these imperfections why would
they go again why would they tell their

30
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.579
friends to go why should they you made a
subpar movie that despite some great

31
00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.120
work from Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone
seems like nothing more than a soulless

32
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.190
cash grab before you launch the Spidey
Cinematic Universe was it fun sure

33
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.730
what I pay to see it again probably not
so of course now the press is saying

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.630
that people are sick of blockbusters and
many saying that there is now spider-man

35
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.530
fatigue give me a break or not sick a
spider-man we're sick of you using him

36
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.200
as a money-printing machine without
actually caring about the characters in

37
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
the world are we sick of blockbusters no
are we sick of superhero movies

38
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.390
obviously not but it's not like it
couldn't happen there was a science

39
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920
fiction explosion after Star Wars came
out in 1977 every producer a movie

40
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.430
studio wanted to throw their hat in the
ring a few good movies came out of it

41
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
like Ridley Scott's alien but there was
a whole lot of crap turned out of

42
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.390
Hollywood science fiction mass
production machine they went from B

43
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.900
movies to Z movies and people got sick
of it Hollywood didn't care about the

44
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.140
quality of the movies as long as they
got as many of them out while star wars

45
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
still burn bright eventually people
stopped going to see these trashy

46
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.040
knockoffs though and Hollywood said
obviously people aren't interested in

47
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.850
science fiction anymore and they stopped
green-lighting sci-fi movies Blade

48
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.300
Runner was a sad casualty of this a
fantastic movie that just happened to

49
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.570
get released right around the time when
audiences had had enough of the

50
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.770
Hollywood crap fest it happened again in
the 1980s with slasher movies Halloween

51
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.610
officially ushered in the age of the
slasher in 1978 followed by friday the

52
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.110
13th and 1980 and a nightmare on elm
street in 1984 so Hollywood started

53
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.290
churning out slasher movies by the Dozen
and like the science-fiction trend

54
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
before them they dropped lower and lower
in quality until people stopped going to

55
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.940
see them they lived a bit longer because
of the direct video market but they died

56
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.769
to Hollywood said that the slasher was
dead until screen came along in 1996 and

57
00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.580
breathe new life into the genre only to
have its throat cut quickly again

58
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.090
because of the hundred scream clones
that came out in the coming years horror

59
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.810
had another renaissance in the early
2000s wood saw but then had countless

60
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.530
torture porn copycats rushed to the box
office and history repeated itself yet

61
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.280
again the exact same thing happened to
westerns back in Hollywood's golden age

62
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.760
and fantasy movies after the release of
Lord of the Rings has this happened with

63
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
superhero movies hell no has this
happened to spider-man not quite yet but

64
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.880
I think sony has to be careful it's not
the spider-man has over saturated the

65
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.410
market is that the last three spider-man
movies just haven't been that good x-men

66
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.800
went through this a few years ago The
Last Stand made a ton of money off the

67
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.120
goodwill from x2 but people hated it it
took almost a decade for the x-men

68
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000
movies to get
back into the audience's good graces

69
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.640
over the last couple of years Warner
Brothers has been shocked that their DC

70
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.510
adaptations haven't blown the box office
wide open it's not that people don't

71
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.010
like your characters it's that you don't
do a good job bringing them to the big

72
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.510
screen except with Batman most of the
time the saddest thing about all of this

73
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.540
is that it's we the audience that
basically gets punished for Hollywood's

74
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.800
mistakes we lose out on seeing some
amazing movies because Hollywood thinks

75
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.490
that their genres aren't in right now
science fiction with the exception of

76
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.240
Star Wars has been on the outs as far as
Hollywood is concerned since the early

77
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.260
eighties but avatar the highest grossing
movie of all time is a science fiction

78
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.280
movie guardians of the galaxy opened
well above expectations and is the

79
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.990
definition of science fiction full bore
fantasy movies were verboten for decades

80
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.580
then Along Came lord of the rings no
matter what genre is if there is care

81
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.060
put into the production if there's
relatable characters a great story some

82
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.500
real emotion we will go see your movie
and if it's awesome we will go see you

83
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.100
twice 34 times hell I went to see The
Dark Knight five times while it was in

84
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.330
theaters and I drag people with me every
time we all do this if we love a movie

85
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.980
we tell our friends and family that they
need to see it it just has to be good so

86
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.360
Hollywood start paying attention we're
not sick of spider-man or slasher movies

87
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.100
or science fiction or fantasy or
anything else we're sick of bad movies

88
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.460
make some good ones we'll go see them
okay so what do you guys think do you

89
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.820
agree with me that no matter what the
genre as long as the movies good people

90
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.940
will go see it or do you think that
people really do get sick of genres no
