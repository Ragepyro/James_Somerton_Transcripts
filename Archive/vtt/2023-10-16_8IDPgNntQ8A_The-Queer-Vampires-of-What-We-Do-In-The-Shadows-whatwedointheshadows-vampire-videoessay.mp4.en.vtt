00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.440
somehow we ended up with what we do in
the shadows and yes as the series goes

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.840
on it's been confirmed that each one of
the main characters is some variant and

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.480
intensity of queer not that it really
needed to be confirmed but it's nice to

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.199
have these outspoken queer characters

history of vampiric folklore manifests
in the modern day half the BS you see

11
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.879
they are just vampires that have thrown
terrible orgies and they are too ashamed

12
00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.399
to regain their vampire form so they
just split around shame bats BS full of

13
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.000
Shame
