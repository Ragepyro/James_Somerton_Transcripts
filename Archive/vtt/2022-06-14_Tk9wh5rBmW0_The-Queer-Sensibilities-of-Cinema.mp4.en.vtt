i would like if i may
to take you

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.599
on a strange journey
did you know that there were queer

6
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.320
characters and not just villains in
pre-haze code hollywood meaning the long

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.719
long ago hollywood for the uninitiated
however there was only a brief window of

8
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.680
time between the end of the silent film
era in 1929 and the institution of the

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.600
morally restrictive haze code in 1934
for them to exist in any real form but

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
as you'll know if you've watched
any of my other videos filmmakers

11
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.920
managed to sneak in queerness despite
the best efforts of the morally boring

12
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.920
conservatives of the time they just had
to be sneaky about it they couldn't

13
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.440
exactly show two men kissing but they
inserted their queer sensibilities into

14
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.760
these productions sensibilities that
became lovingly known

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.479
as camp
oh

16
00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.600
i'm a man well nobody's perfect

17
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.600
the gays had always been drawn to the
film industry and the divas who fed it

18
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.720
though you can't make a video talking
about mommy dearest without highlighting

19
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.200
some of her more
unflattering qualities joan crawford is

20
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.439
indicative of this as one of the only
actresses to survive the transition from

21
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.079
silent films to what were referred to as
the talkies get it because moving

22
00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.640
pictures or movies and then
they had it sound so they were talking

23
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.759
pictures
talkies joan crawford probably became

24
00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.720
the archetype of the hollywood movie
star

25
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.439
and the gays loved her for it because
she exemplified this strong femininity

26
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.759
she drew a massive fandom of gay men
which to her credit in an era when

27
00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.000
admitting gay people could even exist
would tank your career and even get you

28
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.159
arrested joan
openly supported the queer people who

29
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.520
supported her granted when it comes to
gays flocking to women who act as icons

30
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.720
some things never change joan yes her
rival betty davis judy garland catherine

31
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.520
hepburn mae west and well all the other
old school hollywood actresses you've

32
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.360
actually heard of ask cher
the gays can keep people around i

33
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.920
suppose in this era of mid-century queer
discrimination civic mistrust and

34
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.480
institutional persecution we needed a
way to propagate our culture unlike

35
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.640
other communities queer ones are
non-hereditary we are not usually born

36
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
into them because even if gay people did
manage to raise a child there was no

37
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.400
guarantee that the child would be queer
itself so film was an easy way to

38
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.640
propagate the values of our community to
future generations legends within the

39
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.400
community often suffered a tragically
short lifespan even before the aids

40
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.239
epidemic having joan crawford epitomize
poise and independence on the silver

41
00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.680
screen in spite of not being a straight
white man

42
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.400
offered a method of cultural continuity
for us probably in a similar way that

43
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.760
ancient cultures used figures of myth to
propagate a cultural identity to new

44
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.319
generations of illiterate villagers but
how did gay people of the 20th century

45
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.080
choose the myths that they did
there were no shortage of films out

46
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.280
there of those films why did we
gravitate towards such a select few

47
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.840
what was the criteria for holding these
up as relics to pass down to baby queers

48
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.560
with lesbians there was a bit of a
different process

49
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.480
writers who were usually men were so
clueless about writing women that they

50
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.319
often accidentally wrote two friends
being so close that it crossed into

51
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.200
saffic territory for which again enter
joan crawford but if that logic applied

52
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.440
to straight men
why are any number of westerns not held

53
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.680
up by the gays
because these cowboys often got

54
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.599
very close and vulnerable with each
other instead

55
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.080
we gravitated toward a very specific
iteration of femininity

56
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.360
in very specific films

57
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:47.600
[Music]
all about eve is a perfect place to

58
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.840
start like i said not the first queer
icon movie but one of the first you may

59
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.919
hear referenced a drag queen may refer
to someone as an eve harrington and you

60
00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.520
may not know what that means but what
they're doing is accusing someone of

61
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.520
putting on a pleasant face while being a
backstabbing social climbing upstart

62
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.199
who's using more established figures to
launch their own reputation kind of like

63
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.440
a gold digger but instead of money they
seek fame and recognition and she

64
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.080
chooses to latch on to marco channing
played by the betty davis margot is the

65
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.320
queen of the new york theater scene and
even in her 40s is still the highest

66
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.360
regarded stage actress in the city eve
harrington is a poor girl who attends

67
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.280
every performance she can of margo's
current show karen richards margot's

68
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.880
best friend and wife of the show's
playwright spies eve on one of these

69
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.360
nights and invites her to meet margot in
her dressing room eve is introduced as

70
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.800
an avid fan and captivates margot with
stories of her past of love heartbreak

71
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.919
sorrow and pure unadulterated love for
the theater margot brings eve on as a

72
00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.199
kind of informal personal assistant
something eve seems all too eager to do

73
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.520
waiting hand and foot on margot's whims
and it's not hard for eve to enchant

74
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.160
almost everyone in margot's inner circle
karen her husband lloyd and margot is

75
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.680
engaged to be engaged boyfriend and
director bill sampson as far as broadway

76
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.319
goes this friend group is royalty what a
coincidence that the young and sweet and

77
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.120
entirely unassuming eve harrington
managed to elbow her way in the only one

78
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.840
who thinks that the numbers aren't
adding up is margo's maid bertie coonan

79
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.440
who's there to be a good emotional
support poor and call eve out for being

80
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.560
a fake [ __ ] and soon margot descends
into a fit of assumed paranoia regarding

81
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.160
the young eve she nearly breaks up with
bill she alienates lloyd who

82
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.800
specifically writes plays for her and
threatens her entire career she's become

83
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.960
convinced that eve is trying to take her
stardom away from her

84
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.160
and though it sounds paranoid she's
entirely correct and eve's true

85
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.880
motivations eventually become clear when
eve does an interview she says some

86
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.680
particularly shady things directed at
margot and so while eve is playing her

87
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.680
game of thrones karen begins to mend
some of the tension between margot and

88
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.240
herself margot also finally accepts
bill's proposal and the grown-ups begin

89
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.560
to get their [ __ ] together eve does keep
her talons gripped and karen's husband

90
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.240
lloyd though who's one of the most
highly regarded playwrights in new york

91
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.120
city she's after a starring role that
was written for margot

92
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.360
which she feels will be her ticket to
stardom all she needs to do

93
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.720
is find a way to push margot out of the
role so as one does eve blackmails karen

94
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.080
to get her husband to steal the part
away from margot and give it to her and

95
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.880
when the film ends
eve harrington the darling pariah

96
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.280
celebrates her tony win
for the part she stole from margot now

97
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.280
exhausted in her condominium she
encounters a mild-mannered young lady

98
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.960
who absolutely idolizes her who offers
to wait on eve hand and foot

99
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.160
and eve too caught up to notice that
history is repeating itself right in

100
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.919
front of her eyes
accepts her offer all about eve is

101
00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.240
considered one of the greatest films
ever made it bags six academy awards out

102
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.960
of a total of 14 nominations a record it
still holds to this day including best

103
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.720
picture director cinematography and
screenplay it's also the only film in

104
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.800
history to get four women nominated for
acting roles including one of davis's

105
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.199
most infamous oscar snubs for additional
trivia this is also one of marilyn

106
00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.360
monroe's first films a very small role
granted but she makes an impact while

107
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.680
there are comedic elements to the film
especially margot's biting shade

108
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.759
this is a
very highly regarded dramatic film and

109
00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:31.520
yet we can see elements of this plot
being played out in modern farces that

110
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.200
are so over the top that they can be
considered beyond camp hell you might

111
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.640
see a plot line like this showing up on
a season of real housewives but that

112
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.039
isn't to say that this model of story
doesn't turn heads in a good way even to

113
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.839
this day 2010's black swan also more or
less followed the story of a young

114
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:51.760
performer latching onto the success of
an established star to catapult her own

115
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.839
career so it's not like the plot itself
is tainted but it does take a very

116
00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:00.399
steady hand to keep the format from
descending into a catfight and all about

117
00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:04.800
eve is definitely not the only diva
fight story out there especially if you

118
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.040
want to swap actress for goddess there
are any number of greek plays and myths

119
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.959
about goddesses destroying lives over
petty disagreements and are actresses

120
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:16.080
not
modern day goddesses worshipped at the

121
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.240
altar of the tabloid rack the gay appeal
of all about eve is likely a combination

122
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.480
of a few things primarily the script
written by joseph bankowitz who wrote

123
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.839
enough shade into the film to put oscar
wilde to shame come to think of it the

124
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.399
film does share a number of very wildean
elements on top of characters who spar

125
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.560
with wit there's a discourse on age and
aging that leans toward an almost

126
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.320
vilification of youth and those who
venerate youth but the film would be

127
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.040
nothing without george saunders anne
baxter and of course betty davis to

128
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.440
carry the film's demand for sharp minds
davis herself had a very substantial gay

129
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.760
following a staunch ally in her private
life and at times even an outspoken one

130
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.360
referring to gays as her friends when
confronting president ronald reagan

131
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.680
about his administration's inaction
during the aids crisis davis herself

132
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.079
was in no small part responsible for
helping screen acting depart from its

133
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:10.240
origins of theatrical acting whereas in
the theater an actor would project their

134
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.720
acting to the back of the room actions
were grand and bold and lions were

135
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.600
delivered clearly and methodically davis
was more natural and for this reason

136
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.279
whenever davis was in a film it was like
she was acting in an entirely different

137
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.279
movie from everyone else she was one of
the first actors to really dive into

138
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:31.360
presenting a character with the kind of
naturalism you couldn't really project

139
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.600
on stage
which nothing exemplifies this more than

140
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.079
acting opposite joan crawford in 1962's
whatever happened to baby jane probably

141
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:46.920
one of the most foundational films
of modern gay culture

142
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:55.120
[Music]
parodies of this have been done over and

143
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.440
over again to the point where you hear
the name and you hear the premise and

144
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.920
you likely think it's this exploitation
comedic camp romp that may compare to a

145
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.440
telenovela you'd be partially right
because it did kick off the hag

146
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.959
exploitation trend that carried crawford
through her late career in hollywood

147
00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:14.160
high exploitation was a particular
subset of horror that was built on

148
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.480
hollywood's disdain for older women
where women of a certain age are

149
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.200
portrayed as horrifying monsters simply
because of their birthday but this genre

150
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.600
in subversive fashion accidentally gave
these women some of the best roles of

151
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.760
their later careers but as the
progenitor of high exploitation whatever

152
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.560
happened to baby jane is so much more
than the genre it created it tells the

153
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.680
story of baby jane hudson played again
by betty davis and blanche hudson played

154
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.920
by the infamous joan crawford more on
her later formerly famous sisters living

155
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.760
in their twilight years the film has two
sequences which we can see as prologues

156
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.360
in the first we see baby jane at the
center of a stage performing a song and

157
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.120
dance show for a riveted crowd her
father her manager and songwriter

158
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.760
prefers to redirect attention from jane
to himself as indicated later on in the

159
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.079
film where we see that all of the songs
he wrote for jane were about her daddy

160
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:11.279
off stage blanche longs for her moment
in the spotlight in the second prologue

161
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.959
the women are both making their way
through hollywood a producer remarks

162
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:20.320
that jane hudson can't act to save her
life but they're stuck casting her see

163
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.399
blanche is their golden starlet a
talented actress who can sell tickets

164
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:28.720
like none other and she's got it in her
contract that for every film she does

165
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.200
the studio must also cast jane in
another we then see a nighttime scene

166
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.079
where presumably one of the hudson girls
tries to murder the other by crushing

167
00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:43.360
her between a car and the driveway gate
the audience is led to believe that it

168
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.839
was a resentful jane who drove into
blanche and left her paraplegic and

169
00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:51.200
bedridden for the rest of her life the
film itself follows the progression of

170
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.160
these sisters in their later life
blanche's old films have gone on to

171
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.320
television and jane is none too pleased
with her particular lot in life taking

172
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.399
care of her sister hand and foot every
time blanche hits a blood-curdling

173
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:09.200
buzzer
[Music]

174
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.160
the plot revolves around jane learning
that blanche is trying to sell their

175
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.440
house with no clear indication of what
jane will do when presumably left

176
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.920
homeless as a severely alcoholic 60 year
old she plans to take up her old act

177
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.920
again and tour with her old songs for
income of her own and independence from

178
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.480
blanche it goes about as well as you
would assume as blanche gets closer and

179
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.519
closer to selling the house jane begins
to spiral deeper depicted almost as a

180
00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:37.440
slasher serial killer tormenting a
wheelchair-bound sister who can do

181
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.199
nothing to escape her situation jane
is terrifying about halfway through the

182
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:47.440
film jane's portrayal begins to shift
jane continuously expects people to know

183
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.839
who she is and is a little put off when
people don't recognize her

184
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:56.480
maybe you remember me
and baby jane

185
00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:02.160
sure at first this feeds into her
portrayal as a monster this arrogant

186
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.639
fame obsessed petty woman who lords her
control over blanche is the only thing

187
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:11.279
that makes her feel powerful we see jane
and we think that she's out of her mind

188
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:15.199
that she's entirely convinced that it's
possible to relive her girlhood but as

189
00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:18.720
the film goes on
we get the feeling that she

190
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.160
is
legitimately out of her mind and what we

191
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.560
saw as arrogance is now depicted as a
delusional mental state she does not

192
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.519
want to merely rekindle her youth
she seems entirely unaware that it even

193
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:34.320
ended
having spent the entire film with her

194
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.519
ghoulish white face and heart-shaped
beauty mark

195
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:41.040
we see it later on
smudged

196
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.959
we the audience finally see that this
was not a directorial decision but a

197
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:49.040
component of jane's character every
morning she has been putting on this

198
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.959
white face of makeup and drawing on a
heart onto her cheek

199
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:57.279
because she is locked in this state of
existence and does not seem able to

200
00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.959
escape this is after all the same makeup
she would have worn

201
00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:05.199
under the bright lights of a stage in
fact she begins to regress

202
00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:10.000
acting younger and younger
but there's one problem that just won't

203
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.560
let her be young

204
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:19.120
oh shut up
just like jane there's a flip for

205
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.480
blanche too
early on we see jane's accusations that

206
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.480
blanche is out to stop jane from living
her life and we agree with blanche's

207
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.320
denial of that because jane seems to be
the villain

208
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.639
and blanche by contrast is sweet and
patient with everyone she interacts with

209
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:39.440
but more and more we see blanche
extending what control she has over jane

210
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.399
the house after all is in her name
she controls the money she controls

211
00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:49.519
jane's drinking and in a very nonchalant
way does like to remind jane of that and

212
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:53.680
blanche does in her own way begin to
admit that maybe jane's feelings of

213
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.600
isolation at blanche's insistence aren't
completely unfounded what seems like a

214
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.959
woman afraid for her life and pleading
with her captor

215
00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:07.279
can alternately be seen as a woman who's
pulling out all the stops to placate

216
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:12.160
someone she's been manipulating for
years see as jane descends further and

217
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.839
further into a childlike delusion
she begins to lose sight of the

218
00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:19.440
consequences of her actions as she
torments blanche

219
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.440
blanche begins to remind jane of her
dependence

220
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.560
and her attempts to escape become bolder
jane responds in kind detaining her

221
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.639
ripping the buzzer from the wall firing
blanche's maid tying blanche to her bed

222
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:36.399
for days on end with no food and then
murdering the kind maid

223
00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:40.720
when she finds blanche tied up when jane
is found out by the pianist she hired

224
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.519
for her planned upcoming career
resurgence

225
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:48.240
jane is thrown into a full meltdown for
reasons unknown

226
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.160
she goes to blanche and desperately
pulls her into the car to go to the

227
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.240
beach jane had reminisced about the
beach that she fondly remembers

228
00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.560
rehearsing there where people would
circle around to watch her dancing jane

229
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.120
has a wonderful day running around
barefoot playing catch with other

230
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.400
children
and joyfully getting ice cream for her

231
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.679
and her sister while forgetting to pay
all the while

232
00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:15.280
dehydrated malnourished and immobile
blanche

233
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.799
cooks
in the sun blanche does not have much

234
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:24.000
time left and urges jane to hear a final
confession jane childishly holds her

235
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
hands to her ears refusing to hear what
blanche has to say

236
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.760
what she knows is true
and what she had to reject for the last

237
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.880
30 years to survive that it was blanche
behind the wheel of the car that night

238
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.120
and that before the car hit jane she
drunkenly stumbled out of the way

239
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.720
the accident left blanche crippled
and she crawled out from behind the

240
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.720
wheel to make it seem like it was jane
who had tried to kill her and then we

241
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.799
see the film in a different light
this was not about a jealous sister who

242
00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:57.360
resented the others fame and success to
the point of committing torture this was

243
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.200
about a woman who had been gaslit so
severely

244
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.320
that her entire psyche had collapsed
jane was robbed of her childhood by her

245
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.240
father and robbed of her womanhood by
her sister all the while everyone told

246
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.720
her that she was the monster behind
everything and so she turned herself

247
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.919
into that monster retroactively
we learned that jane's feelings and

248
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:24.320
paranoias were valid all along and that
blanche never really quit acting after

249
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.360
all
acting the part of the victim blanche

250
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.960
had spent 30 years exploiting a
fabricated guilt complex to make a loyal

251
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.600
servant out of jane and as soon as she
had a more pliable willing servant

252
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.200
she was all too ready to completely
discard her sister

253
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.679
jane though a monster nevertheless was a
monster that blanche had created not

254
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:47.919
entirely unlike us queer folk who are
gaslit into believing we're the broken

255
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:52.720
ones in a society too broken to accept
us whose parents abandon us

256
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.679
leaving us feeling unloved and unknown
but on the california beach where jane

257
00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.640
sits beside blanche
and remarks

258
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.679
to her abuser

259
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.880
all this time we could have been friends
and then the audience is left with this

260
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.400
visceral discomfort for the next few
hours now

261
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.320
like with all about eve it's clear to
see why it would appeal to fem heavy

262
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.480
queer circles it's got all the kind of
meaty feminine things the drag queens

263
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.919
love outrageous personalities women
using duplicity as a weapon old icons

264
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:34.480
clinging on to past glory pathos in
excess which isn't a half bad definition

265
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.120
of camp actually pathos in excess
finding gravitas in the mundane making

266
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.960
an aristocracy out of the destitute
isolating this house from the rest of

267
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.840
the world
all the politics of culture art and

268
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.679
society matter less than the ability to
navigate the politics of this enclosure

269
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:53.840
because the fact of the matter is that
both of these women are suffering due to

270
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.760
their father despite having a relatively
small role in the film itself

271
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.760
he left both girls with emotional scars
that would heavily influence their

272
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.440
downfall because while he did manage
jane's career and her youth he also

273
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.640
facilitated blanche's career in
hollywood and while he bought the house

274
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.240
the girls live in there is some question
as to whether he bought it with the

275
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.200
money he made off of jane
or off a blanch make no mistake he did

276
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.520
make the money off of his girls and
something that is true to queer circles

277
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.039
it is so tempting to climb to the top of
the heap

278
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:28.559
at the bottom of the barrel
even if it means stepping on other

279
00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:33.679
people below you to do it but aside from
plot and themes the film's primary draw

280
00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:37.760
was being able to finally watch joan
crawford and betty davis act against

281
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.919
each other fans flocked to it like it
was the boxing match of the century the

282
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:45.760
drama around this film hovered like a
miasma when in reality the rivalry

283
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.919
between crawford and davis was played up
even at the time before baby jane their

284
00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:55.200
feud amounted to basically fighting for
the same roles for the past 10 years

285
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.280
that was it and when it comes to the
making of drama yes there was a lot in

286
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.640
fact as per the camp definition of
making much ado about nothing the

287
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.640
behind-the-scenes antics rivaled what
you'd watch in a movie ranging from all

288
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.120
manner of petty things the women did to
piss each other off the studio seeing

289
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.000
the dailies come in seemed to encourage
this animosity among their actresses

290
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.280
producers were worried that if crawford
and davis buried the hatchet during

291
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.840
filming that their characters loathing
of each other wouldn't be as palpable

292
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.600
so like in the film
two women were pitted against each other

293
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.200
by men
so that men could profit off of them but

294
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.039
to me the most interesting thing about
the making of the film is that

295
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:39.360
yes joan crawford really did pitch this
idea to warner brothers and essentially

296
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.960
single-handedly pulled this project
together maybe foolishly she didn't go

297
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.400
after a producer credit and honestly if
this was the kind of quality she could

298
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.760
assemble
she could have been a trailblazer for

299
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.799
women on the production end of hollywood
instead

300
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:56.080
crawford was obsessed with being a movie
star

301
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.919
specifically she wanted another oscar or
at least a nomination and she really

302
00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:03.200
thought that she could act the straight
character opposite the woman losing her

303
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.760
mind and get an oscar nomination for
being in a wheelchair for half the movie

304
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.039
she really thought
that that was going to be enough and no

305
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:15.360
disrespect she did have an oscar by then
however as a typified movie star joan

306
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.960
crawford really only ever played joan
crawford in whatever movie she was in

307
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.039
that's what movie stars are for
they're cast because their personal

308
00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:27.520
brand will fit in a given movie and
that's not to say that movie stars

309
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.000
aren't as good or valuable as character
actors would you rather be julia roberts

310
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.880
or tilda swinton it's not a contest it's
just a different game that said davis

311
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.440
did have a habit of elevating actors she
was in the same room as in instances

312
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.880
like all about eve you can see the cast
beginning to adopt more of davis's

313
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.200
signature style as the film goes on and
become much more natural perhaps to the

314
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.840
benefit of whatever happened to baby
jane joan crawford wasn't a good enough

315
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.360
actress to act through her natural
narcissism crawford making sure that she

316
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.039
was picture perfect for each shot that
the camera caught all her good angles

317
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:05.760
her emphasis on beauty in spite of being
a shut-in who hadn't seen the sun for 20

318
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.720
years
all of that added an extra layer of

319
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.280
fraudulence to the character jones
natural demeanor bled through and added

320
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.400
to blanche's fraudulent duplicity this
is the value of a movie star

321
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.960
without intending to and perhaps without
realizing it joan elevated an otherwise

322
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.760
benign role and it's because of all
these nuances and subtleties that hag

323
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.720
exploitation became such a hit genre in
the 60s there was a clamor to cash in on

324
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.799
the trope whatever happened to baby jane
with a budget of just under 1 million

325
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:40.720
dollars grossed 10 million dollars at
the box office which even by today's

326
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.720
standards would be considered an indie
success but in the 1960s

327
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.679
this was a cash cow however as a
progenitor it employed a massive amount

328
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:53.919
of talent in front of and behind the
camera filmmakers who wanted to innovate

329
00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:57.360
to bring out the thematic elements of
the story it's often the curse of

330
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.240
repetition that people will say i want
to do that thing without realizing what

331
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.200
it was that made that thing so impactful
there's a reason halloween spearheaded

332
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.799
the slasher movie and was never
superseded by the man with a knife

333
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:16.080
copycats had exploitation was
constructed around old women being shady

334
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.960
and even crazy though whatever happened
to baby jane was a character study on

335
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.679
the cognitive dissonance of long-term
gaslighting the complex relationships of

336
00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:30.080
sisters and constructing a narrative
where truth and illusion are difficult

337
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.480
to discern it all takes a very steady
hand to pull that off without dipping

338
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.720
into farce because you can get all the
cheap thrills you need just by having

339
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.360
women being naughty there does need to
be that element of pathos to really give

340
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.559
something legs though because it is in
the pathos that we the audience can see

341
00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:52.559
ourselves reflected in while there are
few of us who are blanche and or jane

342
00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:55.039
hudson's
we can see the elements of their

343
00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:59.200
relationship and apply it to our own
lives and that's what happened to baby

344
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.799
jane of course it seems to be a pattern
that we're inherently drawn to films

345
00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:06.000
which depict established icons serving
up something new

346
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.880
old dogs learning new tricks only adds
to their legend and from here

347
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.520
we turn from betty davis and joan
crawford and look toward another gay

348
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.320
icon
elizabeth taylor

349
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:32.320
i'm sure you've heard of her what a dump
[Music]

350
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.760
the same year that whatever happened to
baby jane premiered the world of theater

351
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.200
was shooketh by the premiere of who's
afraid of virginia woolf

352
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.520
which went on to win tony's for best
play and in the acting categories he was

353
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.520
also selected to win a pulitzer prize
though the committee struck down that

354
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.559
decision as the play had
too much profanity the same year who's

355
00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:55.039
afraid of virginia woolf was first
staged

356
00:25:55.039 --> 00:26:00.080
the film cleopatra also hit theaters
another entry in elizabeth taylor's ubra

357
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.559
though unfortunately
cleopatra was a disaster we remember it

358
00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:09.120
now as this kind of
iconic symbol of hollywood opulence

359
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.400
taylor's personal wardrobe budget was
nearly two hundred thousand dollars in

360
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.120
1960. that's about two million dollars
today taylor herself was offered the

361
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.279
part after a very lengthy casting
process and only reluctantly agreed to

362
00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:25.520
do it she highballed the studio for a
contract she thought fox would never go

363
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.960
for and broke a record for being the
first actress to be paid one million

364
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.960
dollars for a single hollywood movie
there's conflicting accounts but she may

365
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.279
have been the first actor period to get
a million dollar salary for a movie

366
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.880
alternately it may have been marlon
brando for mutiny on the bounty but you

367
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.200
know
he sucked a dick or two so he's part of

368
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.760
the club the film took nearly 10 years
to finish and was initially pitched as a

369
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.919
modest 2 million historical fiction
however production was launched during

370
00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:57.120
the peak of hollywood spectacle so the
studio's take on it was that this was a

371
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.760
fabulous time to go big or go home that
two million dollars quickly got inflated

372
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.880
to 31 million dollars anyway artistic
sensibilities shifted in the 1960s

373
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.039
audiences turned away from raw spectacle
and instead preferred more personal

374
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:14.400
stories
like the graduate easy rider bonnie and

375
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.880
clyde and whatever happened to baby jane
cleopatra's budget was so inflated and

376
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.600
audiences were so disinterested in
spectacle that it nearly tanked 20th

377
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.559
century fox they were only saved by the
rocky horror picture show

378
00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:32.320
more camp look it up it's true and
getting to the point the movie was at

379
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.480
the time said to be the end of elizabeth
taylor's career fast forward to a few

380
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.600
short years later when a screen
adaptation of who's afraid of virginia

381
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.399
woolf was announced and taylor was due
to play the lead critics immediately

382
00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:48.240
scoffed they felt the taylor's movie
star brand clashed with the content of

383
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.320
the play and the tailor herself was too
young to convincingly play a middle-aged

384
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.840
woman but no
taylor really did get on set and eat

385
00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.480
that chicken wing on camera she
relentlessly committed to martha it was

386
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.279
uncanny it's worth noting that actors
even in films today do not normally eat

387
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.880
on camera there's usually a cut before
or after giving an actor a chance to

388
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.159
spit out what's in their mouth or
pretend to chew while holding a sandwich

389
00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:16.000
with a bite taken out of it a problem
you know arises if you need to do 10

390
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.480
takes of an actor eating pizza what
happened to you do i look fat liz i had

391
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.320
to eat four slices of pizza on stage at
each performance jenna that's 32 pieces

392
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:29.039
of pizza a week no that can't be right
the story follows george and martha

393
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:32.559
which you may hear a gay describe a
given couple as a regular george and

394
00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:36.960
martha not a flattering remark george is
an associate professor and despite his

395
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.360
clear intellect and how long he's taught
at the university and the fact that

396
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.159
martha is the daughter of the university
president he is locked in this lowly

397
00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:50.960
position for reasons not yet known
upon returning home from a faculty

398
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.799
function late at night martha tells
george tired and half drunk that she's

399
00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:57.360
invited a young couple over to have a
drink

400
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.720
george
reluctantly agrees even before the

401
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.960
couple arrives george and martha do
nothing but needle each other to the

402
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.840
point of verbal emotional and physical
abuse it's not particularly clear who is

403
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.279
abusing who
though it does seem that martha is the

404
00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:16.880
instigator when the couple arrives nick
a young professor of biology and his

405
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.799
wife honey george and martha don't stop
needling each other but they begin to be

406
00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:25.520
more subtle about it they verbally
express their enjoyment of playing games

407
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.840
but it's not clear what those games are
as george and martha load up the guests

408
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.000
with drinks
their polite masks begin to crack with a

409
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.840
full argument breaking out when martha
mentions their 16 year old son tahani

410
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:44.000
again for reasons unknown
nick admits to george that he intends to

411
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.279
sleep his way up the university ladder
saying that he wouldn't mind starting

412
00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:51.840
with martha to george's face which
george just kind of takes in stride

413
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.120
which somehow makes this scene even more
homoerotic than it already was as the

414
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.559
group gets drunker and looser nick gets
flirtier with everybody but his wife as

415
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:06.159
part of their game martha reveals that
the reason george can't get a promotion

416
00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:09.279
is because he admitted to the university
president that he spent years in a

417
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:12.640
mental institution for accidentally
killing his parents and that he would

418
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.760
have been blacklisted from all of
academia if it wasn't for martha's

419
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.840
insistence for which
george attacks her after a fatalistic

420
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.080
argument with george martha takes nick
and they have wild drunken sex for which

421
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.640
it's implied that nick actually had a
tough time keeping it up

422
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.159
once again leading to some speculation
about who nick had actually intended to

423
00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:36.799
sleep with to climb that ladder and as a
coup de grace in the game george

424
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:40.960
kills his and martha's own child twitch
the audience and the house guests are

425
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960
confused
see

426
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.000
what happened is that the child never
existed

427
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.320
george and martha could not conceive for
unclear reasons and george permitted

428
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.720
martha to make a fantasy child however
due to george's shaky reputation a rule

429
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.960
of this game was that nobody could ever
know about this imaginary child a rule

430
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.039
martha broke when in her drunken
enthusiasm she told honey about him

431
00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:07.519
thereby giving george permission as per
the rules of the game to kill him in a

432
00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.880
car accident
straight people and people think wanda

433
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.480
has a weird situation with her kids the
young couple heads home now realizing

434
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.679
what a tangled mess they've gotten
themselves into by choosing an exciting

435
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:21.200
career in academia a field where people
have too much intellectual energy

436
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.480
without enough to actually do
and george and martha resolve to stay

437
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.320
together because they don't have
anything else but each other but

438
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.080
like all about eve and whatever happened
to baby jane there is more to this than

439
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.919
betty davis joan crawford and elizabeth
taylor dragging their gay fans into

440
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:39.519
movie seats to watch this film at
gunpoint about damaged heterosexuals on

441
00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:43.279
top of the fact that this is two hours
of shade and a fabulous older woman

442
00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:47.919
getting a studly young man in the sack
there's some back brain gay appeal here

443
00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:52.399
who's afraid of virginia woolf primarily
takes on a critique of social values

444
00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:57.440
namely the performativity of social
expectations both george and martha are

445
00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.360
so disillusioned with their lives that
they prefer to develop actual illusions

446
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.480
to exist in
to the extent where they themselves are

447
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.000
unaware
of where the lines are drawn there's

448
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.120
also a whole lot to say about who may
hold the real power in this relationship

449
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.880
to the outside it's a wonder why they
even chose to be together nick certainly

450
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.880
doesn't seem to understand it at first
and questions why martha even chooses to

451
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.039
keep protecting george's career with
that bargaining chip it would seem she

452
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:29.600
carries the ultimatum to him
she clearly hates george and would do

453
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.360
fine with another man but that's where
he's wrong george

454
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.559
who is out somewhere there in the dark
who is good to me

455
00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:44.000
whom i revile
who can keep learning the games we play

456
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.960
as quickly as i can change them
who can make me happy and i do not wish

457
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.679
to be happy martha may serve as a
protection for george's career but

458
00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:57.840
george as someone who understands the
need to escape a traumatic reality may

459
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.399
be the only person who would allow
martha's illusions to flourish

460
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:06.960
they have this
tumultuous codependency that they both

461
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.480
hate and yet that they both need to
function

462
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.399
power dynamics for them are like a game
of hungry hungry hippos with infinite

463
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:18.799
marbles they're both in it to win it
even if winning's impossible even if the

464
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:23.120
trophy is a few seconds of emotional
superiority it's worth getting dragged

465
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.480
through the mud and so because their
lives are too mundane for their taste

466
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.559
they develop this mutually accepted
environment of games what their games

467
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:38.000
seem to be as i said are a temporary
emotional victory but also something

468
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.600
deeper
martha is a powerful woman

469
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.440
and given the social climate of the
1960s she may be betting correctly when

470
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.559
she says she won't be able to find
another relationship where she can have

471
00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:52.880
the kind of control that she does but
she also doesn't want some simp that'll

472
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.720
just bend over for her
she wants an equal footing of power and

473
00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.919
a romantic dynamic and we do see her
when she is affectionate with george

474
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:05.519
at least in taylor's performance but
taylor's take on martha is that this is

475
00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:09.200
a woman who
easily becomes bored with a clearly

476
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.359
defined power dynamic she would rather
have her toxic battle with george than

477
00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:16.560
take the risk of looking for something
else that would be more

478
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.800
healthy the gay appeal here is that
whatever happened to virginia woolf

479
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.159
who's afraid of baby jane there's
something about eve baby um gays are

480
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.760
drawn to the eternal struggle of george
and martha because it

481
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.320
typifies a lot of the straight
experiences that we've seen it raises

482
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.839
the question without answering it

483
00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:39.679
are the straights okay because we see
them in these relationships these

484
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:44.159
marriages these arrangements we see them
fight and scuffle and rush into things

485
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.599
and we see them go through it all
because

486
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:52.720
i mean it's not really clear if you hate
doing something

487
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.480
why do you do it we see this weird
muscle memory that straight people have

488
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.200
around milestones what your life should
look like by a certain age what age you

489
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.960
have to be to get married to buy your
first house to have kids there's no

490
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.200
clear rule book that says this and yet
to this day there are psychological

491
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.000
expectations which depending upon region
have specific dates and the straights

492
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.400
all know them it's like gays knowing the
lyrics to lady gaga shaiza nobody asked

493
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.119
them nobody said they had to know these
things and yet somehow they all do yet

494
00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:27.760
we tell ourselves
that we are free george and martha

495
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.000
represent what we fear the heterosexual
urge to twist your own arm to be able to

496
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.920
fit a nuclear family ideal
to make concessions of yourself and your

497
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.200
own identity for the sake of fitting
this appearance

498
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.599
and meanwhile
telling everyone around you

499
00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:48.240
that this is just how it's meant to be
inventing toxic games to torment your

500
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.119
spouse constantly pushing boundaries
redefining what the boundaries are and

501
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:57.680
making up fake rules as red herrings all
to fill that intellectual need to feel

502
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.480
powerful and you take it out on your
spouse because

503
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.760
what are they going to do
break the codependency completely

504
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.079
destroy the both of you marriage offers
no recourse your bank accounts are

505
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:12.800
together
you're afraid of changing

506
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.960
because you built your life
around this other person you're stuck

507
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.160
that's where you live that's where you
exist there's way too much emotional

508
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.640
baggage wrapped up in the other to just
leave

509
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.480
so why not flex the power you can and
see what broken boundary is just too far

510
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.280
what is divorce if not the safe word for
suburban families when it comes to

511
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.960
george and martha there's no way to win
the game

512
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.640
but if playing the game is pushing the
other one to their limit and either

513
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.480
forcing them to redefine their limit or
give up then giving up

514
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.640
is losing and like the previous films
discussed it's very clear to see how a

515
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.720
story like this could translate into an
almost slapstick first as i said about

516
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.720
steady hands there was an incredible
amount of talent in this production and

517
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.800
there is a reason why
out of the library of gay camp which is

518
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.119
held up on a pedestal
these older entries approach their

519
00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:10.560
subject matter with much more
seriousness than you would get out of a

520
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.400
john waters movie though this list is
not comprehensive these belong to a

521
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.960
group of progenitors
which present these themes as realities

522
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.880
when these movies do well and resonate
with audiences there are going to be a

523
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.119
horde of people who want to recreate
these themes and emotions and many of

524
00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:31.680
these imitation films were forgotten
many simply couldn't go as hard they

525
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.640
were unremarkable or interchangeable and
thus forgettable but some took the

526
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.320
nuance and decided that if they couldn't
match elizabeth taylor then they would

527
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.280
exceed her and thus
the gays redefined what has now become

528
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.760
known as camp
and camp

529
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.320
in turn

530
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.200
redefined us

531
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.619
[Music]

532
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:05.920
now we're getting into it susan sontag
in her essay notes on camp often cited

533
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.760
as the quintessential document on camp
culture remarks an association between

534
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.160
gays and camp and as she was writing in
the 1960s she was highlighting a very

535
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.480
retroactive depiction from her
upbringing baby jane had only just come

536
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.079
out when this paper was published this
indicates that gay attraction to

537
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:26.720
overwrought and badly depicted feminine
archetypes was well solidified long

538
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.800
before 1981
when the infamous mommy dearest

539
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.680
premiered the purported true story of
growing up with movie star joan crawford

540
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.240
as a mother through the process of
imitation baby jane cleopatra martha eve

541
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.240
harrington and crawford herself are
imitated here to the point where in faye

542
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.280
dunaway's mind playing joan crawford
this is a perfectly nuanced depiction of

543
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.440
hollywood's archetypal movie star john
waters described mommy dearest as the

544
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.400
first drag queen role played by a woman
and he's not wrong but it seems to be

545
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.480
completely by accident films that are
accidental camp are kind of rare without

546
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.079
clear intent failed camp either goes so
big that it looks cheap and we

547
00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:10.480
disconnect or they don't go big enough
either way we don't make a point of

548
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.280
remembering those movies so when one
does manage to hit the right buttons

549
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.640
we hold onto it for dear life so enter
mommy dearest first published as a book

550
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.359
by christina crawford in 1978 describing
her torturous relationship with her

551
00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:30.560
mother joan one year after jones death
in 1977 the story is about a daughter

552
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.079
who is struggling to reconcile her love
for an abusive parent which

553
00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:39.920
would have made a great movie in no time
at all studios snatched up the rights to

554
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.599
the story and christina herself wrote a
script when faye dunaway was cast in the

555
00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:48.160
lead role riding on her oscar from
1977's network the studio and faye

556
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.720
herself wanted to restructure the script
to center around crawford with faye's

557
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.560
husband who she managed to make a
producer on the film trying to sanitize

558
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.160
joan and christina's husband being
accused of trying to turn joan into a

559
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.040
monster so
what joan did we get the film opens with

560
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.280
dunaway's crawford hollywood queen
musing about how despite her success in

561
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.079
global allure she feels like there's
just

562
00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:17.440
something missing from her life yes her
career is in a bit of a slump but she

563
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.119
isn't as concerned about that because
she thinks that just means that

564
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:26.319
now is a great time to become a mother
unable to bear children she begins to

565
00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:30.319
suggest the option of adoption to her
then boyfriend and hollywood lawyer greg

566
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:33.599
savitt who helps her pull the strings
she needs to pull to have an adoption

567
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:39.520
agency hand her a baby this scene is
played entirely straight by the way this

568
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.520
visual pulls crawford to the center of
attention like a reifenstahl-esque

569
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.000
monarch or idol once again
unnecessary pathos and all this

570
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.920
unnecessary pathos feeds into this lofty
visual language of jones perfection

571
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.319
channeled through dunaway we're only
five minutes in and no it does not slow

572
00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:02.160
down from here the first act of the film
explores the strange power dynamic

573
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.160
between joan and her young daughter
christina this is where most of the

574
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.520
iconic scenes of the movie come from
because this is where joan is depicted

575
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.200
at her most unhinged now how can one of
the most powerful actresses in

576
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.960
hollywood's history have a struggle for
power

577
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.680
with a child
well that's something that critics slam

578
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.560
the script for there isn't really any
textual reason for why joan is such a

579
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.720
terror to her family there's no reason
why joan is triggered at the sight of a

580
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.720
wire hanger or why christopher has to
wear a harness to bed which feeds into

581
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.319
the insanity of this role there are all
of these compulsions but no exploration

582
00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:44.240
as to why the surface level of the
analysis is

583
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.920
out to seemingly use joan to subvert the
expectations of a hollywood star someone

584
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.319
for whom the public lawed as the ideal
of perfection and womanhood though in

585
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:57.520
reality
is a monster in her private life

586
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.319
when cameras are on she's joan crawford
when they're off she's a woman who is

587
00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:07.119
desperately trying to keep everyone in
line so that she can be joan crawford

588
00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:11.680
already the gays are on board for that
we love expose on fakeness feels like

589
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.319
gossip with substance guilt-free
relating to our personal lives a lot of

590
00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:20.319
queer people in the community come from
families that an outsider would say are

591
00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:24.240
ideal but for those of us who have to
live with our parents homophobic

592
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.319
attitudes that perfection is a little
different behind closed doors parents

593
00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:34.720
often let nasty things slip when they're
away from polite company and that's

594
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.880
doubly complicated because it means
nobody believes you especially nowadays

595
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.520
when bigotry isn't quite so in vogue
parents still do and say homophobic and

596
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.720
transphobic [ __ ] but they do get a
little gas lady about it dare i say

597
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.640
shady i've even heard of situations
especially from trans people where their

598
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.960
own therapists will try convincing them
that they're making up their parents

599
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.200
transphobia however just because there's
no surface reading doesn't mean that

600
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.680
explanations aren't inferred which is
mostly on faye dunaway for sucking up

601
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.119
every drop of attention away from any
deeper analysis look a little deeper

602
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.560
into joan's parenting in christina's
early life and especially joan's

603
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.680
biographical context and you guessed it
there's a commentary about youth

604
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.000
and beauty in multiple instances in
mommy dearest whenever it seems that

605
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.200
christina is coming of age as a lady
jones sees that as competition from

606
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.880
living out a fantasy and the spotlight
to taking a few tricks from joan's own

607
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.720
book on how to flirt with men christina
is a threat

608
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.640
to jones reign christina is both a rival
a symbol of her fading youth a child a

609
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.040
miniature version of joan within whom
she can place all her expectations

610
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.079
and an opportunity to exercise her
authority christina must be better than

611
00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:54.720
joan but also joan must use christina to
prove that she's still at the top of her

612
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.040
game she both pushes christina beyond
what is reasonable to expect of a little

613
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.079
girl and also smugly revels in
christina's failures often resorting to

614
00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:08.319
humiliating christina as a punishment
for either not being perfect or for

615
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:12.880
seemingly encroaching on jones reign
what are you doing

616
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.720
don't you tell me what i'm doing don't
tell me

617
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.400
mommy
yeah i know you look awful

618
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.480
you'll be quiet you're always rummaging
through my drawers trying to find a way

619
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.839
to make people look at you while you're
always looking at yourself in the mirror

620
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:32.720
why are you doing that tell me joan is
so fixated on perfection that she can't

621
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.480
handle it when things don't quite fall
into place following several poor

622
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.960
performing films mgm releases joan from
her contract this compiles with a string

623
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.040
of failed romances and triggers a
cascade of joan's greatest fears her

624
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.880
beauty something she felt was her
primary asset

625
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:54.800
is fading but what terrifies her is that
she does not have the talent to make up

626
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.359
for it in her defense yes mgm was
shafting her as a human being she was

627
00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:04.319
aging but they continued to caster her
roles as if she was the joan crawford

628
00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:08.880
that she was 15 years prior instead of
i don't know letting her play more

629
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.680
mature roles they just cut her loose
because she wasn't ageless joan crawford

630
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.119
it is implied held herself up to
perfection

631
00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:19.760
because she
accurately

632
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.040
assumed that a single slip up
would have her thrown to the dogs and

633
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.359
when that fear was validated we can
expect some erratic behavior which gives

634
00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:33.839
us one of the most iconic scenes in camp
history

635
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.560
so hollywood is an absurd place it's why
movies about hollywood generally don't

636
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.000
click with general audiences because
it's a place like no other so you're

637
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.079
already in absurd territory but instead
of mitigating the absurdity and

638
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:50.480
explaining the kind of anxieties and
pressure that exist in this place

639
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.359
there's joan
down on the ground

640
00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:58.560
hacking away at roses in a
gorgeous beaded gown and that line

641
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.839
delivery tina

642
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.000
bring me the axe where each word is
punctuated with an entirely distinct and

643
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.480
separate emotion it's a complete sensory
overload and honestly

644
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.359
though the quote gets thrown around fans
of the scene are missing two of the best

645
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:25.520
parts first the fact that they actually
committed to a wide shot of fey hacking

646
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.839
away at that orange tree in that gown

647
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.040
second joan says bring me the axe the
axe

648
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.800
the
axe

649
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.359
not bring me an axe bring me the axe in
the literal syntactic text of the movie

650
00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:48.000
we can gauge that this is a regular
occurrence at the crawford household

651
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.599
because christina
didn't flinch

652
00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:57.319
and she knew exactly which axe to get
and where to get it

653
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.839
i feel as if the movie had done even the
slightest amount of work to bring out

654
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:07.119
the aforementioned subtext you could
pull off this exact scene as a harrowing

655
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:11.440
self-destruction of joan's psyche
reading into it joan feels her perfect

656
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.079
garden must match her internalized
feeling of inadequacy if mgm tells her

657
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:19.680
that she's not perfect
then there's no point in having anything

658
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.520
perfect around why should something be
more perfect than her if being perfect

659
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.319
was her only value it could be a really
gripping scene the problem is that

660
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:32.480
without adequate build up or actual
exploration of joan's emotions

661
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.800
instead with dunaway opting to depict
these emotions as mood swings this scene

662
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.960
comes out of nowhere it's also worth
mentioning that this film doesn't really

663
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.960
follow a narrative we go from jones
celebrating her long-awaited oscar win

664
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.160
and the winner is
john crawford

665
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.319
directly into
no

666
00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:54.880
wire hi guys ever
which again

667
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.480
could be a legitimately terrifying scene
if there was any kind of narrative

668
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.800
consequentialism that said when it comes
to abusive households there's usually

669
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.280
this soft reset button at the end of the
episode where there's an unspoken

670
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.880
agreement to leave it in the past at
least when it involves younger children

671
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.280
which in and of itself
is a really eerie and unsettling concept

672
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.400
though mommy dearest does absolutely
nothing to establish this precedence

673
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.160
with spoken or visual language and no
the abuse does not end with jones

674
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.839
shipping christina off to boarding
school which it is implied joan was

675
00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:29.520
doing because she observed her daughter
beginning to experiment with flirting

676
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.000
not on her watch when christina is
caught kissing a boy at the school she's

677
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.920
reprimanded by the administration but
joan insists that she be expelled for

678
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.000
some reason and instead pulls christina
out of the school now as it turned out

679
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.920
beyond just kissing boys christina ended
up quite enjoying her time away from her

680
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.119
mother at the boarding school
and given that the discipline obsessed

681
00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:52.559
joan originally intended private school
to be a punishment

682
00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:56.400
enjoying a punishment
is also something that will not happen

683
00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.599
on her watch leading to
another iconic scene joan

684
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:04.720
barba please
please barbara

685
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.040
bringing christina home as she has an
interview schedule joan coyly if not

686
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.119
proudly remarks that christina was
expelled after telling christina not to

687
00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:17.520
talk about the expulsion i can't think
of a single parent who would gloat about

688
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.160
their child's expulsion
but to joan it's almost like a victory a

689
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.839
failure for a rival is a victory for her
christina points out to the reporter

690
00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:32.079
that she was not in fact expelled twitch
joan throws a fit over being accused of

691
00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:35.920
lying even though
she was lying why do you deliberately

692
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:41.119
defy me why did you tell her i got
expelled because you did get expelled

693
00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:45.200
that
is a lie

694
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.520
when christina calls her out joan just
goes right on and slaps her in front of

695
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.599
the reporter and then blames her for
making her embarrass herself in front of

696
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:58.960
the reporter you
you deliberately embarrass me in front

697
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.319
of a reporter
joan begins to spiral aimlessly with

698
00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:07.920
such and such parental insults about
gratitude but it seems like christina's

699
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.000
done with this song and dance and asks
why joan bothered to adopt her if joan

700
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.400
didn't seem to want anything to do with
christina why did you adopt me

701
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.520
maybe i did it for a little extra
publicity

702
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.200
tensions rise and
why can't you treat me

703
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.400
i would be treated by any stranger on
the street

704
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:39.559
because i am not
one of your fans

705
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.760
and now we're getting into the territory
of christina's accounts that can be

706
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.640
backed up by fact fact number one
is that yes joan really did replace

707
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.839
christina on a soap opera
that christina was cast in joan in her

708
00:50:55.839 --> 00:51:00.319
60s takes the role of a 28 year old
woman while christina is recovering from

709
00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:05.359
a benign ovarian tumor fact number two
is another iconic scene joan crawford

710
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:09.920
was on the board of directors for
pepsico via her husband the company was

711
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.520
a nothing upstart to compete with the
behemoth that was coca-cola joan was

712
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.119
brought on as a brand ambassador and
basically made the company into what it

713
00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:21.520
was joan married the ceo and the board
of directors did try to force her out

714
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.599
after his death in the film this
encounter is depicted with jones

715
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:31.280
screaming into the boardroom famously
saying dude with me fellas and though

716
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.240
this is a famous line from the film it's
not the line that was lifted from the

717
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.640
secretary's notes at the meeting but
joan did say to the directors i fought

718
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.760
worse monsters than you for years in
hollywood i know how to win the hard way

719
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.839
ironically this is one of dunaway's more
understated lines in the entire film

720
00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:51.599
this meeting in reality was much more
cordial than dunaway delivered why did

721
00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:57.440
it need to get turned up to an 11
why not that's why rounding off the film

722
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.800
is the reading of joan crawford's will
with christina and christopher when it

723
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.640
comes to what joan left them joan writes
that they will receive nothing

724
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.880
reasons which are well known
to them

725
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.559
which was the literal reading of the
will

726
00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:19.040
that happened that's the last thing
christopher and christina ever heard

727
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.520
from their mother and when asked
apparently neither of them

728
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.760
know what those reasons were there are
some suggestions that joan wrote them

729
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.319
out of the will because she heard
christina was already writing mommy

730
00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:33.359
dearest while joan was alive but that
doesn't explain why she nicks

731
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.880
christopher the film doesn't even
mention jones younger two children who

732
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.640
she adopted just about the same time
that christina went off to boarding

733
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.760
school funny timing that now as with all
great camp movies half of the fun is the

734
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.559
gossip and the making of mommy dearest
is no exception as mentioned mommy

735
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:55.680
dearest was a celebrity expose
christina's account is a pain-tormented

736
00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.000
struggle between loving her mother and
recalling good memories of joan but also

737
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.559
living through some
very traumatic abuse and behavior though

738
00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:09.119
the way hollywood figures talk about it
especially those who are close to joan

739
00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:13.440
even betty davis herself christina makes
joan out to be a demon

740
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.119
that she wasn't who's one of the worst
people you know in hollywood

741
00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:20.000
that i worked with or that you wouldn't
want to work with again if you don't you

742
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.640
don't have one one million dollars fade
down away but the book is much tamer

743
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.160
especially if your frame of reference is
the movie and honestly a lot of the

744
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.880
vitriol that gets slung at christina is
well i never saw joan beat her children

745
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.960
i never saw this happen well i never saw
harvey weinstein rape anybody which

746
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.800
you'd think in this post me too believe
victim society that excuse wouldn't fly

747
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:47.119
but christina to this day has haters i
think christine was very very envious

748
00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:53.200
of joan crawford and her public and her
popularity and her beauty hollywood is

749
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.640
said to be a small town and the vitriol
directed at christina may simply be them

750
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.400
protecting one of their own christina
does make a point of specifically

751
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.640
blaming hollywood for crafting jones
narcissism before the fall of the studio

752
00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.960
system the studios themselves would mold
their stars into fitting specific

753
00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.920
personality ideals to put on airs not
only for cameras but for fans in private

754
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.079
it was rare that you'd get a star like
davis or katherine hepburn who didn't

755
00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:24.240
bother with the facade this is apparent
in a documentary called bright lights

756
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.720
starring carrie fisher and debbie
reynolds

757
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.040
may they rest in peace reynolds while
being interviewed still had her

758
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.599
signature debbie reynolds charm however
the documentary crew kept the cameras

759
00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:39.440
rolling when carrie took her aside from
around the corner

760
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.720
debbie's voice is much weaker and more
vulnerable

761
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.200
even though she was a woman in her 80s
debbie reynolds was a mask she had to

762
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.599
wear for the public luckily she did have
a supportive family with whom she didn't

763
00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:55.920
have to wear it christina's take seems
to be that jones simply wasn't able to

764
00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.040
take that mask off at all
and resorted to drastic behavior

765
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.760
when the porcelain started to crack but
with all the hatred toward the story and

766
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.599
toward christina
it does boggle my mind that hollywood

767
00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:13.119
was so horny to get this movie made as
soon as the book came out you couldn't

768
00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:16.240
find anyone who had anything good to say
about it

769
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.839
faye dunaway herself agreed to play the
role as long as it was more respectful

770
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:22.799
to jones memory
than the book

771
00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:27.520
though christina's book was obviously an
exploitation book the first one of its

772
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.280
kind
my task was to portray a woman a full

773
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.559
woman
who she was in all her facets

774
00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:39.040
not just one
i tried to illuminate who this woman was

775
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.440
but it was more than just about being
angry it was about trying to examine and

776
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.799
explore the forces that undermined her
i don't think faye and i watched the

777
00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:51.760
same movie christina actually did not
feel that dunaway's performance

778
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.880
accurately depicted her mother
specifically claiming that dunaway's

779
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.359
depiction of joan was far more monstrous
than she ever experienced is that

780
00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:02.720
anywhere near the way joan crawford
actually acted

781
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.319
only the makeup faye dunaway
specifically went out of her way to

782
00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:11.520
manipulate the script the director and
producers to humanize joan all the while

783
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.440
lambasting the book as tabloid drivel
only for the author of that drivel

784
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.160
to decry the performance for depicting a
monster it also didn't help that dunaway

785
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.640
was already kind of a diva
once again ironically joan crawford was

786
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.319
quoted saying of all the actresses to me
only faye dunaway has the talent and the

787
00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:36.640
class and the courage it takes to make a
real star

788
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.880
dunaway later blamed mommy dearest for
hurting her career and given that she

789
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.599
was a bit of a hot ticket actress before
the 80s she was forced into roles in

790
00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:49.599
smaller films for the rest of her life
and on one hand you may say it's because

791
00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:53.520
of her performance but plenty of actors
have had bad roles maybe nothing so

792
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.119
monumental is this but fey was a bit of
a

793
00:56:57.119 --> 00:57:01.280
hassle you see on top of being a prima
donna in general she allegedly

794
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.799
terrorized the set of mommy dearest for
starters she refused to drop out of

795
00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:08.480
character during production so on top of
delivering

796
00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.720
that on camera
the crew and cast had to live with that

797
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.280
for weeks routania alda who played jones
assistant in the film wrote a

798
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.760
behind-the-scenes memoir about the
filming experience she wrote people

799
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.240
despised faye because she was rude to
people everyone was on pins and needles

800
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.319
when she worked and relaxed when she
didn't to name a few things faye

801
00:57:30.319 --> 00:57:34.960
allegedly manipulated the director to
rob other actors of their screen time to

802
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.119
pull it to herself she also insisted
that people on set needed to turn away

803
00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:42.160
from her while she was performing
because

804
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.559
she didn't want an audience
regarding her method acting and will

805
00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:50.559
avoid a discussion about what method
acting really is and how a lot of actors

806
00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:55.200
misuse the term dunaway had the usual
nonsense to say but with an extra twist

807
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.359
if your mind is on a woman who is dead
and you're trying to find out who she

808
00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:03.599
was and do right by her
you do feel a presence

809
00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:07.760
i felt it at home at night sometimes
it wasn't pleasant

810
00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.040
i felt joan was not at rest so i think
what happened

811
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.799
is that faye was so engaged with the
memory of joan

812
00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:20.799
that she may have spurred a vindictive
streak against christina and so she kind

813
00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:26.400
of took out all that bottled up rage
on the effigy of christina which is why

814
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:31.520
you got all this aggression i think well
there was an initial wave of critics who

815
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.640
hailed her performance
it didn't take long for the public

816
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.119
perception to swing the other way
going down as one of the best bad

817
00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:43.680
performances of all time a serious
actress like faye dunaway did not cotton

818
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.160
to that idea she blamed the director for
not reeling her back she blamed the

819
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.680
editors and the producers for taking her
depiction of a

820
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.559
window into a tormented soul and making
it camp she blamed christina and her

821
00:58:56.559 --> 00:59:00.880
husband she blamed christina's book and
worst of all she blamed her audience for

822
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.880
not taking away her intended
interpretation though she has come

823
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.760
around to the unforeseen fandom of the
film

824
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:12.559
but still doesn't quite get
what they see in it because make no

825
00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:17.200
mistake there is a fandom around this
moving picture little did dunaway know

826
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.160
she had opened the floodgates to a whole
fandom that had only until then existed

827
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.720
in burlesque shows a fandom that upon
the movie's release would hang christina

828
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.319
crawford in effigy
mommy dearest

829
00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:35.040
legitimized a whole group of audiences
and creators who were going to do what

830
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.760
dunaway did
but do it on purpose

831
00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.839
with or without the ghost of joan
crawford

832
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:52.000
believe it or not studio heads rarely
know what they're doing which is how you

833
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.599
can have money catapulted at projects
like cleopatra or mommy dearest

834
00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:01.680
and especially in the case of the latter
all that ends up doing is giving an

835
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.280
inflated budget to the kind of
overwrought and overacted content that

836
01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.200
you would get in what is considered b
cinema and especially if that high

837
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.720
budget b movie pulls in an audience
creators who love be cinema

838
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.960
are going to feel very validated like
quentin tarantino growing up on martial

839
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.960
arts movies and then getting to make one
of his own with a hollywood budget and

840
01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.240
kill bill could also be described as
camp for any number of reasons but when

841
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.119
it specifically came to feminine-centric
burlesque aesthetic the 1980s opened a

842
01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:35.280
lot of doors to have producers approve
movies with

843
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.119
more obvious camp sensibilities

844
01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:44.559
nothing about a movie that was
exclusively made to ape off of the

845
01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:49.680
success of a board game implies that
said movie would end up becoming a camp

846
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.319
milestone but here we are in 1985
paramount pictures distributed clue the

847
01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:58.480
movie which yes
is directly inspired by the board game

848
01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.040
and they didn't really seem to care what
it was as long as there was a movie

849
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.400
based on it the qualifications for
meeting the outline parameters were

850
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.559
incredibly vague which could have gone
one of two ways either you get a movie

851
01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:13.359
that follows the path of least
resistance and you end up with a product

852
01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:17.760
that is phenomenally lackluster and
lifeless or you hand it to a bunch of

853
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.160
enthusiastic creatives who really want
to use that lack of specifics to play

854
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.280
around with what they can do and really
when you're told you have to make a

855
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.960
movie about a murder with a collection
of arbitrary if not otherwise entirely

856
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.200
mundane objects in a fabulous mansion
with secret passages with a number of

857
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.680
outrageous murder suspects if you're not
feeding into the natural absurdity then

858
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.680
you're not doing your job clue the board
game is focused around up to six players

859
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.160
named after colors there are nine rooms
in the mansion and six murder weapons

860
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.160
the premise is that mr body the
fabulously wealthy estate owner is

861
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.039
murdered at a party attended by all the
suspects each suspect weapon and room

862
01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:01.440
has a corresponding card each group is
shuffled and one from each is selected

863
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.960
and put in an envelope to be revealed at
the end of the game players move their

864
01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.200
selected token around the board going to
each room looking for clues at any time

865
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.960
after viewing any number of clue cards
not in the envelope a player can make a

866
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.960
guess at which three cards are in the
envelope to win a player must guess all

867
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.960
three correctly if the guess is wrong
the player loses by default and is

868
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.079
removed from the game in-game lore is
that

869
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:27.920
they're murdered by the real murderer
clue the movie features references to

870
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.000
every single facet of the game including
corresponding secret passages saying

871
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.079
each room by name and having each murder
weapon included the primary difference

872
01:02:36.079 --> 01:02:39.760
is the addition of several characters
wadsworth the butler played by tim curry

873
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.480
yvette the maid the cook the cop the
motorist and the singing telegram girl

874
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.400
wadsworth and yvette specifically add an
extra element to the story as they

875
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.240
function as the rule book they explain
to the players what this game is another

876
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.079
difference is that mr body is not the
only body nearly everyone added to the

877
01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:59.359
plot is there to get murdered with a
different murder weapon the way it goes

878
01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:03.520
is that six guests who seem to have no
relation to each other are invited to mr

879
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.520
body's mansion for reasons unknown
presumably some costume party they are

880
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.880
told to only use provided monikers
colonel mustard mrs white mrs peacock mr

881
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.280
green professor plum and miss scarlet
wadsworth guides them through the rules

882
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.039
of the evening's festivities and after
introductions reveals that he has

883
01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:26.079
brought them here because they are all
connected to their absent host mr body

884
01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:29.440
though none of them know mr body
directly he has been secretly

885
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.440
blackmailing all of them and wadsworth
wants them to join together to testify

886
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.000
against mr body and have him arrested mr
boddy shows up prepared for this mutiny

887
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.400
and has brought with him a number of
murder weapons and proposes that instead

888
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.400
they murder wadsworth and save
themselves the public disgrace however

889
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.400
the lights go out and mister body is
murdered before the lights come back on

890
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.599
and then the plot gets too deliberately
convoluted to release an opposite size

891
01:03:55.599 --> 01:04:00.079
they need to figure out who killed mr
body before the police arrive but then

892
01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:04.000
people
keep dying and nobody out of the core 7

893
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.359
can figure out who's doing it so they
all split up to search the manor in

894
01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:11.359
pairs for the murderer before concluding
that the murderer is in fact one of them

895
01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:15.039
all the while new people are showing up
at the house and also being murdered

896
01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:20.240
this movie racks up quite the mr body
count the film is less about plot and

897
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.520
more about giving some of these
outrageous personalities the chance to

898
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.240
interact with each other you've got war
criminals and embezzlers a phone service

899
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.680
madam a black widow who allegedly killed
her husband a professor on thin ice for

900
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.440
having relations with his students and a
gay man so it's like the republican

901
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.200
national convention the film's plot is
also a parody of mccarthyist communist

902
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.920
witch hunts and a juxtaposition of true
american morality being upheld by this

903
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.160
reviled group of people and to top off
the sunday when the film was released

904
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.319
they shot three endings and shipped out
versions to theaters at random there was

905
01:04:54.319 --> 01:04:58.880
no way to be sure which ending which
theater was getting two of the endings

906
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:04.160
incriminated either miss scarlett or mrs
peacock but the third true ending

907
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.640
revealed that wadsworth was the real mr
body and that he brought them all there

908
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.079
to cover his tracks and help him erase
his evidence however it turns out mr

909
01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:19.520
green the gay one was an undercover fbi
agent and kills mr body now

910
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.200
like martha baby jane and eve harrington
camp is used to highlight the

911
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.680
ridiculousness of social conventions in
this instance though it's on purpose but

912
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.559
the primary reason why this movie gets
remembered is because of this cast of

913
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:37.839
characters specifically these horrible
women who in spite of being horrible to

914
01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:41.359
slay
in all cases literally actually the

915
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:44.880
differences from the aforementioned
examples is that clue does not make any

916
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.640
attempt to tone down these characters
they were deliberately comedic and what

917
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.240
made them entertaining revolved around
distilling the most outrageous elements

918
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.200
of them and making that the whole
character start with outrageous

919
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.960
personalities and then build the world
and plot to match that energy the

920
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.520
shenanigans that are considered
normal in this world fit

921
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.440
because everyone is living in it if
everyone's absurd then absurd is the new

922
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.680
normal what also helped is that each
caricature is built around a specific

923
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.160
expression of gender and so gender
becomes the highlight of each character

924
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.079
which is how you ended up with a cast
that more or less focused upon a

925
01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:24.799
collection of very heightened women and
tim curry and a supposedly gay character

926
01:06:24.799 --> 01:06:29.200
which is what gave the gays something to
latch on to i hated her

927
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:36.079
so
much it the it flame flames flames

928
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:40.079
on the side of my face and while clue
has its underground cult of queer fans

929
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.520
who know this is a
much better 80s comedy than the

930
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.280
reagan-era jerk-off fest that was
ghostbusters the movie did not make its

931
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.400
money back at the box office part of the
reason may have been the studio

932
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.960
overspending on a movie based on a board
game that mystery isn't so hard to

933
01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.280
figure out

934
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.559
for the longest time campy movies were
stuck to small budgets

935
01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:10.240
and while it may have been because of
mommy dearest that they began to get

936
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.000
pulled into the mainstream
they struggled to perform well among

937
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.359
mainstream audiences in theaters as
mentioned with clue but that isn't to

938
01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:20.559
say that there
weren't times when they did turn a

939
01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:24.720
profit and times that they did start
getting handed substantial budgets and

940
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.200
starring actors who were once again
hot off of oscar wins believe it or not

941
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.200
actors are people too which means a lot
of them don't mind being in frivolously

942
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.720
fun movies they get to chew the scenery
like fae but in a film environment that

943
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.559
won't hurt their career because the
movie was never meant to be taken

944
01:07:40.559 --> 01:07:45.280
seriously acting can be fun but it's a
bit of a drag if every role you do is

945
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.400
choosing between which of your children
should die in a concentration camp yeah

946
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.039
you'd be kidding yourself if i wasn't
going to find a reason to talk about

947
01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:55.039
death becomes her and meryl streep it
takes a lot of talent to make bad acting

948
01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:58.960
look this good because it's not just
about being a bad actor or giving a

949
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.640
deliberately bad performance everyone in
a scene needs to be collectively

950
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.480
developing the sensibilities they want
to project if you have an over-the-top

951
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.559
character acting off of a wooden
character it's just not going to be

952
01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:14.240
entertaining there are popular comedies
where everyone is completely wooden like

953
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.279
napoleon dynamite if anyone remembers
there really i'm not sure why it made

954
01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:20.719
such a splash
maybe i'm just gay i don't know if

955
01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:24.799
everyone is acting with the same kind of
badness then it generates a world state

956
01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:28.239
that the audience can take for granted
and engage with and people who act

957
01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:33.520
normal are the odd ones look i'm cold
i'm wet and i'm just plain scared i'm

958
01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.520
here nothing to worry about
i was actually tempted to talk about

959
01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.400
rocky horror as a case study in this one
but

960
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.759
there's enough there that it's gonna
have to have its own video anyway death

961
01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:49.359
becomes her star's meryl streep after
she had already won two academy awards

962
01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.719
and goldie hawn who had already won one
both had been receiving nominations

963
01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:57.839
since the 70s han was markedly more of a
comedic actress and meryl herself was

964
01:08:57.839 --> 01:09:02.080
taking a turn toward more lighthearted
material as she moved into her 40s the

965
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.440
film was also meant to feature carrie
fisher a good friend of meryl streep

966
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.960
streep starred in postcards from the
edge two years prior a movie based on

967
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.960
fisher's autobiographical book of the
same name it was an ambiguously

968
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.440
fictionalized account of fisher's own
experience with rehab and her own mother

969
01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.000
she refused to specify which elements of
the story were based on fact and which

970
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.880
were fictionalized
for reasons you only remember the bad

971
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.920
stuff don't you
what about the big band that i got to

972
01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.799
play at that party do you remember that
no you only remember that my skirt

973
01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:39.839
accidentally twirled up
and you weren't wearing any underwear

974
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:44.080
well but carrie's role was cut from the
story to save time she was also cast as

975
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.520
miss scarlet and clue but had to drop
out of the role when she was admitted to

976
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.159
rehab don't do drugs kids anyway without
carrie meryl an actress who had come up

977
01:09:52.159 --> 01:09:56.480
via the stage was nearly driven to the
brink of madness due to the struggle she

978
01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.560
had while working with the special
effects something princess leia would

979
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.159
have probably been able to help her with
because though critics didn't really get

980
01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:09.679
the movie the special effects were
cutting edge for the time

981
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.719
yes no death becomes her fits all the
stops of camp's sensibilities to a

982
01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:19.120
science it's vapid conceited
feminine-centric over-acted and goes out

983
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.560
of its way to try and tell you that it
has no substance but is instead a

984
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.719
showcase of style meryl plays madison
ashton a broadway actress who's famous

985
01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:32.480
without anyone being sure why she's
famous in spite of her acclaim people

986
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.320
struggle to tolerate her talent enter
helen sharp a childhood friend of

987
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.719
ashton's played by han an author who is
engaged to a renowned plastic surgeon

988
01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:43.920
ernest melville helen takes him to see
one of madison shows and though the

989
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.560
audience can't really stomach whatever
it is that she's doing dr melville seems

990
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.880
to be an avid fan sharp tentatively
takes him to meet her old friend

991
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.960
backstage where we see that ashton is
frustrated with the growing lines on her

992
01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.960
face what better fit for her than a
plastic surgeon in their apartment helen

993
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.840
confesses that this meeting was a test
that madison has stolen every man from

994
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.480
her and that before they got married
she wanted to make sure that ernest

995
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.199
could be immune to madison's siren song
he's not as one would expect of a comedy

996
01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:19.520
pushing women into excessive levels of
drama ernest's betrayal of helen pushes

997
01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.440
her into a spiral that lasts over seven
years to articulate that she has hit

998
01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.560
rock bottom han is stuffed into an
outrageous fat suit lives surrounded by

999
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.800
her cats eats icing from the can and
torments herself by watching ashton's

1000
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.239
horrible movies madison's career in
spite of her talentlessness has

1001
01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:40.800
skyrocketed due to her youthful visage
assisted by her husband helen is dragged

1002
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.800
to a mental institution where the very
name ashton drives other patients into a

1003
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:50.239
frenzy because she just can't stop
talking about her madeline

1004
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.880
and when she is reprimanded by a
therapist for refusing to let go of

1005
01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.360
madison
she realizes

1006
01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.800
what an excellent idea it would be
to eliminate madison fast forward

1007
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.400
another seven years and we pick up with
madison and earnest ernest has been

1008
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.480
driven to dire alcoholism and is now a
reconstructive mortician since his

1009
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.159
career as a plastic surgeon fell through
though he is considered the best at what

1010
01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:18.800
he does painting dead bodies madison's
career has also all but dried up which

1011
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.800
she blames on her aged visage they're
invited to a party for the release of

1012
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.400
helen's new book forever young a
collection of youth and beauty tips

1013
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.360
madison agrees to attend for the chance
to torment her once friend yet again

1014
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.080
going to her spa for regular face
treatment and receiving an oh so sketch

1015
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.400
business card for an elite service
madison initially blows it off but when

1016
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.440
she finds helen is shockingly youthful
and gorgeous she is thrown into a

1017
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.920
nosedive desperate she drives to the
address on the card a grand gothic

1018
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.520
castle in the heart of beverly hills
which is actually not that unrealistic

1019
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.280
the estate proprietor reveals herself to
be 71 years old despite appearing

1020
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.159
to be a woman in her 30s or her 20s how
old would you guess i am 38

1021
01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:12.320
28. she offers madison an opportunity
a potion of eternal youth for a steep

1022
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.760
fee and the promise that madison will
stage her own death after a certain

1023
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.040
number of years she hesitantly takes the
potion and is left with a warning now a

1024
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.920
warning
take care of yourself

1025
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.480
you and your body are going to be
together a long time

1026
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.120
meanwhile helen goes to ashton's mansion
and seduces her former fiance she

1027
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.080
convinces him that they can be happy
forever

1028
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.159
as long as he kills madison ashton she
outlines her whole plan and when it

1029
01:13:42.159 --> 01:13:47.120
seems like he's committed she leaves
madison returns now youthful and without

1030
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.920
a single care in the world and as one of
those cares was once earnest she no

1031
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.560
longer has to hide her contempt for him
in a heated argument he pushes her down

1032
01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.880
their gorgeous marble staircase but as
ernest calls helen to tell her in a

1033
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.640
panic that he accidentally killed
madison in a way that

1034
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.679
doesn't fit the plan madison
picks herself up and twists herself back

1035
01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:14.400
together when taken to the emergency
room it is revealed that she's

1036
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:20.320
dead maybe my wrist i don't know but my
neck feels sort of sore what better fit

1037
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.440
for her than a reconstructive mortician
ernest takes this as a miracle and as a

1038
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.520
sign that he is meant to be with madison
forever perpetually fixing her up and

1039
01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.600
keeping her skin radiating that healthy
glow that only a makeup airbrush can

1040
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.880
achieve helen
isn't a fan of the idea as it so happens

1041
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.840
madison isn't a fan of her she takes a
shotgun from a display and blasts helen

1042
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.320
into a fountain in the atrium taking
ernest aside madison explains how they

1043
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.719
will hide the body while helen picks
herself up madison deduces that helen

1044
01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:56.800
drank the same potion that she did and
naturally the first thing she does is

1045
01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:00.960
read helen for filth for writing a book
about youth tips after drinking a potion

1046
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.640
of eternal youth fake [ __ ] calling
out fake [ __ ] in eternal deadlock

1047
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.560
there's only one way for them to settle
the score

1048
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.360
on guard
[ __ ] you may have always won but you

1049
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.800
never played fair oh

1050
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.239
who cares how i played i won realizing
the fight is going nowhere the girls

1051
01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:25.679
settle down to have a heart to heart it
turns out the reason madison set out to

1052
01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:28.080
steal every one of helen's men is
because

1053
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.040
well
madison grew up in a lower income

1054
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.120
bracket than helen and in high school
madison thought that helen thought she

1055
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.280
was trash and helen agrees she did think
that madison was trash they realized

1056
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.960
that this petty squabble over boys was
never real it was just something that

1057
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.719
they were doing to hurt each other and
that they don't have to hurt each other

1058
01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:51.440
anymore within five minutes they go from
literally killing each other to being

1059
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.600
best friends girls
i'm so glad i'm gay the last time ernest

1060
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.920
saw these women they were going for the
throat now they're best friends begging

1061
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.360
ernest to spray paint helen into a
normal skin tone nothing to be done

1062
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.880
about the hole in her stomach but just
means she can't wear a two-piece anymore

1063
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.440
ernest now sees that this is not a
miracle this is a curse and that after

1064
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.560
giving helen a fresh coat he's done and
gone but the girls come to a realization

1065
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.840
what happens when they need a touch-up
and even if they hold him hostage what

1066
01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.480
happens if he dies so the kidnap him and
take him to the immortal woman where she

1067
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.750
makes a pretty convincing argument for
him to drink the potion

1068
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.850
[Music]

1069
01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.199
i mean i'm sold ernest decides that
immortal living seems cold and lonely

1070
01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:39.440
and then tries to escape from the castle
and then immediately finds himself at

1071
01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.320
the center of a convention of immortal
celebrities most of whom are those who

1072
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.239
we've speculated to have faked their
deaths to escape the spotlight like

1073
01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:52.640
elvis and jim morrison helen and madison
chase him through the house pressuring

1074
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.600
him to reconsider ernest chooses to fall
to his death but instead

1075
01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.320
survives and escapes 37 years later
we're at ernest's funeral with the rest

1076
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.760
of his life he became a philanthropist
adventurer and a wonderful person

1077
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.040
hilarious considering a point is made of
him being a republican do you know what

1078
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.760
they do to soft
bald

1079
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.679
overweight republicans in prison helen
and madison sit in the back of the

1080
01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:19.280
church bitching at each other under
their veils the minister's eulogy says

1081
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.600
that through kindness and charity and
the people he left to remember him

1082
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.960
fondly ernest found the secret to
eternal life the girls excuse themselves

1083
01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.600
from the surface flipping off the veils
and oh god they uh

1084
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.960
needle each other for their poor makeup
skills and reference past injuries that

1085
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.960
further deteriorated their bodies while
bickering about where they parked the

1086
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.159
car and whose responsibility it was to
keep track helen

1087
01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:49.840
ends up teetering on the edge of some
steps with madison considering just

1088
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.320
letting her fall but they're friends and
helen insists that they fall together

1089
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.960
girls the film didn't do great
critically but made a tidy profit on top

1090
01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.159
of becoming a mainstay for queer
audiences i feel that while mommy

1091
01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:07.120
dearest typified camp on an accidental
level death becomes her is the perfect

1092
01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.679
instance of how to create intentional
badness with a budget i find a lot of

1093
01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:15.440
those intentionally bad movies tend to
get a little stale halfway through

1094
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.080
because they keep leaning on the same
sensibility when it comes to good bad

1095
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.760
movies you really need to keep switching
up the energy and leaning on plot

1096
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.280
inconsistencies to keep the audience on
their toes like in death becomes her

1097
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.280
when the story is retroactively changed
in the second half in the opening we see

1098
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.239
madison as glamorous successful and
confident helen is mousy dull and does

1099
01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:40.400
not seem to be thriving however later on
the backstory is seemingly changed with

1100
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.800
no prior indication madison was the poor
and unglamorous one and it was helen who

1101
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.719
was elegant this is never addressed or
explained and in both instances the plot

1102
01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:53.600
was crafted like this specifically to
sell emotional development whereas

1103
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.520
continuity
wasn't seen as important in many ways

1104
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.600
this typifies the style of narrative
that is trying to be everything to the

1105
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.080
point where not only did critics not see
the value in this comedy but they wholly

1106
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.080
bought into the projected vapidity and
shallowness of the characters the film

1107
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.120
was decried as having no substance at
all when in fact there's a strong

1108
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.360
communicated message about gender
normativity and presentation societal

1109
01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.199
expectations and the role of women in
hollywood it's not even that hard to see

1110
01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:27.360
it unless you yourself are embedded in
the world that the movie is making a

1111
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.920
parody of because this movie like all
good camp is criticizing the normativity

1112
01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.560
of society by highlighting the absurdity
of social expectations that an old man

1113
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.880
can become beloved by all but old women
fall into obscurity this camp is funny

1114
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.080
because it's pointing out exactly why
these social tropes are so absurd

1115
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.520
by depicting these people as acting the
way society expects them to and you know

1116
01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:55.679
women like this
especially in hollywood

1117
01:19:55.679 --> 01:19:59.120
are
rumored to exist certainly one of the

1118
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:05.040
memorable scenes in mommy dearest is the
clothes closet scene

1119
01:20:08.719 --> 01:20:11.890
if it had occurred i can understand why
it did

1120
01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:19.120
[Music]
now camp as a style of comedy was still

1121
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.400
a bit niche
and people who weren't in the know

1122
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.920
might not have bought tickets what was
mistaken about mommy dearest is that it

1123
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.320
was not necessarily the film that drew
the fandom but the diva herself

1124
01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.159
and indeed a large component of camp was
rooted in diva worship and there are few

1125
01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:40.560
who so perfectly embody the deliberate
camp diva than the mistress of the dark

1126
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.080
herself cassandra peterson better known
by her stage name and iconic persona

1127
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.960
elvira a struggling actress peterson
showed up to audition for what was meant

1128
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.920
to be a temporary gig to stand in for
vampira a morticia adams type host of a

1129
01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.760
local los angeles tv show that showed
bad cheap b horror movies elvira was a

1130
01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.159
sexy parody of vampyra who is a parody
of martisha who is a parody of the

1131
01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:09.600
monster ladies of classic hollywood
horror movies with each separation from

1132
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.679
the source material each version more
honestly projected why the former woman

1133
01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:18.400
had a fandom until you got to elvira who
represented the purest expression of why

1134
01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.639
producers continued to carry on the
trope boobs peterson herself is a

1135
01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:26.159
worldly and intelligent lady who
specifically had a strong hand in

1136
01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:30.159
crafting the character the sexual
exploitation of the character itself is

1137
01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:34.159
a parody of hollywood production values
when it comes to designing women and

1138
01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:37.280
depicting women in general alvaro was
just

1139
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.880
stripping away the posturing boobs and
once again we're in a place where the

1140
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.360
straights have
no idea why the gays are so drawn to a

1141
01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.360
woman who builds 80 of her comedic
material around her cleavage without

1142
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.760
realizing that it's because she's making
fun of the people who are too hypnotized

1143
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:57.440
by her undulating memories to notice
that she's making fun of them in a

1144
01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.679
loving way of course so every week
elvira relaxed while gleefully torturing

1145
01:22:01.679 --> 01:22:06.000
the audience with bad movie after bad
movie popping in once in a while to let

1146
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.320
the audience know she was in just as
much pain as they were her popularity

1147
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.480
skyrocketed as the show started being
syndicated around the country eventually

1148
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.960
leading to her strutting her way onto
the big screen in elvira mistress of the

1149
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:23.600
dark absolute classic that must be seen
by everyone mistress of the dark follows

1150
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.159
alvirah as she angrily quits her job
hosting a bad movie tv show when the

1151
01:22:28.159 --> 01:22:33.040
station's new owner sexually harasses
her she's going to start an act in vegas

1152
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.360
but needs 50 grand to make the project
work that's a bit of a problem since

1153
01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.360
well she doesn't have 50 grand but as
luck would have it her great aunt

1154
01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.280
morgana just bit the dust and left her
an inheritance so she packs up her

1155
01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:49.760
fabulous convertible and heads on to
falwell massachusetts which she soon

1156
01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.960
discovers is filled with the most
conservative boring uptight bunch of

1157
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.639
backward-thinking people she's ever met
there's a reason the town is named after

1158
01:22:56.639 --> 01:23:00.800
the notoriously conservative and
queer-hating televangelist jerry falwell

1159
01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.679
and here she discovers that her
inheritance

1160
01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:08.159
is actually her great-aunts dilapidated
house and her poodle so she's stuck in

1161
01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:12.159
this ratchet-ass little town until she
can sell the place the only monetary

1162
01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:17.120
offer she gets is 50 for a recipe book
from her then unknown uncle vincent she

1163
01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.400
agrees to sell it but before she can
things go awry almost every adult in

1164
01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.480
town decides that she's basically the
devil incarnate though the teenagers

1165
01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.880
love her the townspeople try burning her
at the stake anyway but as she has at

1166
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.520
least a little bit of luck it turns out
great aunt morgana was actually a witch

1167
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.840
the recipe book was a spell book and she
can harness some elemental forces using

1168
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.080
a ring she found laying around the house
which brings a downpour that doses the

1169
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.760
fire but now there's a new problem
because uncle vincent is actually a

1170
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.080
warlock and he wants that spell book so
he can do evil warlock things elvira

1171
01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.760
leads the vicious old man back to her
house where they engage in a magical

1172
01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.239
battle that sets the place on fire but
elvira wins out in the end and banishes

1173
01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:04.239
vincent to the underworld while the
house and all the magical artifacts are

1174
01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:08.719
destroyed the silver lining she was
vincent's only living relative

1175
01:24:08.719 --> 01:24:12.960
so she gets his estate after his death
leaving her with enough money to hit the

1176
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.360
road and start her vegas show the movie
didn't do great at the box office when

1177
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.080
first released but has become a cult
classic for gays and horror fans alike

1178
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.239
the obvious parallels of being an
outsider in a small town are

1179
01:24:26.239 --> 01:24:30.639
well obvious but became a big draw for
queer audiences not only was elvira an

1180
01:24:30.639 --> 01:24:35.520
outspoken ally even in the 1980s holding
fundraisers to help aids victims but she

1181
01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.080
knew exactly what being in a small town
and not being normal was like she goes

1182
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.199
so far as inviting all the town's
teenagers over to her house to spruce

1183
01:24:43.199 --> 01:24:47.760
the place up transforming the dingy gray
exterior into a cascade of rainbows and

1184
01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.280
more than a few of the cast members
actually were queer because alvirah

1185
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.440
attracts us like flies to a gorgeous
corpse she also dedicated the film to

1186
01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.800
robert redding a close friend who helped
create the iconic look of elvira but

1187
01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.239
passed away from complications with aids
in 1986.

1188
01:25:04.239 --> 01:25:06.960
she even named the love interest in the
film after him

1189
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.440
since the film's release elvira has
remained an icon in the queer and horror

1190
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.440
communities and last year when she
released her autobiography yours cruelly

1191
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.199
elvira she revealed to the world that
she'd been in a loving relationship with

1192
01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:24.960
another woman since 2002 fully cementing
her queer icon status she'd been worried

1193
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.639
about coming out for years
because she was convinced her fan base

1194
01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:32.000
would abandon her of course considering
her fan base is made up of horny

1195
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.280
straight guys women and gay men with
good taste i don't think she had to

1196
01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.639
worry nearly as much as she did but
going back to mistress of the dark an

1197
01:25:38.639 --> 01:25:43.199
interesting tidbit of information is
that tim burton was actually in the

1198
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:47.120
running to direct and was alvira's pick
for the job since he'd done such a great

1199
01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.800
job with peewee's big adventure and she
was good friends with paul rubins

1200
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.960
pee-wee herman but tim burton didn't get
his dark campy hands on the mistress of

1201
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.159
the dark
he was too busy to take on the job

1202
01:25:58.159 --> 01:26:02.560
because of two other movies first came
beetlejuice and exercise a pure camp in

1203
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:09.000
and of itself
and then the camp noir classic

1204
01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.400
meow
[Music]

1205
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.639
camp as an aesthetic
can be seen in good cinema

1206
01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:26.000
the thing is
you need to build an entire world from

1207
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.800
the ground up this world needs to
visibly function on a separate set of

1208
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.400
established laws
laws to which the visual and written

1209
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.679
aspects relentlessly adhere this must be
a world where this manner of action and

1210
01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:44.639
style is projected to an audience for
whom their sense of reality is locked in

1211
01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:50.000
the suspension of disbelief so everyone
involved in the process needs to commit

1212
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.679
which is probably a rule for absurdism
or fantasy rather than one exclusively

1213
01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:59.760
limited to camp which itself may be a
sub-genre of absurdism using these rules

1214
01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.639
there are times albeit rare
where camp sensibilities break through a

1215
01:27:04.639 --> 01:27:09.440
cult audience and end up being must-see
movies as is the case with tim burton's

1216
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.520
batman movies specifically batman
returns but it's worth pointing out that

1217
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.000
1989's batman is something i like to
describe as camp noir taking every

1218
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.400
individual trope of noir sensibilities
and pushing it to impractical heights

1219
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.280
design takes precedence over everything
else the bat suit he could not move in

1220
01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.800
the batmobile with the transmission that
would just get ripped out from a single

1221
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.520
pothole the joker's singular marriage to
his clownish brand it's usually not

1222
01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.960
considered camp
because

1223
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.239
well because it's enjoyed by straight
men and if straight men enjoy something

1224
01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:47.120
it must be higher than camp but it does
say quite a bit about being a social

1225
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.480
outsider
batman returns just does it all better

1226
01:27:52.960 --> 01:28:00.800
i am just jealous because i'm a genuine
freak and you have to wear a mask

1227
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.960
batman 89 was briefly the highest
grossing movie of all time and while

1228
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.040
batman returns made its budget back and
then some it only made about half as

1229
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:14.159
much at the box office and cost much
more to make batman returns though is

1230
01:28:14.159 --> 01:28:17.600
the one that does get remembered on
account of there being more memorable

1231
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.040
moments and though critics lauded this
movie as being superior to its

1232
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.320
predecessor
parents

1233
01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:28.800
felt this movie was a bit too dark for
their children so danny what did you

1234
01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.840
think of the movie
it was very violent it was a total

1235
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.159
attack against kids the whole movie what
a little narc no really this movie

1236
01:28:38.159 --> 01:28:42.639
became a rallying cry for parents groups
this kid can read off his memorized

1237
01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:46.800
script that the producers fed him before
the segment sure but it doesn't change

1238
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:54.280
the fact that kids movies of the day
could get very violent

1239
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.400
not to mention jurassic park was only
one year away so parents groups can

1240
01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.480
scapegoat the violence all they like
they can target the dark imagery but

1241
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.520
what's really going on is an attack
against what they really have a problem

1242
01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.840
with
i am cad woman

1243
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.760
i mean catwoman was always meant to be a
little sexy and this is true going all

1244
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.520
the way back to julie newmar and eartha
kitt and early comic books but this is a

1245
01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.280
suit that michelle pfeiffer had to get
stitched into and this is a character

1246
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.440
that specifically used sex as a weapon
in a way that was closer to basic

1247
01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.400
instinct than adam west you poor guys
always confusing your pistols with your

1248
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.400
prize

1249
01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.600
and yes the plot of this movie is that
batman is out to stop the penguin and

1250
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.600
expose him for being a gang leader while
he's running for mayor such in such

1251
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.440
contrivances the real through line of
the movie though is carried by selena

1252
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.560
kyle her dual identity with catwoman and
the chaos that occupies her mind

1253
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.400
burton's batman movies were comfortable
playing fast and loose with character

1254
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.679
lore the important thing was that the
character represented the essence of

1255
01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:35.120
what the character in the comics was
which is why nobody is particularly up

1256
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:38.800
in arms about how the first movie gave
the joker a name and a backstory and

1257
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.239
also why they were comfortable with the
changes made to the penguin and catwoman

1258
01:30:42.239 --> 01:30:45.600
instead of being a street kid who
deployed martial arts and gymnastics to

1259
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.760
carry out heists selena is an
overstressed overworked underachieving

1260
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:54.800
assistant to mack shrek shrek himself
being this parody of trumpian business

1261
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:59.760
moguls of the 1980s while selena is
competent in her work attempts she makes

1262
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.800
to break that glass ceiling cut deeper
the further she reaches her apartment is

1263
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.520
pink and bright stuffed with doll houses
frilly pillows and stuffed animals and

1264
01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.040
despite her attempt to appear as girlish
as possible in order to seem attractive

1265
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.159
to men
she just can't bring herself to pretend

1266
01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:20.239
to be less talented and smart than she
is she gets home to a message on her

1267
01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:23.679
answering machine where her boyfriend is
dumping her because she refuses to let

1268
01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:28.080
him win tennis matches she also hears a
message she left for herself telling her

1269
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.480
exhausted post-work variant that she
needs to go back to the office to do

1270
01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.360
something she predicted that she would
forget so back she goes where she alone

1271
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.120
finds the truth of a proposed power
plant that max is trying to sell to the

1272
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:45.520
city of gotham he plans to drain power
from the city to hold it hostage when

1273
01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.440
confronted by him she's perfectly fine
to keep this all under the table and be

1274
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.760
a good little secretary but max doesn't
really seem to like the idea of loose

1275
01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.679
ends and pushes her out a window whether
she miraculously survives with severe

1276
01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:02.239
head trauma or whether she died and was
resurrected by cat magic is unclear she

1277
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:06.480
makes her way home a zombie of herself
and by force of habit turns her

1278
01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.840
answering machine on when she hears a
message about a service offering tips

1279
01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.960
for how to seduce and marry your boss
she snaps ripping her apartment apart

1280
01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:19.600
she targets the soft pink things she had
collected and takes a can of black spray

1281
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:25.040
paint to the walls and dollhouse she
so i raked havoc on some old denim and i

1282
01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.239
did what any girl would do
chaos

1283
01:32:28.239 --> 01:32:33.199
she chooses chaos she becomes catwoman
and sets out to destroy any man who has

1284
01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:37.120
wronged her which not only is max but
anyone who stands between her and her

1285
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.159
plan to destroy him like he destroyed
her which includes the batman and after

1286
01:32:42.159 --> 01:32:46.639
an uneasy alliance falls out the penguin
too all while wearing a mask that she

1287
01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:51.120
feels is more comfortable than her face
not all that much unlike john crawford

1288
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.440
selena herself is locked in a dualistic
psychological state between the woman

1289
01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:00.080
she convinced herself she had to be and
the wild unpredictable hedonistic and

1290
01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.239
reactionary catwoman all the while
selena goes through her nine lives for

1291
01:33:04.239 --> 01:33:09.280
nothing but trying to exist separately
from a man's world at a masquerade party

1292
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.280
where bruce and selena attend without
masks because their faces are the masks

1293
01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.520
bruce tries his best to talk down selena
from outright murdering max

1294
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.520
but criminal justice in this society
even if he did get sentenced to more

1295
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.679
than just a slap on the wrist is not
justice for selena she uses up lives

1296
01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:30.320
four through eight to get that revenge
and then mysteriously vanishes

1297
01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.080
now aside from establishing an
environment where line delivery like

1298
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.280
this is camp in itself as i was saying
i'm a woman and can't be taken for

1299
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.159
granted
life's a [ __ ] now so am i it's kind of

1300
01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:48.719
a crime that this movie isn't held up as
a sleeper feminist hit from the 90s it's

1301
01:33:48.719 --> 01:33:53.280
very easy to read selena's murder by max
as an allegory for sexual assault

1302
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.719
especially following her ongoing
psychological breakdown over the course

1303
01:33:56.719 --> 01:34:01.679
of the plot but as i alluded selena's
duality is indicative of the reality of

1304
01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:07.199
women against the patriarchy's
expectations of what a woman ought to be

1305
01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:12.480
selena herself fails at being a woman in
all respects except for the definition

1306
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.040
of woman that she creates this woman
while dripping in femininity expresses

1307
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.520
that femininity in a way that is neither
meek nor subservient

1308
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.480
but is still
undeniably

1309
01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.760
peak femininity

1310
01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:33.760
i would love to live with you in your
castle i just couldn't live with myself

1311
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.440
demonstrating that womanhood and
powerlessness is an artificial construct

1312
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.639
generated by men to keep half the
population subjugated and thus decrease

1313
01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:49.679
the number of people who can challenge
their power so what happens when a woman

1314
01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:53.920
does challenge their power they kill her
again

1315
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.400
and again
and again

1316
01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.199
even men who are allegedly allies
simply by enforcing the systems of

1317
01:35:01.199 --> 01:35:06.159
justice that enforce her suppression
the male ally in turn

1318
01:35:06.159 --> 01:35:10.880
enforces her suppression without
intending to with gender and gender

1319
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.960
expression being brought to the center
of attention yet obscured by character

1320
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.000
pathos
this is the kind of thing the queer

1321
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.159
audiences read into even if you're just
plain gay you end up doing a whole lot

1322
01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:26.239
more thinking about gender mechanics
simply because we live in a world that

1323
01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:31.600
still precludes gay from various gender
ideals specifically the core of what we

1324
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.960
consider
masculinity so we tune into this the

1325
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.440
reclamation and redefinition of gender
in a way that works for us

1326
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.719
rather than suppresses us and a process
that selena survives to boot

1327
01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:48.080
and these are messages that resonate
with us in a way where pfeiffer's

1328
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.639
catwoman is still regarded as the best
and which any number of drag queens will

1329
01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:56.000
attempt to depict but why does
pfeiffer's catwoman get elevated to a

1330
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.840
pedestal when uma thurman's poison ivy
is forgotten perhaps tragically as i

1331
01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:08.480
told lady freeze when i pulled her plug
this is a one-woman show uma thurman is

1332
01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.880
a phenomenal actress who deserves better
than what she got and deserves more

1333
01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.320
recognition for the work that she's done
joel schumacher's batman films

1334
01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.480
themselves befit an entirely more
shamelessly obvious definition of camp

1335
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.199
than burton's whereas bertens was a
highly stylized depiction linked

1336
01:36:25.199 --> 01:36:28.159
together with the singular artistic
theme

1337
01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:32.639
schumacher's batman is the death becomes
her to burton's whatever happened to

1338
01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:38.159
baby jane which is more than valid
but for most of his two movies nobody

1339
01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:41.280
really has the slightest idea what movie
they're in

1340
01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.159
it's like a collection of movie stars
were pulled together to shove their

1341
01:36:44.159 --> 01:36:48.880
respective brands into the film the
ending result is something so disjointed

1342
01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.920
and chaotic and
absurdly horny that it's hard not to

1343
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.440
find it entertaining at the very least
and uma thurman seems to be the only

1344
01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.199
person who has gay friends because she
knew what was up

1345
01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:05.360
these films unlike the burton versions
were here to primarily sell toys sure

1346
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.159
but artistically the intention was to
present the idea of comic book

1347
01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:15.440
characters because these were not
the comic book characters

1348
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.440
what killed the dinosaurs
they say

1349
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:25.280
monkey business
we've got work to do

1350
01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.119
uma thurman showed up to spill tea in a
body suit her character was constructed

1351
01:37:31.119 --> 01:37:36.400
around a quasi-eco-terrorist vibe with a
heavy overtone of magic dr pamela eisley

1352
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.880
in the comics however is usually
depicted as independent especially of

1353
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.119
male characters in the movie however she
is tied to strong male characters who

1354
01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:51.760
more or less run the show first
gotham

1355
01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.360
and then
the world

1356
01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:00.239
just what i had in mind
in conjunction with being scripted to be

1357
01:38:00.239 --> 01:38:05.040
subservient to a man all the while using
her feminine wiles to manipulate him she

1358
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.480
was also juxtaposed against this
version of batgirl so while thurman's

1359
01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.600
poison ivy was a powerful lady who
served

1360
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.239
she was foiled against the good woman
one who worked with other men and whose

1361
01:38:18.239 --> 01:38:22.000
plot was constructed around learning how
to ask them for permission at the same

1362
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.960
time as doing that girl boss thing but
camp

1363
01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.040
wasn't always destined to be married to
strong feminine archetypes and

1364
01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.360
subversions yes all these films are
remembered in no small part due to the

1365
01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.280
strong queer following and like
schumacher queer creators worked

1366
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.760
tirelessly to project camp aesthetic to
an otherwise naive and innocent straight

1367
01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.560
audience
[Music]

1368
01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.320
because camp was an aesthetic so closely
associated with drag queens and drag

1369
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.719
culture it only made sense that you
would start to get movies about them the

1370
01:38:56.719 --> 01:38:59.920
public was aware that drag queens
existed though

1371
01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.600
usually referred to them as slurs and
having them depicted as anything but

1372
01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.679
punchlines was uncommon and thanks in
part to the early rise to rupaul who

1373
01:39:09.679 --> 01:39:13.199
somehow managed to break out of gay
obscurity and reach a degree of public

1374
01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:17.679
renown there was indeed a public
curiosity about drag queens and two

1375
01:39:17.679 --> 01:39:22.000
movies about drag queens were released
at roughly the same time now the

1376
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.080
adventures of priscilla queen of the
desert hereafter we'll just refer to it

1377
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.719
as priscilla to save time was released
in 1994 in australia three drag queens

1378
01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:34.560
one of them being a trans woman need to
go cross-country to make a career-making

1379
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.719
performance this starts hugo weaving guy
pierce and terence stamp riding on the

titular priscilla the chrome tour bus
that will carry them across the

1381

australian outback the group struggles

1382
01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.239
tension and all kinds of road trip
hijinks however its status as camp is

1383
01:39:52.239 --> 01:39:56.480
somewhat difficult to explain see it's
australian which means it comes from a

1384
01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.719
very different collection of cultural
sensibilities leaning on a bit more of

1385
01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:05.119
what we may consider to be dry british
humor though i struggle to really say

1386
01:40:05.119 --> 01:40:09.199
it's british humor because for those who
have seen shit's creek or other canadian

1387
01:40:09.199 --> 01:40:14.080
comedies it seems like the only former
british colony that doesn't seem to

1388
01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.119
prefer dry comedy is
america dry humor is one where a given

1389
01:40:19.119 --> 01:40:23.440
punch line of a joke is delivered with
less emphasis in a general sense it

1390
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.080
involves far more sarcasm and delivery
and in comedic styles a reaction to the

1391
01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.840
joke is far less important there's no
prompt to let you know when to laugh

1392
01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.360
it's kind of up to the viewer to use
their reasoning to spot when something

1393
01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.360
is funny in order to generate this kind
of comedy one requires a separate

1394
01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.440
in-world state of absurdity all
characters even the straight characters

1395
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.679
have full awareness of the inherent
rules of this world and their comedic

1396
01:40:47.679 --> 01:40:51.199
responses are built around what is
outrageous by these established

1397
01:40:51.199 --> 01:40:55.679
standards this is abundantly clear in
one of the ultimate drag queen camp

1398
01:40:55.679 --> 01:40:59.520
movies
spice world and sensibilities like those

1399
01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.080
demonstrated in spice world are opposed
to more american styles of comedy where

1400
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:08.239
the world is meant to be normal with a
few exceptions like phoebe from friends

1401
01:41:08.239 --> 01:41:12.080
but as another example i was inclined to
include the british series absolutely

1402
01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.800
fabulous this series itself is pivotal
in establishing sensibilities in the

1403
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.400
queer community and gets overlooked for
continuously indicating that one of the

1404
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.080
two primary characters is actually trans
femme without any character having a

1405
01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.600
single problem with it it is simply an
element of the character that is taken

1406
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.719
for granted which feeds from the
generalized style of comedy where

1407
01:41:30.719 --> 01:41:34.000
characters simply don't react to the
comedic antics of other characters

1408
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.520
within the script all individuals take
for granted that this is simply how

1409
01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.920
things are which is the difficulty when
it comes to including international camp

1410
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.119
media
it's played so dry and straight that

1411
01:41:45.119 --> 01:41:48.960
north american audiences often assume
that this is simply how people act in

1412
01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.440
australia and the uk so because the
comedy is downplayed to find the humor

1413
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.440
the viewer must be intimately familiar
with the given culture to know where the

1414
01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.920
separation lies between cultural
absurdity and emotional realism such as

1415
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.400
in priscilla the elder queen cleaning up
the younger one after a gay bashing and

1416
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:09.280
the drama revolving around hugo
weaving's character having a child

1417
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.119
raised by his estranged former wife and
the trans queen falling into a romance

1418
01:42:13.119 --> 01:42:17.520
with a backcountry mechanic they meet by
happenstance to an audience expecting a

1419
01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.080
comedy to be aceventura it's not clear
when the drama ends and the comedy

1420
01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.480
begins leading many to assume it's
simply a slice of australian life the

1421
01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.400
themes of this movie don't necessarily
focus on gender so much as it refocuses

1422
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.239
perhaps shedding the proxy of gender
discourse to develop a discussion about

1423
01:42:34.239 --> 01:42:37.760
queerness as a whole but having an open
discourse about queerness where the

1424
01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.280
messaging of queerness was not directed
to straight people was refreshing and

1425
01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.600
even if they are international actors
they were actors of some renown which is

1426
01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.080
also nice to see actors taking a risk
especially at the time priscilla

1427
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.280
particularly resonates with me because
there's this kind of ending message that

1428
01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.000
says that it's perfectly okay to modify
your life to accommodate being with

1429
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.320
other people that it's okay to lean in
to other people and that nobody should

1430
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.320
really be expected to be entirely
independent not necessarily a queer

1431
01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.400
message but it's nice to hear that we
get so much social pressure to be

1432
01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.719
completely self-sufficient at all these
dumb little adulting things that i feel

1433
01:43:18.719 --> 01:43:22.719
like we don't take as much time as we
should to just let ourselves be human

1434
01:43:22.719 --> 01:43:27.440
priscilla made about 30 million dollars
on a budget of 2 million which with

1435
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.679
hollywood accounting is about 26 million
dollars profit free and clear so when it

1436
01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:36.719
came to hollywood they thought hey
let's see if we can do that tu wangfu

1437
01:43:36.719 --> 01:43:40.159
thanks for everything julie newmar was
actually in development at roughly the

1438
01:43:40.159 --> 01:43:43.760
same time as priscilla once again for
the sake of expediency we'll be

1439
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.199
referring to this as simply to wong vu
granted the length of these titles is

1440
01:43:47.199 --> 01:43:51.040
kind of camp in and of itself and
patrick swayze is marvelous in the lead

1441
01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.679
role but we could have had willem dafoe
instead part of me is a little sad about

1442
01:43:55.679 --> 01:44:00.400
that defoe is under consideration for
the role but apparently swayze as a test

1443
01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.000
went out with the director for a broad
daylight walk around new york in full

1444
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.360
drag
and was unclockable this film another

1445
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.360
road trip features two established
queens noxima jackson played by wesley

1446
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.920
snipes and vita boem played by swayze
bringing a younger queen under their

1447
01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.679
wing chichi rodriguez played by john
leguizamo after winning a trip to

1448
01:44:19.679 --> 01:44:23.600
hollywood to enter into a major drag
competition they pawn the plane tickets

1449
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.920
and use the money to buy a fabulous
convertible coupe de ville to drive to

1450
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.639
la instead the camp here like with
priscilla is featured in how these girls

1451
01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:37.040
opt to do the entire trip in drag the
early section of the film alludes to

1452
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.119
traumatic family life and an attempted
sexual assault by a police officer who

1453
01:44:41.119 --> 01:44:44.719
stops the working girls on the road
without knowing that there were drag

1454
01:44:44.719 --> 01:44:48.880
queens their car breaks down a staple of
all road trip movies and hijinks ensue

1455
01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.159
when the queens have to blend into a
small town as women because they're

1456
01:44:52.159 --> 01:44:56.000
never out of drag apparently chichi
becomes enamored with a local boy who

1457
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.920
believes she's a girl or a sis girl
anyway and the other two queens become

1458
01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.040
frustrated with country living while
they wait for a replacement part for

1459
01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:06.400
their car through the duration of the
movie they work to improve the lives of

1460
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.840
the locals including standing up to the
abusive husband of a woman who befriends

1461
01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.760
the group the cop who had assaulted vida
who is ridiculed by his fellow officers

1462
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.520
for appearing to have been beaten up by
a girl storms over to the town where the

1463
01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.440
queens are hiding and demands their
heads as payment for this humiliation

1464
01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:26.080
the rest of the town comes to their aid
dressed in the poise of drag and chase

1465
01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.480
them off the town has a fabulous weekend
festival and their car is fixed in

1466
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.960
hollywood chichi who had always felt so
insecure about her ability to be a drag

1467
01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.800
queen is the winner of the competition
now while this movie like priscilla

1468
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.679
leans on camp comedy this is quite toned
down from what you would get from diva

1469
01:45:43.679 --> 01:45:48.080
centric examples like death becomes her
and elvira mistress of the dark it's

1470
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.320
there but they don't lean into it as
much and this isn't to say that gay

1471
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.440
movies didn't do camp john waters has an
entire pre-hairspray filmography which i

1472
01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.280
omitted because talking about it's gonna
have to have its own video instead of

1473
01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.360
serving up shameless camp i feel like
the filmmakers here were using the

1474
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.280
platform to work in some legitimate
feelings and spread awareness which was

1475
01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.280
an ongoing theme of what became a weird
glut of movies about gay people from the

1476
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:19.360
1990s and 2000s kiss me guido mambo
italiano in and out edges 17 etc but the

1477
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.040
90s as a whole had a cultural aesthetic
of taking things that were not meant to

1478
01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:28.080
be serious and making them serious or
using frivolous framing devices to talk

1479
01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.119
about things that were

1480
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:37.440
very serious
[Music]

1481
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.119
now to close out we are going to briefly
talk about but i'm a cheerleader so

1482
01:46:41.119 --> 01:46:44.880
trigger warning for those who need it
this is one of the quintessential films

1483
01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.000
about conversion therapy but i'm a
cheerleader follows the story of

1484
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.760
fictional character megan plumfield i
specify that the character is fictional

1485
01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.199
because the more you know about how
conversion therapy works

1486
01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:59.199
the more this feels like a horror movie
because literally everything in this

1487
01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:03.199
movie is lifted directly from the
practices of conversion therapists also

1488
01:47:03.199 --> 01:47:08.159
known as sadists unaware that she is a
lesbian she's outed to herself by her

1489
01:47:08.159 --> 01:47:12.560
family and then shipped off to a
conversion therapy camp the line but i'm

1490
01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.119
a cheerleader is used by megan as a
defense for her presumed heterosexuality

1491
01:47:17.119 --> 01:47:22.239
the argument here being that she cannot
be a lesbian because she conforms to

1492
01:47:22.239 --> 01:47:26.480
typical feminine stereotypes megan
becomes trapped in a secluded location

1493
01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.400
with a collection of other gay and queer
people who are out to beat the gay out

1494
01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.960
of them sometimes literally if needed
they are put through a series of

1495
01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.880
heterosexualizing activities
and often separated by gender the girls

1496
01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.600
are pushed towards home economics
cooking cleaning and feminine things in

1497
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.600
the hopes that it will overwrite their
homosexual desires with the proper

1498
01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.360
heteronormative ones again given that
megan is a cheerleader and very

1499
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.679
effeminate in her own right these are
not things that she is necessarily

1500
01:47:57.679 --> 01:48:01.679
uncomfortable with the boys by contrast
are forbidden from cooking and cleaning

1501
01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:06.000
instead they do manly things like
landscaping and simulated war games i

1502
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.360
mean
when it comes to america's weird take on

1503
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.560
like
conversion therapy rituals preventing

1504
01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.760
boys from any kind of cooking is
ridiculous like it's almost

1505
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.800
contradictory because hot cuisine is an
industry dominated by men and i don't

1506
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.560
really want to get into analyzing the
logic of people who isolate a few

1507
01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.679
passages from the bible as the
foundation and basis of their entire

1508
01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:33.040
world view but the line between boy
things and girl things has been erased

1509
01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.360
and redrawn throughout history more
times than you can fathom

1510
01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.520
heels
introduced to europe as footwear for men

1511
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.360
so that men would always be distinctly
taller than women gender

1512
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.560
it's a thing
sometimes anyway megan meets a girl

1513
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.400
graham as one does at one of these
locations and it's heavily implied that

1514
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.400
these girls would make very good
roommates but now we're getting into the

1515
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.080
territory of why a girl like graham who
is comfortable in her sexuality would

1516
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.760
allow herself to go through this
humiliating process as is normally the

1517
01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:08.400
case it's an ultimatum put upon kids by
their family and the risk is being cast

1518
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.280
out entirely because that's what jesus
would do apparently very plain to see

1519
01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.480
why the american version of jesus was
not included in neil gaiman's american

1520
01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.560
gods and it's also not like the
conversion process only uses

1521
01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.639
constructive processes to mold and shape
gender roles and identities there are no

1522
01:49:24.639 --> 01:49:28.800
walls in their dorm rooms for a reason
no masturbation at night permitted and

1523
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.599
if an attendee experiences any impure
thoughts they are encouraged to shock

1524
01:49:33.599 --> 01:49:37.840
themselves when caught making out late
at night two boys are reprimanded one

1525
01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.840
runs away the other is kept back and
isolated from the rest of the group

1526
01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.080
forced to sleep in a dog house the one
who ran away is rescued by two former

1527
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.679
attendees of the camp who then take
megan and graham to a gay bar where

1528
01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:54.000
megan begins to feel more comfortable
with herself and who she is away from

1529
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.239
the confines of heterosexual society
however when she's caught by the camp

1530
01:49:58.239 --> 01:50:02.320
she's forced to leave with graham
staying behind megan is rescued by the

1531
01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:06.400
ex-ex-gay men and they plan a coup to
rescue the kids before their

1532
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:11.520
heterosexual graduation meanwhile back
at the camp the gendering rituals become

1533
01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.040
more humiliating
forcing boys and girls to wear skin

1534
01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.560
suits with fig leaves covering the
impure parts

1535
01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:23.119
they simulate heterosexual intercourse
these

1536
01:50:23.119 --> 01:50:26.880
proper christians
are forcing minors to engage in these

1537
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.480
rituals
and yet we still let them call

1538
01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.280
themselves christians
let alone good people maybe this is just

1539
01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.440
a catholic in me but i was under the
impression that literally only god or

1540
01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:42.719
jesus or saint peter had the authority
to dictate

1541
01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:47.040
who was or was not going to hell and
therefore making the decision that

1542
01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.880
another human being for committing
whatever action is going to hell is

1543
01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:56.719
speaking in the stead of the divine
figure and thus is technically heresy

1544
01:50:56.719 --> 01:51:00.159
which does sin due to hell but we don't
need to get into theology right now

1545
01:51:00.159 --> 01:51:03.840
anyway the day is saved the boys get to
love boys and graham runs away with

1546
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.360
megan protected by the nice gay men in
their youth shelter the movie ends with

1547
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.199
megan's parents attending a pflag
meeting so

1548
01:51:11.199 --> 01:51:14.719
things are looking up now while some of
you especially those who have lived

1549
01:51:14.719 --> 01:51:18.159
through experiences like this may take
issue with how much of this content was

1550
01:51:18.159 --> 01:51:22.880
depicted frivolously the ridiculous
gender rituals were depicted for laughs

1551
01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:26.719
which is valid if it was depicted as a
psychological thriller

1552
01:51:26.719 --> 01:51:29.599
it would automatically lose a chunk of
the audience

1553
01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:33.360
it's simply easier to spread this
message around if it's showcased as

1554
01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.119
something lighthearted essentially trick
people into misunderstanding how grave

1555
01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:43.920
this subject matter is until the very
end anyway camp was used as a means to

1556
01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:49.920
give this movie gay appeal beyond simply
being a story about our experiences but

1557
01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:53.840
also to add a lighthearted angle for
straight people who needed to be

1558
01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:57.520
massaged into this knowledge but even
then

1559
01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.800
with this movie and the drag queen road
trips

1560
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.760
we see camp deployed as an aesthetic and
camp sensibilities arising specifically

1561
01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.560
where there is discourse about gender
however the camp itself is toned down

1562
01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.880
once again in lieu of realism for the
sake of representation camp is used as a

1563
01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:17.920
sensibility to highlight the gender
discourse

1564
01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.320
but the discourse itself
was one that was meant to be seen when

1565
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:27.040
it comes to all about eve it seems to be
a discourse about fame and corruption on

1566
01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.599
the surface whereas given the minutia of
the script it's really about the role of

1567
01:52:31.599 --> 01:52:35.280
women in show business and the options
that women in show business are given as

1568
01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.880
they age the adventures of julie newmar
the baby's afraid of a cheerleader i

1569
01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:43.119
mean sorry camp although i totally see
that movie the thing about camp in the

1570
01:52:43.119 --> 01:52:47.679
end is that it's oddly ageless comedy is
the fastest to age and the most likely

1571
01:52:47.679 --> 01:52:52.320
to age badly but the extremes of camp
leave it fresh for generations to come

1572
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:59.599
the absurdity is a preservative
[Music]

1573
01:52:59.599 --> 01:53:02.960
it wasn't long before the entertainment
industry as a whole

1574
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:08.400
recognized the power of camp not just as
a way to covertly bring in queer

1575
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.040
audiences without actually showing queer
characters but as a way to bring in all

1576
01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.760
audiences
you see

1577
01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.920
camp can be
very all-inclusive if you choose to let

1578
01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:23.840
it be the hyper-masculinity of the works
of directors like michael bay and zack

1579
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:29.280
snyder are just as campy as a busload of
drag queens just pushed in the opposite

1580
01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.679
extreme instead of making a farce out of
the femininity they make a farce of the

1581
01:53:33.679 --> 01:53:37.360
masculinity whether the director is
intended to or not the glistening

1582
01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:41.440
muscles of 300 spartans lovingly
depicted in slow motion for maximum

1583
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:45.440
impact led to posters for that movie
adorning the walls of just as many gay

1584
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.639
boys as straight boys when it first came
out the sequel was even supposed to

1585
01:53:48.639 --> 01:53:53.040
feature a gay couple which snyder fought
for but was overruled by the studio at

1586
01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.040
which point he left the project the
sequel instead features lena hedy in the

1587
01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:01.679
scene-stealing role of queen gorgo
a badass powerful woman ripped from the

1588
01:54:01.679 --> 01:54:06.080
mind of john waters and planted into a
homoerotic greek epic i'd argue that

1589
01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:10.159
this is another drag queen role that's
played by a woman and while hollywood

1590
01:54:10.159 --> 01:54:14.320
was accidentally turning male power
fantasies into peak camp cinema

1591
01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.800
knowing filmmakers were bringing camp
into the mainstream the over-the-top

1592
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.960
caricature of an aged actress played by
catherine o'hara in shit's creek

1593
01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.119
knowingly took the absurdity of faye
dunaway's joan crawford and turned it up

1594
01:54:27.119 --> 01:54:32.000
to an 11 and then broke the dial off
moira rose former soap opera starlet

1595
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.639
seems to exist in a reality in which the
golden age of hollywood never ended even

1596
01:54:36.639 --> 01:54:40.639
as she lives in a run-down motel
clutching onto her fabulous wigs and

1597
01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:45.679
outfits for some comfort in the chaotic
world of normalcy but this knowing camp

1598
01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:50.960
character earned o'hara an emmy for her
career defining performance whereas

1599
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.040
it earned dunaway or razzie decades
before though nobody would argue that

1600
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.400
moira and joan are the same kind of
character

1601
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.480
the same kind of performance is given
the difference being that o'hara knows

1602
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.719
how far she's pushing it and then keeps
pushing at the right moments but brings

1603
01:55:06.719 --> 01:55:10.560
it back in when needed
creating a camp character you wish you

1604
01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.599
could be friends with
instead of one

1605
01:55:13.599 --> 01:55:18.159
you'd flee from and of course there's
rupaul's drag race now in its 144th

1606
01:55:18.159 --> 01:55:21.920
season taking every possible aspect of a
camp's sensibility and making it

1607
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.400
mainstream drag queens who were once the
camp idols drawing crowds at gay bars

1608
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.320
are now filling stadiums as the
absurdity of a man dressing as joan

1609
01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:35.119
crawford becomes
not so absurd camp has always had a

1610
01:55:35.119 --> 01:55:39.440
loving cisgender heterosexual audience
who either discovered it through queer

1611
01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.360
friends or just happened to be heteros
with taste here on youtube cold crash

1612

classics than i ever have and he's got a

1613
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.080
girlfriend even anime has embraced camp
the intense masculinity of shows like

1614
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.239
dragon ball z with the glistening abs
and queer-coated villains has an

1615
01:55:56.239 --> 01:56:00.639
unintentional camp factor ed wood would
cream their pants over and do not even

1616
01:56:00.639 --> 01:56:04.000
attempt to tell me that jojo's bizarre
adventure isn't one of the campiest

1617
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.239
things ever created in fact one could
argue that camp is the primary aspect

1618
01:56:08.239 --> 01:56:12.239
that gives jojo's bizarre adventure its
primary fandom in susan sontag's

1619
01:56:12.239 --> 01:56:16.639
defining essay on camp she explains that
camp is a sensibility a mode of

1620
01:56:16.639 --> 01:56:20.560
aestheticism a private code a badge of
identity

1621
01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:24.880
the hallmark of camp she says is the
spirit of extravagance

1622
01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.840
it can be broad but not everything can
be camp here i disagree

1623
01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.880
because everything can be camp
if it tries hard enough and that i think

1624
01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.560
is my definition of camp
trying hard enough

1625
01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.760
putting your all into something that
others would expect little from seeing

1626
01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.159
where the limits lie and then stepping
over them enjoying your exuberant love

1627
01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:50.800
of something instead of hiding it the
brilliant cattiness of all about eve the

1628
01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.840
venomous shade of who's afraid of
virginia woolf

1629
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:57.360
the fabulous bitchiness of death becomes
her

1630
01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.920
the beautiful absurdity of drag queen
road trips the weaponized feminism of

1631
01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.000
pfeiffer's catwoman
the voluptuous feathers and blinding

1632
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.760
sequins of elton john the living art
projects of david bowie the boundless

1633
01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.400
genre-defying queer energy of freddie
mercury

1634
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:19.360
and even the glistening muscles of 300
spartans and anime supermen it's all

1635
01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.440
camp
it's all more than just a little queer

1636
01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:26.800
and it's all us
we queers not so secretly define the

1637
01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.119
culture we live in no matter what the
straits think so this june of 2022 pride

1640
01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:42.960
entries in this list i hope you make
some time for movie marathons by all

1641
01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:47.040
means watch the movies on this list but
there are so many other movies and shows

1642
01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.880
that i haven't even mentioned here these
are the cultural milestones that have

1643
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:55.599
helped shape queer culture
and have helped us endure persecution

1644
01:57:55.599 --> 01:57:59.119
and scrutiny when the politicians and
the zealots and the turfs and the

1645
01:57:59.119 --> 01:58:04.560
homophobes and the hate mongers come for
us and push us out the proverbial window

1646
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.320
we just keep getting up
we've got more than nine lives we've got

1647
01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:14.239
hundreds thousands millions we survived
the trauma of our own mommy dearests

1648
01:58:14.239 --> 01:58:18.239
and drank the potion of immortality so
we're going to be around forever no

1649
01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:22.639
matter how many eve harringtons try to
steal our luster no matter how many

1650
01:58:22.639 --> 01:58:27.440
small towns try to burn us at the stake
no matter how many fiends try to murder

1651
01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.040
us with a candlestick in the library
we're not going anywhere hell we can

1652
01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:38.000
take over the whole damn world
because if camp has taught us anything

1653
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.520
it's how to make the absurd
into reality
