00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.880
I never knew I was into shipping as 
much as I apparently am until I, well,  

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.720
found out what shipping was. My whole life I’d 
been shipping characters with one another because,  

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.760
as a gay kid, how the hell else was I 
supposed to have gay characters in anything?  

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.640
The Ryan Murphy-verse was a good two decades 
away so gay characters in movies and tv  

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
were pretty damn rare. Unless they were 
dying of aids or a coded serial killer.

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920
So instead, my innocent little brain turned 
elsewhere for gay relationships. Funnily enough,  

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.680
as someone who’s said multiple times over the 
past couple of years that I was never that  

8
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.520
big a fan of anime, my first big ships came from 
anime. Namely Gohan and Trunks from DragonBall Z  

9
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.760
(yes, I know there’s a problematic age difference 
but there’s also time travel so leave me alone),  

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.280
as well as Heero and Duo, and 
Trowa and Qautre from Gundam Wing.  

11
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.200
And who can forget my first rivals to 
boyfriends pairing, Matt and Tai from Digimon.

12
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.040
Never once in any of these series 
are any of these characters even  

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.080
hinted at being gay. But did I 
care? Hell no. They were in love,  

14
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
and you were not going to tell my prepubescent 
brain otherwise. Especially Matt and Tai.

15
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.040
That was a ship that could weather any storm.

16
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.280
It got a lot easier when Queer as Folk came 
on TV and the gay pairings were made obvious.

17
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.720
Around the time Queer as Folk started 
airing I also started watching more  

18
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.000
“adult” media. Deciding wholeheartedly that I was 
going to go to film school, I started watching the  

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.640
classics. Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Whose 
Afraid of Viginia Woolf, The Boys in the Sand.  

20
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.120
You know, real proper cinema. Not 
those silly cartoons from Japan.

21
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.520
And then after finishing film school I spent 
another decade married to the idea that I was too  

22
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.800
good for anything but the best of cinema (becoming 
a huge David Fincher stan in the process).  

23
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.800
And then, accidentally, I was exposed to the 
torid world of shipping once again. When I,  

24
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.640
despite not having seen any other MCU movies, went 
to see Captain America on opening night. Because,  

25
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.200
you know, Chris Evans.

26
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.320
And I left that theatre absolutely, utterly, 
convinced that Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were  

27
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.520
in love. It was so clear! Steve flew a plane into 
an arctic ice-cap instead of being with a woman,  

28
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.240
but tried everything to save Bucky. It 
had to be true! It was so obvious. There  

29
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.680
must be other people on the internet 
seeing the same way that I was feeling.

30
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.040
And there was. And they’d even seen gay 
relationships in media I hadn’t read into!

31
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520
Oh my god, you’re right! 
Sherlock is totally queer!

32
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
Remus and Sirius? Of course! Sirius, 
The confirmed bachelor, and Remus,  

33
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.920
the guy who didnt even contemplate 
being with a girl until Sirius was dead.

34
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.880
Xena and Gabrielle. How the hell had I 
never seen that before?! Was I blind?!

35
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.480
There were so many examples, and whole mythologies 
worth of fan fiction, or slash fiction,  

36
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.600
describing how these couples worked. I 
even spotted some Matt and Tai stuff.

37
00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:03.840
So yeah, I found out that shipping was 
a thing. Never been the same since.

38
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.440
One thing that they will not, under 
any circumstances, teach you in college  

39
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280
is that we owe the bulk of 
humanity’s literature to plagiarism.  

40
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.040
Heracles was a pan-hellenic hero who was the 
focus and topic of plays and poems for the  

41
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.440
duration of ancient Greece, but also throughout 
Rome. And then kind of moved into being this  

42
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.320
point of reference for heroic stories in 
the Middle Ages of Europe and Byzantium.

43
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.920
It’s unlikely that whoever was the first to write 
about Heracles was the only one developing content  

44
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.320
about the character in their own lifetime. But 
in ancient cultures, they also didn’t hold the  

45
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.120
same values about intellectual property 
as we do now. Because there was no central  

46
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.480
institution about owning copyright, they did not 
really believe that one could own a character.

47
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.240
Especially when a core component 
of Heracles is that he is the son  

48
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.040
of Zeus. Zeus, who was the chief deity of a 
religion. It would be like Disney making a story  

49
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.920
about Jesus’s bumbling younger brother, Bob. And 
then trying to copyright “Jesus” as a character.

50
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.040
Keep in mind, Disney is the same company that 
tried to file copyright claims on ‘Odin,’  

51
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.080
‘Loki’ and ‘Thor.’ Because, yes, they have 
several movies featuring characters of those names  

52
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.440
who draw influence from the Norse pantheon. 
However, in copyright law, there would not  

53
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.400
be a clear way to distinguish the ‘Odin’ in 
Disney movies from the ‘Odin’ of mythology.

54
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.400
In writing, at least. Because Marvel’s Odin has a 
look. But when copyrighting the name itself, that  

55
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.520
could get messy. Because… Odin is still openly 
revered in parts of the world — namely Iceland.  

56
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.320
Norse beliefs are still openly 
practised, and what happens when  

57
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.560
you pay homage to a god whose likeness 
is owned by an American media monopoly?

58
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.960
To say nothing of Wagner’s Ring Cycle and 
other prominent media about Norse Mythology.  

59
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.920
Would Disney own copyright on those characters? 
Also the fact that Marvel’s Odin is based on a  

60
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.560
comic book character which was created in the 
1960s by Stan Lee, who passed away recently.  

61
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.400
Indicating that… ownership of the comic book 
Thor… is not necessarily ownership of Movie Thor…

62
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.520
Which brings to me a question 
of… when — or how — movie Thor  

63
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.800
could ever pass into public domain? Will he 
enter public domain at the same time as Comic  

64
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.840
book Thor? And like… given that they’re all based 
on characters who were already in public domain…

65
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.240
See — Jack Kirby got around this problem by  

66
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.520
making all the Eternals’ names slightly 
different than their modern spellings.

67
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.000
—————

68
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.400
ETERNALS   — Thena: “It’s 
just ‘Thena.’ Drop the A.”

69
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.040
—————

70
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.320
But in the antiquated world, they didn’t 
even bother with these hang-ups. Using  

71
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.800
another creator’s creations was seen as a kind 
of reverence to the original poet, playwright,  

72
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.400
or bard. In fact, even writing under their name 
was seen as an homage — for instance, there’s  

73
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.800
some scholarly debate if the Odyssey was written 
by Homer, or if it was written after his death.

74
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.480
But the fact that we, in our modern society, do 
have copyright laws should automatically signal  

75
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.520
just how natural it seems to us to simply 
appropriate existing fiction into new fiction.  

76
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.840
Though the phrase is mistakenly associated 
with Picasso, the phrase ‘Good artists create;  

77
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.320
Great artists steal’ seems to be the lynchpin 
that literary traditions have been built off of.

78
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.360
Every great Greek and Roman play was 
constructed on a mythological cycle  

79
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.240
that had existed for centuries prior. 
The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost,  

80
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.200
were both built off of 
Christian myth and folklore.

81
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.400
So yes… as most of literature exists because 
it was, as it would be considered now,  

82
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.520
a kind of fan-fiction — shipping, by 
extension, is also a valid method of  

83
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.280
narrative creation. Half of Greek myth is 
shipping. Pairing off different Gods, Kings,  

84
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.040
Heroes, and Deities together is the backbone of 
the mythological cycle. It’s how Gods like Pan,  

85
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.000
Zagreus, and even Aphrodite have 
uncertain or conflicting parentage.

86
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.640
In our society, perhaps more so out 
of a need to categorise everything and  

87
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.640
less out of respect, we consider 
the creator to be the authority on  

88
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.200
a creation, even after they’re long dead 
and their creations are used by the masses.  

89
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.440
As an example: it doesn’t really matter which 
version of Sherlock Holmes we’re observing,  

90
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.000
we generally default to Sir Aurther Conan 
Doyle as the authority on the figure,  

91
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.600
in a way we do not generally attribute creative 
licences made by Stephen Moffat as ‘canonical.’

92
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.040
So in a classical context, there was little to 
no friction when using other writers’ characters.  

93
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.680
In part, because most of the 
characters worth referencing  

94
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.880
had been created hundreds if 
not thousands of years before.

95
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.800
But in a modern context, you know. Copyright 
— for better and for worse. I mean, I think  

96
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.480
there’s a lot of ways that copyright does 
protect creators, but there are ways that  

97
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.120
corporations and well-known, fabulously 
wealthy creators abuse it. Given that  

98
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.920
media awareness has shifted from the classics 
to contemporary characters, if you want to  

99
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.240
write about characters that already exist, as 
the vast majority of writers in history have,  

100
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.320
these days, you are probably writing about 
characters that are protected by copyright.

101
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.040
Which even though all that usually means is that 
you can’t make money off of what you’re writing,  

102
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.040
that really doesn’t seem to deter people. Popular 
fanfiction websites like Archive of Our Own get a  

103
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.720
dizzying amount of content every 
day. If ever there was an argument  

104
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.560
against people acting exclusively 
for profit it would be fanfiction.

105
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.200
One of the most popular forms of which is taking 
central characters and putting them in romantic  

106
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.120
entanglements with either characters in the 
plot with whom they shared good chemistry,  

107
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.440
or inventing entirely new characters.

108
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.200
This is what is referred to as 
‘shipping.’ As per a relation-ship.

109
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.040
These are non-canonical relationships 
that make up the bulk of fanfiction now,  

110
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.000
and throughout literature. It can be 
argued that all fanfiction is, in some way  

111
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.560
‘shipping.’ Because fanfiction changes the way 
in which characters interact with each-other.

112
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.600
And even though there’s a kind of literary 
stigma against fanfiction in general,  

113
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.320
though specifically shipping, there are 
elements of society that can find a use for it.  

114
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.480
YOU may not be able to get paid 
for your ships and fan fiction,  

115
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.040
but that shouldn’t suggest that there 
isn’t money to be made off of it somehow.

116
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.840
It’s just a question of who 
gets that money and how.

117
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.120
Though shipping has its roots in 
antiquity, there is a somewhat  

118
00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.160
concrete instance for when it shifted into 
the modern world. And it was actually earlier  

119
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.080
than most people would expect — Kirk and 
Spock from the original star trek series.

120
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.680
This was a unique instance of 
shipping for several reasons,  

121
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.560
though namely the fact that it was not a ship 
that was done with characters in public domain.  

122
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.520
This was based around contemporary characters 
whose personalities and plots were unfolding over  

123
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.120
three seasons. Fans had something 
new and tangible to cling on to,  

124
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.760
with promises of new material to come that 
would further enrich the fictional romance.

125
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.400
And, for those in the 60s and even today,  

126
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.360
the romantic and/or sexual tension 
between Kirk and Spock was palpable.

127
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.240
It may not be right to say that it was the 
first ship in a given fandom. There may  

128
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.640
have been local book clubs which chose to read 
into the companionship between Sam and Frodo,  

129
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.680
for instance. However, Star Trek was one 
of the first fictional properties to host  

130
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.200
significantly large conventions 
for the fandom at large.

131
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.080
The open-venue atmosphere generated a place 
to find like-minded niches within the fandom,  

132
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.760
which, itself, was niche. Finding queer or 
queer-friendly fans who openly read into latent,  

133
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.080
perhaps unintentional queerness 
was easier than it had ever been.

134
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.080
So in an era before the internet, 
developing these physical spaces was  

135
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.360
necessary for developing fan theories and having 
head-cannon spread throughout the entire fanbase.

136
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.480
Head-cannon, for reference, is an element of 
the story that, while not confirmed or able  

137
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.320
to be confirmed by the creator, is a theory, or a 
story that the majority of a fanbase has accepted.

138
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.040
For more on the Star Trek shipping phenomen 
check out Jessie Gender’s video linked below.

139
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.120
So how do we go from fans filling in the 
blanks in a fictitious social-utopia — to  

140
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.040
me having very conflicting gay thoughts 
about a popular anime about skateboarding?  

141
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.640
One that leans on a shonan aesthetic 
for extra flavour, but owing most  

142
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.760
of it’s popularity to multiple ambiguously 
obvious queer relationships. And a cat boy.

143
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.240
This is the future progressives are giving you.

144
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.400
Sk8 The Infinity is a 2021 
Anime directed by Hikoro Utsumi,  

145
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:03.120
the director of similarly queer baited and shipped 
anime Free! and Banana Fish. Sk8 tells the story  

146
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.640
of Reki, a Japanese teenager obsessed with 
skateboarding, and Langa, a Japanese Canadian  

147
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.240
who used to be a championship snowboarder 
until the death of his father. The pair meet  

148
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.400
up and Langa discovers that skateboarding 
isn’t that different from snowboarding!

149
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.840
It actually is but let’s go with it.

150
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.960
Together they start attending underground 
skateboarding tournaments called S,  

151
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.920
organised by Adam, an embezzling 
businessman in Digimon villain drag.

152
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.400
In an oddly generous offering of gay ships, 
Sk8 serves up not one by three potential gay  

153
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.280
pairings for fans to write and create art about. 
First up we’ve got the main pair Reki and Langa.

154
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.440
While it all began at least 
sort of casually - they were  

155
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.920
classmates before becoming friends – their 
relationship eventually grew into some more…  

156
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.520
close. Something more close — let’s go 
with close. However, fans immediately  

157
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.400
started seeing a lot of the hints that Reki and 
Langa might wind up as more than just friends,  

158
00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.320
but this never officially happened, of course, 
leaving the fans no choice but to ship them.

159
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.240
Next up we’ve got Joe and Cherry, or as 
they’re fondly known online: Cherry Blossom,  

160
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.520
or matchablossom. These two appear to be a real 
couple in every way, yet they refuse to admit it.

161
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.400
It’s beyond easy to read into the 
idea that these two were once an item,  

162
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.040
broke up, and now simultaneously 
love and hate each other.  

163
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.520
But mostly love. They bicker like a married 
couple, act as surrogate parents to our  

164
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.760
younger group of skaters, and have a tumultuous 
past relationship with Myotismon over here.

165
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.440
Speaking of Adam. He’s a part of the 
third ship in the series along with  

166
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.960
his personal assistant, Tadashi. 
A pairing the internet has named…  

167
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.800
LoveDog. If you’ve seen the show you know why. 
This is… a problematic yet obvious ship. It’s  

168
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.320
clear that these two have some kind of 
relationship beyond official duties, but  

169
00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.720
goddamn it’s abusive! I’ve already made three 
videos about abusive gay relationships in media so  

170
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.880
I’m not going to go into the gritty details. But 
there is some hardcore gaslighting going on here.

171
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.000
But let’s focus on our main 
pair. Reki and Langa. Since  

172
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.920
they’re the whole reason I’m making this video.

173
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.120
Throughout the series these two are given 
multiple moments scientifically designed  

174
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.320
to urge on the potential shippers. Whether it’s 
Reki teaching Langa how to skateboard in a really  

175
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.240
cute montage, or Langa’s now notorious 
“Reki, my love (of skateboarding)” line.

176
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.240
As the series progresses Reki becomes 
more and more a cheerleader of Langa,  

177
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.040
ever more enthusiastic, even though 
Langa is much more reserved and shy.  

178
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.600
Until the final episode when he excitedly 
jumps into Reki’s arms after winning a race.

179
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.760
The pair even play out a typical 
rom-com break up scenario as the show  

180
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.440
crests into the third act. But don’t worry 
they get back together. That’s when they  

181
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:55.520
create a special fist bump that, YOU KNOW, 
if one of them was a girl that damn fist  

182
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.560
bump woulda been a kiss. It’s their way 
of kissing. Am I the only one seeing—

183
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.800
This is also when Langa realises how 
important their friendship is and tells Reki,  

184
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.760
“Let’s do it. I want to 
skate infinitely with you.”

185
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.480
(Blank stare)
“That sounded like a marriage proposal”

186
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.600
So on one hand Sk8 the Infinity has a very 
simple, if not entirely unremarkable plot.  

187
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.840
It’s a typical rookie-makes-the-big-leagues 
narrative. You can pretty much assume the broad  

188
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.840
strokes and outcomes of almost every set-up. 
It’s the relationships that make it stand out.

189
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.560
Sk8 shines in the grace notes and nuances 
that build the story. What’s really meant  

190
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.960
to be entertaining, animation aside, are 
the colourful characters, sardonic comedy,  

191
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.600
wild antics, a couple of neurodivergent characters 
who find a peer group that accepts them (which is  

192
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.040
one of the more touching elements 
of the story, actually) and,  

193
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.600
the adorable boys being boys and doing 
boy things. Very… heterosexual boy things.

194
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.000
Oh look a catboy.

195
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.280
And, in spite of what issues 
with the show that I bring up,  

196
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.200
my opinion of it remains 
net-positive… Conditionally.

197
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.360
The series doesn’t seem entirely sure whether 
it wants to conform to rookie-narrative tropes  

198
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.320
or subvert them. A lot of the time the 
show wants to push an emotional moment  

199
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.920
for the sake of driving characters' pathos. 
But then usually will turn right around  

200
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.360
and break the in-universe rules 
about how fast skateboards can go.

201
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.480
But this is forgivable because 
when it comes to this anime,  

202
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.800
actual skateboarding is ironically one of the 
last things you’re meant to pay attention to.

203
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.800
Another difficulty the show tends to have 
is saying one thing in spoken dialogue,  

204
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.640
but completely rebutting that 
message with visuals and plot beats.  

205
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.880
While on one hand Reki’s personal narrative is 
partly about him coming to terms with the fact  

206
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.160
that he doesn’t need to be the best skateboarder. 
That he has value on and off of the track.

207
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.120
On the other hand Reki is given this pep-talk by 
a character — the owner of a skate shop — who is…  

208
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.720
basically not in the plot. And then immediately 
after that, Reki decides he wants to  

209
00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:00.240
skateboard-race Adam, who, in a prior race, served 
him a broken arm and a molestation allegory.  

210
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.520
Trauma which was there to 
drive interpersonal drama,  

211
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.320
but then disappeared when it was 
no longer convenient to the plot.

212
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.560
This has some really dodgy subtext when it comes 
to villains. But this — this isn’t that video.  

213
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.480
This video is about the subtext you’re 
meant to read into. The shipping.

214
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.920
Turns out the shonen anime’s take on the 
Japanese skateboarding is that everybody’s gay.

215
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.880
“HEY BITCHES, BROS, AND NONBINARY HOES.”

216
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.240
Like… if you’re going to make the villain 
woke and awesome at the same time, can we  

217
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.800
ease off the assault and battery against minors? 
And the… creepy obsession he has with teenagers?

218
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.720
I really wanted to LIKE him but 
like… it’s just so uncomfortable.

219
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.560
But right, the non-problematic couple.

220
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.280
There’s an entire industry of buzz built around 
the ways in which these homo-ambiguous teenagers  

221
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.280
are almost a gay couple. Articles on websites as 
disparate as CBR.com, Kotoku, and The Advocate.  

222
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.080
And the fervour of this community on 
twitter, reddit, and fan-discords may  

223
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.880
very well be a pivotal reason why this show 
has risen to the kind of popularity it has.

224
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.920
There’s even a two night 
stage show for god’s sake.  

225
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.240
That I really wanna see. COVID, can 
you go away I really wanna see that.

226
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.640
This media knows you’re going to ship these 
characters… in fact, it seems to be expected.  

227
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.800
We, the audience, are expected 
to read into the suggested ship,  

228
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.280
to draw fan art, to write fan fiction, to 
engage in an entire constructed community  

229
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.080
around how these two characters would 
interact if the ship was cannon.

230
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.840
And how… do we feel about that?

231
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.080
Why couldn’t we just get the gay sk8er boys? 
Why couldn’t we get the gay sk8er dads?  

232
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.800
It seems clear that not only does the audience 
want this, but that the studio knows this and  

233
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.960
wants to play to that audience. If 
everyone wants it… why hold back?

234
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.680
What’s the rationale? What’s the reason? It seems 
that the queerness is being deliberately withheald  

235
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.520
where it would otherwise fit into 
the plot. And if this is deliberate,  

236
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.440
then we can gauge the ethical 
merits of the situation.

237
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.120
Really… Sk8 doesn’t seem like the kind of series 
that would spurr on an hour long discussion about  

238
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.480
ethics of representation. But as much as the 
writing does seem to be on the wall about gay  

239
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:19.920
coupling in this show, it is — once again 
— a big load of ‘almost’ representation.

240
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:27.120
And the show goes pretty far to ‘almost’ show gay 
romance. But it’s that last ten yards that we’re  

241
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.320
not crossing for some reason. So what’s stopping 
media like this from making the final step?

242
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.400
My theory is that shipping is a 
component of audience engagement  

243
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:43.520
that is filling in for something that 
mass media has lost: merchandising.

244
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.120
Seeing how merchandising and boys’ love (or 
more commonly known as BL because it sounds  

245
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.160
less creepy) are both things that saw great 
advancement within Japanese media in the 1990s,  

246
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.160
it’s probably best to start there.

247
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.680
There had been times when Anime had broken into 
American Airwaves, like Astro Boy, Speed Racer,  

248
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.680
Simba (i mean Kimba), and Sailor Moon. And anime 
from the 80s like Akira have been incredibly  

249
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:12.320
influential in modern Hollywood. However, among 
consumer masses, nothing hit quite like Pokémon.

250
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.480
It used to be that cartoons made for kids were 
created solely as 20 minute commercials to sell  

251
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.440
you toys. Like with the transformers series. 
For a couple years Transformers dominated toy  

252
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.960
shelves and Television. It was Pokémon 
before Pokémon. But Pokémon… has been  

253
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.240
around for twenty years. So has Transformers — 
longer, actually — but Pokémon never went away.

254
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.600
Pokémon was a game-changer, not 
only because it was an anime  

255
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.760
tie-in to a video game that was already 
popular, but it was incredibly toyetic.  

256
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.200
And being able to make toys from characters, 
creatures, and objects in a piece of visual  

257
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.920
media is something that American companies had 
proven to be cash cows before. Look at Star Wars.

258
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.800
With this merchandising angle, a producer 
can double or even quintuple income by  

259
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.440
constructing an ongoing series in a way 
where the plot is intrinsically tied  

260
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.920
to something that can very 
easily be made into a toy.  

261
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.720
Especially when you have a way to 
refresh the toy line every few years.

262
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.920
But where Pokémon was more successful... is how 
characters were so simple and so recognizable  

263
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.360
that you can stick them on a T-shirt and everyone 
will know its Pikachu. Whereas, to the layman,  

264
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.440
Starscream and Megatron might not be 
so easy to tell apart in robot form.

265
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.280
There’s another problematic ship for you.

266
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.320
When it comes to Pokémon, enter the 
Japanese word and concept — kawaii.

267
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:37.280
Contrary to popular belief, kawaii does not mean 
‘cute.’ It means something much deeper. When  

268
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.800
something is kawaii, it means that it cannot 
not be cute. It means that this idol has been  

269
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:49.360
reduced to a state of existence where the ONLY 
opinion that can exist about it is that it’s cute.

270
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.400
Pokémon is a prime example, specifically with 
mascot characters like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Eevee —  

271
00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.720
and nearly all first-stage evolutions. But the 
example that typifies this process is Hello Kitty.

272
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.840
Hello Kitty, as a brand, is fascinating,  

273
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.560
but I won’t get into it here. 
Hold on, I need my cat ears—

274
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.120
Hello Kitty didn’t even have a piece of media 
it was attached to right away, but this little  

275
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.160
cartoon kitty seemed to be like something you 
would see in a TV special. But it wasn’t until  

276
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.280
the brand was already a national sensation 
in Japan that there was any visual media.

277
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.320
The process that makes Hello Kitty kawaii 
is an aesthetic exercise in minimalism and  

278
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.160
abstractism. You take a cat, and you gradually 
reduce features until you have a bare minimum  

279
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.000
amount of details that allow you to recognize 
this as a cat. Or Keroppi as a frog. Et cetera.

280
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.160
With so little features, this is 
not just a cat. Your imagination  

281
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.280
makes you pack-bond with the idea of a cat.

282
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.440
But when it comes to using toyetics 
to sell a given brand… well,  

283
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.120
Pokémon did it so well that nothing else 
has managed to come close. Even Disney.  

284
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.400
And Pokémon has only been around 
half as long as Hello Kitty.

285
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.920
It’s still not clear — even to cultural 
analysts — why or how Pokémon completely  

286
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.400
dominated culture to the point of traumatising 
Burger King employees. Things were ‘cute’ before  

287
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:16.640
Pokémon. Things have been ‘cute’ after Pokémon. 
So it's not really clear why it stands out.

288
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.840
But as Pokémon was first 
and foremost a video game,  

289
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.360
it managed to retain its market 
relevance as a video game when  

290
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.320
kids began making the christmas-list 
switch from action figures to games.

291
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.840
It’s difficult to make a cartoon or anime with 
a strong merchandise tie-in because video games  

292
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.120
occupy so much of the childrens’ market now. 
Pokémon endured because there was a monopoly.  

293
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.400
It’s almost not fair for any franchise to assess 
its success if Pokémon is seen as the standard.

294
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.840
We’re not here to talk about Pokémon — an anime 
with actually visible queer representation.

295
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.080
We’re here to talk about how Pokémon’s industry 
dominance has made it difficult for new media  

296
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.560
to focus their branding strategy around 
merchandising visually-distinct elements.

297
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.080
So for lack of up-front merchandisable effigies, 
how can you really make your media stick?

298
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.200
Well, that’s where shipping ties in…

299
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.480
I’m sure more than a few marketing directors 
noticed that there was a pattern of how certain  

300
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.400
media developed cult followings. Sometimes a 
TV series or movie will manage to stand the  

301
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.000
test of time specifically because it has 
a strong gay or gay-friendly following.

302
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.680
And this following is full of shippers. And 
when your audience is taking to social media to  

303
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.040
discuss non-canonical relationship dynamics, 
you can say that they’re pretty engaged.

304
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.760
As online fan communities dedicated themselves to 
filling in the blanks with fanfiction and fan art,  

305
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.840
networks across Japan and America 
realised they didn’t need a line of toys  

306
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.880
to tie-in to their franchise. An engaged 
audience is one that keeps tuning in,  

307
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.560
which means a longer-running 
show and increased ad revenue.

308
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.000
And apparently a stage production.

309
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.040
Branding executives said: “hold on a second… 
let’s lean into it and see what happens?”

310
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.240
Queer… became the new kawaii.

311
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.600
And maybe that was even better 
because there’s a whole lot less  

312
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.000
commitment involved in putting two young 
men in suggestively romantic situations  

313
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.720
than hiring an entire design team to create 
and focus-group a number of mascot figures  

314
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.320
in the hopes that just one of them would 
break through into cultural permeance.

315
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.320
Similar to how kawaii functions by 
minimalizing and removing features,  

316
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.440
so does the process of gay-baiting.

317
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.440
You take what is ostensibly a romance between 
two people. Whether it’s a gender-swap straight  

318
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.880
romance dynamic, or two bros who are too 
close to function. And then you remove  

319
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.080
explicitly romantic language until 
there is plausible deniability.

320
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.960
What remains in the plot is a 
collection of romantic visual cues,  

321
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:59.680
a very hot, intense, dedication, and devoted 
personal investment between two characters. Now,  

322
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.080
ships can take many forms — even in Sk8.

323
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.600
You’ve got the strong, pining commitment, but you 
also have the more distant, nobody-else-but-you,  

324
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.840
friend-rivals who rush to each other's side 
when the other gets physically assaulted in  

325
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.800
a skateboard race… which everyone 
seems perfectly fine with, by the  

326
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.520
way. You also have the abusive relationship 
with suggested ‘he can change’ tenderness.  

327
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.840
And you even have an alluded bitter 
friends-to-enemies scenario. With a catboy.

328
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.600
It’s hard to really gauge what exact 
qualities a pairing needs to have to be  

329
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.080
shippable, because everyone has their 
preferred ship dynamic and honestly…  

330
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.720
I think at this point people will ship any 
two-or-more characters for any reason. Just  

331
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.520
look at Avatar the Last Airbender and Legend 
of Kora. There really aren’t any limits.

332
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.560
What two characters do need 
to have to get shipped is just  

333
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.600
literally any kind of chemistry. 
But this chemistry needs to be BIG.

334
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.400
And of course I’m not saying ‘modern shipping 
bad.’ There are plenty of examples in media  

335
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.000
where you have two characters who are meant 
to be just friends. Believe it or not,  

336
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.800
there is still a demand for straight romances and 
creators willing to depict them. I know! I know…

337
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.440
As a result, there are a lot of instances where 
a creator makes a property with no intended queer  

338
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.840
reading, for which there is an audience who 
fully enjoys shipping two men in the plot.

339
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.840
The thing about Sk8 is that there’s a lot 
in here that’s genuinely entertaining.  

340
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.120
Great comedic timing, coupled with a carnivalesque  

341
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.280
approach to mixing skateboard culture, 
shonen melodrama, and good ol’ camp.

342
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.600
That said. Would I have watched it if it wasn’t  

343
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.240
for people recommending it to me 
because of the queer references?

344
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.080
… No. No… p… probably would not.

345
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.760
When it comes to media I do consume, 
I just gravitate towards gay stuff.  

346
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.400
Sorry. I spent the first 25 years of my life 
being dominated by heterosexual characters.  

347
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.040
And now that I’m making the decision to consume 
media about characters with whom I can identity…

348
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.040
…I’m still consuming straight meida.

349
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.000
Because in spite of the fact that Sk8 goes out 
of it’s way to imply that multiple characters  

350
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
are in queer pairings, it also goes out 
of it’s way to ‘confirm’ heterosexuality  

351
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.200
of one half of each couple. Either 
Reki’s random fawning over the girl  

352
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.960
in one episode for five minutes, 
or Joe’s chronic boob’d arm candy.

353
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:17.440
Funnily — the implicit ship that there isn’t any 
heterosexuality confirmation is… the villain.  

354
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.920
The villain who openly admits to 
‘loving’ underage skater-boys.

355
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:28.000
Which happens to be a recurring pattern within… 
media.. in general. For decades! The gay predator:  

356
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.120
still at large in 2022.

357
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.360
Even if the heroes are implied to be gay,  

358
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.920
the villain has the most 
pluasibly confirmed queerness.

359
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.640
I’m not willing to say that this is carrying 
deliberate homophobic subtextual messaging,  

360
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.000
though there is a role that bigotry 
has in modern queer baiting.  

361
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.280
But when it comes to Adam from 
Sk8 or Gozine from Banana Fish,  

362
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.000
their queerness, is much more explicit 
than that of our more understated heroes.

363
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.200
Compare and contrast to Yuri!!! On 
ICE. We’re already talking about Anime,  

364
00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.320
might as well jump in. And yes, I’ve already 
talked about it, but that shouldn’t suggest  

365
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.080
I don’t have evolving feelings on it.

366
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.520
I praised Yuri on Ice for it’s 
subtle representation of queerness,  

367
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.840
and I thought it was a greater asset than it 
was a detractor. Could it have used a kiss…?  

368
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.040
Without the arm blocking the way? Yes. But Yuri 
on Ice was also missing a lot of the staples of  

369
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.200
the other gay-baits. Mainly, that there was 
no third-wheel heterosexual love intrest.

370
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.400
And of characters who could be considered 
antagonists, Yuri-o softens as he begins to  

371
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.240
come into his budding, if only implied, attraction 
to Otabek. (Though how implied is this REALLY?)

372
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.920
And when it comes to JJ. Well, 
he’s straight, they can have him.

373
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.680
And I’m not completely absolving 
Yuri On Ice for concealing queerness,  

374
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.480
but it does seem like I’m pointing out that there 
are many ways that queer-baiting can happen.

375
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.560
Bear in mind that there is not as much 
‘shipping’ of Yuri and Victor as there is  

376
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.520
with Reki and Langa. By all means, it’s there. But 
as someone who is not particularly involved in any  

377
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:57.200
shipping communities, there is not nearly as much 
spill-over for Yuri on Ice as there is for Sk8.

378
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.200
It’s also interesting that the 2016 Yuri on 
Ice shippers went over to Killing Stalking,  

379
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200
but we won’t talk about that.

380
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.640
And this isn’t to speak of the popularity 
of either series, because years after the  

381
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.560
fact… and Yuri on Ice still seems to 
retain it’s popularity along side Sk8,  

382
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.320
which came out just this past year.

383
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.000
A distinction can be made where Yuri on 
Ice, while being much more understated,  

384
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.400
seems to want to imply that these 
characters ARE in a relationship.

385
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.840
Whereas Sk8 is going out of it’s way to imply 
that it’s characters COULD BE in a relationship.

386
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.400
And if we’re interested in getting 
into the nuance, there is a difference  

387
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.240
between an implication and a 
suggestion. As a matter of fact,  

388
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.200
I can sort queer-implied character 
pairings into four groups.

389
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.880
Of the ones I find tolerable…

390
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.160
We have Accidental Ships are when you 
have a creator who is making no effort  

391
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.960
to really depict queerness. 
They’re just making some art,  

392
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.280
and their audience takes it upon themselves 
to read into the chemistry between two given  

393
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.360
characters. Prime example would be Sokka 
and Zuko from Avatar the Last Air Bender.

394
00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.280
Subversive Ships are when a creator actively wants 
to depict queer characters, but is restricted  

395
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.560
either by network morality clauses, or national 
censorship laws. I would include Yuri On Ice,  

396
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.120
as per the ongoing battle to depict the core 
pairing openly, but also Legend of Korra’s  

397
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.793
Korrasami. As the creators wanted an out, bisexual 
female couple but had to settle for some hand  

398
00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:23.840
holding in the very last scene of the very last 
episode. At least they got to kiss in the comic.

399
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.640
And of the shipping groups that piss me off…

400
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.000
Oblivious Ships don’t annoy me 
so much but they still bother  

401
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.120
me. This is when you have creators who include 
a degree of platonic yearning where it’s not  

402
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:43.600
clear how they overlooked ‘gay’ as an option. A 
sub-sect of oblivious shipping is when you have  

403
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.800
a creative team that is either so misogynistic 
or so hyper-masculine that they procedurally  

404
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.120
eliminate all female characters, or make 
the women in the story so incredibly boring,  

405
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.000
that there is no one else to ship 
but the boys. Think of Supernatural.

406
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.560
And then, we have my least-favourite category 
— Industrial Shipping. This is the one I’ve  

407
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.160
been raising red flags over. An act of soulless, 
corporate infringement on the identity-centric  

408
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.440
needs for visible representation. This is what 
I would refer to as ‘traditional gay baiting.’  

409
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.160
And I’ve made multiple whole videos about 
this. But, for a prime example, see Teen Wolf.

410
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.360
I consider this malicious enough that it’s a 
pretty serious accusation to bring up — even when  

411
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.160
it’s about media that I do like. But am I willing 
to say that this is what’s going on in Sk8?

412
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.280
If it’s a deliberate branding tactic, then we 
have to consider who they are marketing to.  

413
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.880
And just like the largest consumer base of BL in 
television, anime, manga, and manhua are women,  

414
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.440
we can extrapolate that they would also be the 
most significant consumers of gay-baited content.

415
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.280
Which isn’t a bad thing in and of itself. 
There are more women than gay men in general,  

416
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.000
so the fact that they occupy 
a larger section of the market  

417
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.400
is probably something we can just 
take for granted. And similarly,  

418
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.120
straight women are also the largest group 
of creators who choose to depict gay men.

419
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.480
But if the suppliers of gay 
media are straight women…  

420
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.240
and the audience of gay media are 
straight women… what about gay men?

421
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.080
This whole topic of shipping is 
a sticky situation, isn’t it?  

422
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.400
Not just because it COULD be queer baiting, 
but because even the intentional ships aren’t  

423
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.640
meant for a gay audience. In most cases, 
they’re meant for a straight female audience.  

424
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.480
Hell, a very good portion of 
gay media that isn’t baited  

425
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.960
is really meant for a female audience. 
And a lot of it is even written by women.

426
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.000
Just going over some of the things 
I’ve covered in past videos: 

427
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.760
Killing Stalking, written by a woman.
Painter of the Night, written by a woman. 

428
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.680
Yuri on Ice, written by a woman.
Banana Fish, written by a woman. 

429
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.560
The Untamed, based on the 
books written by a woman.

430
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.160
I realise all of those examples come from 
Asian media, but this is not uniquely  

431
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.520
an Asian phenomenon. Many, in fact most, of the 
gay media that manages to reach a mainstream  

432
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.760
audience in the west is also written by women. 
Brokeback Mountain certainly comes to mind.

433
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.720
Gay Young Adult novels have become pretty popular 
in recent years, but the biggest crossover hits  

434
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.520
are almost exclusively written by women. Simon 
VS The Homosapien Agenda, also known as Love,  

435
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.480
Simon by Becki Albertali. Red, White and 
Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston. The Simon Snow  

436
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.200
novels by Rainbow Rowell, which are actually 
high concept Harry Potter fanfiction where  

437
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.080
Harry and Draco get together in the end. Though 
in the Simon Snow books the Harry analogue,  

438
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.920
Simon, has dragon wings, and the 
Draco analogue, Baz, is a vampire.

439
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.640
Now, I’m not saying that women shouldn’t write 
gay characters. I’ve read these books and I’ve  

440
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:45.440
really enjoyed them. Look. I’ve got them right 
here. But it is… interesting that the biggest gay  

441
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.640
books to hit it really big these past years 
have been written by women and not gay men.  

442
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.600
Including bestsellers like The Song of 
Achilles, which came out a decade ago,  

443
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.440
when I first read it, but recently became a 
mega hit when it was discovered by Book-Tock.

444
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.080
With the exception of books by Adam Silvera, 
you’d be hard pressed to find gay books that  

445
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.200
have gone mainstream. And it’s not like they 
don’t exist. Look at this. Look at this shelf.  

446
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.240
All of its gay. I’ve read them all and most 
of them are really good. Some of them are damn  

447
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.400
brilliant. But I ask, again, why is it that the 
majority of readers, let alone the general public,  

448
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.720
would probably only recognize the books written 
by female authors. Even in the olden times,  

449
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.840
books like The Frontrunner by Patricia Nell 
Warren published in 1974, or The Persian Boy by  

450
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.000
Mary Renault published in 1972. Gay books, 
written about gay men, written by women.

451
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.600
So why don’t gay men get to represent themselves 
in media? At least media that’s widely accepted  

452
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.920
by the mainstream? Queer women get to 
represent themselves. At least sometimes.  

453
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.560
Look at animated hits like Stephen Universe, 
or She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.

454
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.400
In fact we don’t really see a whole lot of 
non-canonical shipping among female characters.  

455
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.240
With the aforementioned gigantic 
exception of Xena and Gabrielle.  

456
00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.120
And the ship that actually 
became canon, Korrasammi.

457
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.240
But media has been much more accepting of out 
lesbian characters in recent years. Not always,  

458
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.640
for sure. Gay men dominated LGBT 
representation in media for a long time.

459
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.200
Specifically white gay men. But in recent 
years, producers, especially of television,  

460
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.360
have realized that lesbian characters are the 
perfect way for them to get points on the annual  

461
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.800
GLAAD Media List for representation. Straight men 
love lesbians, but usually only the ones who are  

462
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.640
hyper sexualized, straight women, for the most 
part, are pretty accepting of lesbians, and the  

463
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:36.720
assumption is that everyone on the LGBTQIAPA… D… 
2S+... spectrum will be accepting of them as well.

464
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.560
Look at this list. This is a pretty comprehensive 
list of lesbian, or at least women who love women,  

465
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.360
representation on TV. From shows as 
diverse as Hannibal, Glee, All My Children,  

466
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.000
Orange is the New Black, Killing Eve, Nancy Drew, 
and Doctor Who. Granted, many of these characters  

467
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.720
are written by straight male writers, so there is 
definitely an element of lesbian fetishization to  

468
00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.760
be accounted for. But a whole lot of them 
are written by lesbian or bisexual women.  

469
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.800
Which allows the characters to experience 
a range of storylines, many of which don’t  

470
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:13.280
involve their lesbianism at all. Allowing many 
of them to have some kind of a happy ending.

471
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.160
Which explains why there isn’t as much lesbian 
shipping as there is gay shipping. There doesn’t  

472
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.360
appear to be as much need for it. Where as a lot 
of the highest profile representations of gay men  

473
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.040
in media (Brokeback Mountain, Philadelphia, 
Milk) certainly do NOT have happy endings.  

474
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.400
Nothing of the sort. This is where 
the Bury your Gays trope came from.  

475
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.120
Which forces gay people, and people who want 
to see happy gay relationships (oddly enough,  

476
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.560
women) to create imaginary ones with characters 
who are not actually confirmed to be gay.

477
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.360
And so ships are built. Whether they’re pretty 
understandable, like with Steve and Bucky, Kirk  

478
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.680
and Spock, Sokka and Zuko, Aang and Zuko… hell, 
Kitara and Zuko, Toph and Zuko. Everyone and Zuko.

479
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.120
Oh, and one lesbian ship that did happen and I 
was 100% on board for, Yara and Daenerys from  

480
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:06.480
Game of Thrones. Should have happened. Should 
have been canon. Would have been amazing. And  

481
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.480
maybe if Dany had been banging a ship captain 
she wouldn't have forgotten about the iron fleet.

482
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.480
Anyway.

483
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.640
Not all ships are all that obvious 
though. Many times there’s not a  

484
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.400
hint of evidence but people want the 
relationship to be a thing anyway,  

485
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.920
like my own personal ship of James and Butch 
from the Pokémon anime. Who are obviously bitter  

486
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.720
exes. Or Rachel and Quinn from Glee. Magneto and 
Professor X. Cap and Ironman. Spiderman and Venom.

487
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.640
There’s not really any textual, 
or subtextual evidence that these  

488
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.360
pairings could ever actually be a thing, 
but since we need to create ships anyway,  

489
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.120
why not go the whole way and make some up 
out of whole cloth? For instance, in my point  

490
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.960
of view anyway, there’s a few pairings that I 
personally ship in the works of J*K R*W*L*I*N*G.

491
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.360
Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are obvious 
candidates. As well as Albus Potter and  

492
00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.480
Scorpis Malfoy in the broadway play, Cursed 
Child. Which, apparently, has kind of been  

493
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.600
confirmed now that the play has been condensed 
into a one night thing. I cannot confirm myself,  

494
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.920
since I havent seen it with my own eyes, 
but my broadway gays have told me this.

495
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.960
And of course the original ship to come out of J*K 
R*W*L*I*N*G’s work, Harry and Draco themselves.  

496
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.280
Now I never understood this, personally. I 
never felt any romantic tension between the  

497
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.360
two of them but apparently everyone else on the 
internet did. So much so that the fan-fiction  

498
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.360
fervour that arose online actually sparked a 
few producers to insert queer baiting into the  

499
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.640
text of their media on purpose to bring in 
fans. Such as with Teen Wolf and Sherlock.

500
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:42.080
Fans have written, literally, billions of words 
about these ships online. Whole libraries full  

501
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.120
of stories. All of this work to try and get 
some gay male couples to have a happy ending.  

502
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.720
And even this fan fiction, for the 
most part, is written by women.  

503
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.720
Gay men, for sure, contribute, but the vast 
majority of these fan-written works are written  

504
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.920
by women. Straight women, and lesbians funnily 
enough. And some of it goes very mainstream.

505
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.800
Like the Blood Right book series, which 
started its life as Finn/Poe fan fiction  

506
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.440
before being redeveloped and 
picked up by a publisher.

507
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.320
And again, I don’t want to say women 
shouldn’t write gay characters.  

508
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.120
The kawaii version of gayness created 
by these women has gone a long way to  

509
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.720
creating more acceptance of queer people, 
mainly queer men, among straight women.

510
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.120
But sometimes it gets kind of… creepy. After 
I released the Killing Stalking video you  

511
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.240
wouldn’t believe the amount of (mostly) straight 
women who told me they loved Killing Stalking  

512
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.080
because it let them explore extreme kinks without 
the associated trauma of a woman being involved.  

513
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.160
Which is just… no. Don’t do that. 
Do not use gay men as experiments.  

514
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.800
In real life or fiction. We’re not marionettes 
to play with for your amusement. Especially when  

515
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.840
something like Killing Stalking becomes a huge 
success and media producers might look and say  

516
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.480
“Ah. So this is how we should portray the gays.”

517
00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.440
Gay readers seem to love messy gay characters. 
Gay readers even love problematic gay characters.  

518
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.000
I sure do — I ship Hannibal and Will! Where 
the line is drawn is difficult to nail down  

519
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.280
though. But if we — gay men, women, lesbians, 
trans writers, and even straight men — are  

520
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.840
going to exist in a community of writers 
and content creators without gatekeepers,  

521
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.440
we need to be able to recognize how certain 
identities would like to be respected.

522
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.520
And while there aren’t any hard rules 
about this, the best way to pick up the  

523
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:33.840
guidelines are to listen to what these 
people have to say about themselves.

524
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.640
I realize this is heavily focused around the 
psychological condition of gay men. Who are,  

525
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.720
admittedly, probably the most privileged of the 
whole community. However — my concern comes from  

526
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.600
the development of a bunch of baby gays who are 
coming of age now and in the future. With them  

527
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.760
in mind, they are going to have to fight against 
a lot of patriarchal or even toxic masculinity.

528
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.023
(Insert Sean Penn quote)

529
00:41:58.023 --> 00:41:58.400
Ugh.

530
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.880
And insofar as queer acceptance is constructed 
around assimilation into straight values,  

531
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.480
the modern depiction of gay-baited 
pseudo-representation, constructed by straight  

532
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:11.920
people to feed into a straight industry, is going 
to perpetuate those straight values. And it is  

533
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.840
MUCH more difficult to un-indoctronate oneself 
from internalized homophobia than it is to model  

534
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:23.520
oneself after constructive, and realistic 
archatypes of openly-expressed queerness.

535
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:29.600
Because make no mistake, a growing trend 
of gay-baiting DOES communicate to gay  

536
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:36.400
audiences that the only way you can be visible 
in society… is to be straight. And coupled with  

537
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.760
the instances of visible gayness in awards-bait 
media where gay characters can only exist if  

538
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:48.720
they’re sad — we can only be ‘happy’ if we’re 
straight. Or at least not confirmed to be gay.

539
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.640
And even in this day and age of tolerance, we 
exist in a world that is consistently trying  

540
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.280
to shove us back into the closet, 
to define the acceptable expressions  

541
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.200
of our gayness, or to put us in dollhouses 
for the bemusement of a cis-het audience.

542
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.840
And so… we ship.

543
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.480
We ship characters created by 
straight writers. And indeed,  

544
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.880
straight writers are more likely to bury their 
gays. Is their perspective of queerness that it  

545
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.040
involves suffering insofar that suffering 
is the direct result of that queerness?

546
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.680
You will find bury your gays’ much more commonly 
in visual media. This becomes especially true  

547
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.880
as a particular piece of media 
is meant to receive awards.

548
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.720
Following the critical and awards-success 
of Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks,  

549
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.040
this seemed to be what Hollywood really latched 
on to as far as what it was willing to depict.

550
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.800
Didn’t help that Hollywood’s first big 
gay love story, Brokeback mountain,  

551
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.040
which not only featured one dead gay, a 
surviving gay who had to feel bad about it, and  

552
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.680
closeted, forbidden love, but 
it was written by a woman.

553
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.800
And as a piece of media made by a woman, 
developed into a film made by straight people,  

554
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.760
featuring straight actors, you naturally 
miss out on a lot of the nuances  

555
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.640
of being gay. Like, I don’t know, 
being blissfully ignorant to the  

556
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.680
consequences of bottoming without using 
lube after eating a plate full of beans.

557
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.280
But Brokeback Mountain itself is a great instance 
of the ethics behind writing outside your lived  

558
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.080
experiences. Writer Annie Proulx actually 
spoke out against a trend among gay men  

559
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.360
who shipped her Brokeback Characters Enis 
and Jack. She did not take kindly to gay men  

560
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.920
who wrote fan fiction and re-wrote her ending that 
they both survived and lived happily ever after.  

561
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.600
Having a dead gay was so important to her 
that she wrote angry articles about it.

562
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.440
She refused to listen to the voices of 
identities whom she used to expand her platform.

563
00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.800
Though yes these are her characters, Proulx was 
writing without the awareness that gay people,  

564
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:51.680
go figure, wanted an alternative story where they 
could be happy. She didn’t seem to understand why  

565
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:57.360
gay men would be so interested in re-writing 
her tragedy into an ending about happy gays.

566
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.480
By all means, it isn’t just women who do this. 
Call Me By Your Name was written by a straight  

567
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.280
man. And there were no burried gays, but 
there was a closeted romance and sad gays.

568
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.680
And because, for a significant amount of time,  

569
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.200
a dead gay was the only thing we 
could really expect from major media,  

570
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.920
as a reaction, we had to ship. The alternative 
to shipping was a world that believed that gay  

571
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.680
people’s only role in life was to offer up some 
saucy fashion advice and then die tragically.

572
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:32.240
Shipping our way to a world where we could be 
happy, however, may have snapped in the other  

573
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.520
direction. Particularly in publishing. Where 
queer writers are interested in exploring gay  

574
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.160
characters as they would factor into different 
genres of fiction, and exploring queer identity  

575
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.720
itself insofar as it exists in a world that 
is designed to cater to cis-het people.

576
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.200
However straight creators either 
lean to the melodramatically tragic,  

577
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.040
or the melodramatically…fluffy.

578
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.320
Which is how you get a whole generation 
of gays who have deblitating FOMO  

579
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.080
because their life experiences did not match  

580
00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:09.360
the experiences about gayness set by straight 
women with a kawaii idea of two gay people.

581
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:15.280
So there’s this kind of perfect storm of angst as 
different areas of media interplay off each other  

582
00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.360
and send conflicting messages. You 
have high-brow fiction telling us  

583
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.880
to expect tragedy. Which. Thanks for the anxiety.

584
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.520
You have mass-consumption media which takes 
gay emotions and removes gay expiriences,  

585
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.440
leaving a husk of empty gestures and 
unanswered questions which feels more  

586
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.280
like a gambling addiction than 
even implied representation.

587
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.200
And then, in response to that, you have  

588
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.840
publishing. Where gay authors are trying to 
depict their own experiences with queerness,  

589
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:47.040
but where a lot of content being created is either 
an overly positive response to gay tragedy-media,  

590
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.680
or as filling in the blanks that 
media like Sk8 refuses to fill in.  

591
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.400
And in either case that results in this weird 
rose-tinted world where the beginning and end of  

592
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.280
the queer expirience is defined by your ability to 
have a boyfriend and look cute being gay together.

593
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.400
And sure. Yes I did just make a video about how 
we need to have more queer representation in  

594
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:14.960
media directed at children. But just like there 
are hordes of queer people who literally always  

595
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.840
knew that they were queer (myself included), 
it’s just as valid that some people literally  

596
00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.840
don’t have a clue they were gay until they’re 
in their twenties, thirties, forties, whenever.

597
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.840
And while I’d like to say that it’s perfectly 
valid that teenagers like Reki and Langa  

598
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.200
don’t have their crap together yet, 
what about the other two heavily  

599
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.120
implied pairings that the show is counting 
on the audience shipping the crap out of?  

600
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.240
To say nothing of how strongly the show sets up 
Reki and Langa in visually-romantic settings.

601
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.120
And I’d like to say that Yuri!!! On Ice has every 
right to be as understated as it wants to be,  

602
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.200
because sometimes you do want a relationship 
drama where the drama does not come from the  

603
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:56.080
relationship. And this would be fine if this 
was not the (almost) only way we had to consume  

604
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:02.000
queer characters. And that understated ‘subtlety’ 
just starts to feel like a cop-out after a while.  

605
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.560
It would be nice if this wasn’t 
the excuse every. Single. Time.

606
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.400
And because these instances are so 
subtle, either by design or necessity,  

607
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.640
we, L, G, B, T’s, and Q’s have 
to endure a barrage of straights  

608
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.040
trying to beat us down. All we really want is 
the ability to project our shared experiences  

609
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.120
to re-enforce our community bonds. But 
somewhere, there’s a straight person saying  

610
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.920
that we’re ‘forcing gayness’ into everything. 
But the only reason we have to read queerness  

611
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.640
into anything is because it’s been ‘forced OUT’ 
of society for the last couple hundred years.

612
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.200
Or that we get ‘crazy’ when people 
refuse to see the obvious coding of  

613
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.800
clearly gay characters. Because 
it’s not enough to say ‘hey.  

614
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.760
This experience really reminds me of some 
formative moments of my adolescence.’  

615
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.440
There’s some straight person who’s never been 
worried about being rejected by their family  

616
00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.720
saying that Luca is absolutely a cis-het 
mood. And you’re crazy for thinking otherwise!

617
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.680
And in order for us to consume actual feel-good 
gay media that is even remotely happy,  

618
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:11.280
we have two options. Watch fictional gay people 
having expiriences we’re never going to have,  

619
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.080
or fictional presumed-straight people having  

620
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.120
pretty gay expiriences that look a 
whole lot like the ones we have had.

621
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.200
Not to mention that there is a quiet 
homophobia to the celebration of gay-baiting.  

622
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:27.600
Our implicit romances are being framed under 
the pretence of being something forbidden.

623
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:33.920
And I have to say that there is this kind 
of insensitivity around the popularity of  

624
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.520
forbidden romance. Because here in the queer 
community, forbidden romance is kind of  

625
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.560
the EXACT OPPOSITE of what we’re trying 
to accomplish with our fight for rights.

626
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.480
That we need to work so damn incrementally 
to get real representation is so  

627
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.400
frustrating. By now we should have 
gay mainstream movies on the regular,  

628
00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.000
gay TV shows that arent just about 
teaching straight men how to wash  

629
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.840
their asses. Stories that aren’t just 
fantasy outcomes, or horrible outcomes.

630
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.320
But no. We’re stuck here arguing about fish 
boys, and searching for justification that  

631
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:15.280
mens’ figureskating JUST MIGHT be stuffed 
with glorious queers, and fighting people  

632
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.240
who insist they’re straight every step of 
the way. We’re no further ahead than we  

633
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:28.560
were when Queer as Folk was on TV and Brokeback 
Mountain came out in 2005. SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO.

634
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.160
Oh god I feel old.

635
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.240
You’d think, especially in the world of anime 
production, the success of shows like Given,  

636
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.640
both its animated and live-action adaptation, 
would light a fire under producers and make  

637
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.480
them realize theres a hell of a market 
out there for non-baited gay content.

638
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.040
And I’m not letting Hollywood off the hook either.  

639
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.880
Half the damn city is gay. Where. 
Are. My. Gay. Superheroes Marvel!?

640
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.640
My marketing brain tells me they’re 
missing out on so much money,  

641
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.440
seeing how the writing is on the wall when it 
comes to BL fiction. Even here in North America,  

642
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.960
there’s a consumer base far larger than 
you would expect for subtitled cute-boy  

643
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.840
gay-drama from Korea and Tailand 
and Taiwan and, yes even Japan.

644
00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.080
Which forces me through a mental 
obstacle course to reason why  

645
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.520
they wouldn’t be capitalising on this! And the 
conclusion I come to is that they are making a  

646
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:24.320
comfortable profit off of our titillation. That 
this rash of gay-baiting is not only deliberate,  

647
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.320
calculated, and modeled, but that we are 
encouraged to do it. We, the audience,  

648
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.160
are encouraged to fill in the blanks that 
some… corporation has left empty on purpose.

649
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.880
And the fact that this kind of gay-bait is 
looped in with visible queer representation  

650
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.240
isn’t unintentional either. Producers want 
this to be tied to other actively queer media  

651
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.920
to lend it validity, and feed into the fanbase 
which already ships what they are intended to.

652
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.040
Having Reki and Langa doesn’t mean we have 
more gay representation. Having Hiyori and  

653
00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:03.760
Ikuya isn’t more gay representation. It’s media 
gaslighting. It’s malicious. It’s dishonest.  

654
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.720
It’s fraudulent. It’s telling us we 
should be satisfied with effigies.

655
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.040
And the worst part is that it’s working.

656
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.720
It’s so successful to the point where 
corporations encourage us to ship  

657
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.840
real people. Half of BTS is shipped together. 
And once upon a time One Direction, when they  

658
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.440
realised that their fanbase shipped them, 
even played into it by hugging each other  

659
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:29.920
a lot. And even kissing sometimes. Which has 
become a staple of almost all k-pop boy-bands.

660
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.080
Boy band personalities are all developed by focus  

661
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.800
groups so they might as well be 
fiction right? Why not ship them?

662
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.760
But then there arises the problem of shipping real 
human beings where; (a) you remove their ability  

663
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:44.960
to self-declare identity; (b) if it is something 
like a boy band, or two television costars,  

664
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.840
you’re feeding into a corperation’s exploitation 
of sexual identity as a marketing ploy, and;  

665
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:56.560
(c) it is a reduction of gayness to an object 
of fascination, a charicature or steryeotype,  

666
00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.640
rather than how some people live their 
lives because that’s who they are.

667
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.720
So again… is… shipping… bad…?

668
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.840
Honestly when it comes to you in your room 
alone at night I say the sky’s the limit.  

669
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.240
Ship as much as you want. 
Ship as much as you need.

670
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.160
Even when it comes to making ships that, like 
the Blood Right series, go on to have their  

671
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.720
IP serial numbers filed off and made into 
their own standing property, by all means.

672
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.800
Show Marvel, and Star Wars, 
and other gay-baiters that  

673
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.560
there is an audience out there 
that they’re missing out on.

674
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.400
But when it DOES come to depicting characters 
that are outside your lived experience,  

675
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:38.080
all I ask is that you please be respectful of 
these communities’ need for self-determination.  

676
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.840
And if you do reach critical acclaim, please 
help promote other gay, lesbian, bisexual,  

677
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:49.520
and trans creators themselves. And honestly, most 
authors already do just that. And the favouratism  

678
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.840
of women when it comes to depicting gay 
men is more of an ‘industry’ problem.

679
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.080
My concerns are primarily directed 
at the ways these industries  

680
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.880
use shipping as a way to manipulate fanbases.  

681
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.400
So if you are going to ship, I would advise you to 
be aware of which series ‘want’ you to ship their  

682
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:14.240
characters, because you may very well be nothing 
more than a cog in their marketing machine.

683
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.560
And you’re a person. Not a billboard. And I don’t  

684
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.200
like that some media producers 
treat their audiences like that.

685
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.680
But how can we separate media that is actively 
trying to manipulate their audience into shipping,  

686
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.880
media that is actively trying to subvert 
conservative values, and media which is full  

687
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.960
of well-written and flushed out characters 
who share strong chemistry with each other?

688
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.360
The only answer I can offer is that… It… depends?

689
00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:43.200
On like… a lot of things. But mostly, 
it depends on intention. Which sucks  

690
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.840
because that’s the only thing 
that you really can't gauge.  

691
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.840
Especially that, if we’re gonna get philosophical, 
people are rarely honest with themselves.

692
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:58.480
I’m making a monetized video about how it’s bad 
that corporations are using queerness to sell  

693
00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:03.680
a product without actually either promoting 
queer identity, or promoting queer creations.  

694
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.800
Is there really a way to objectively say 
that I’m not just making this video for  

695
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.240
the money? Other than the fact that my 
YouTube ad revenue is NOT impressive.

696
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.440
But there’s no way for you, the audience, 
to verify if I’m being disingenuous or not.  

697
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.800
If I’m baiting you anymore or any less than 
these producers I’ve been ranting about.

698
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.280
I’ve spent the last two years on 
here, on literally every live stream,  

699
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.440
talking about how my dream is to make movies 
and series about queer characters that aren’t  

700
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.000
JUST about being queer. A way to give back 
to the community, create movies and series,  

701
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
the likes of which I never got to see growing 
up. Hell, I still don’t get to see them much.

702
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.560
But I haven’t actually gone 
ahead and done that, now have I?  

703
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.080
You can assume I will actually 
give back to the community,  

704
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.320
create works for the community that go 
above and beyond youtube. But will I?

705
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.440
Just like we assume that creators who encourage  

706
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.120
shipping, either actively via baiting, or 
inactively by just supporting fan communities,  

707
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.800
have the best interest of the queer 
community at heart. But do they really?  

708
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.640
Most probably do! But some probably don’t… 
How the hell are we supposed to know?

709
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.680
We used to think that J*K*R*W*I*G 
was the biggest queer ally in the  

710
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.000
world, and oh boy did that blow up in our faces.

711
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.240
Instead, why not put some power 
in the hands of queer creators?  

712
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.840
So we don't have to guess if a pairing 
is supposed to be a couple for real,  

713
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.360
if we’re being baited by a corporation, or if 
we really are just reading too much into things.

714
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.160
So shipping is probably fine, as long as 
we’re dealing with fictional characters.

715
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:36.640
We keep asking for the real thing, we keep 
begging for it. For years. Decades. We say “please  

716
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.080
let me see myself on screen without it being 
about dying, gay bashing, being depressed, or some  

717
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:49.360
completely illogical teen fantasy. Please.” But 
we don’t get it. So we have to play make-believe.  

718
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.560
But why play make believe when we 
can make the real thing ourselves?

719
00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:03.120
So I’m starting a production company. Telos 
Pictures. Which will focus exclusively on  

720
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.440
queer stories written by queer people for queer 
audiences. And if the straights wanna watch too,  

721
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.080
by all means. But I think there’s a pretty 
sizable audience out there for this kind of thing.  

722
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.720
After all, 14% of the United States is African 
American – and Tyler Perry used that to create  

723
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:23.520
an empire of afro-american-centric 
media produced for black audiences.

724
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:31.520
However… Recent polling shows that 1 in 6 
adults born after 1989 identify as LGBT.  

725
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.000
That’s 16 percent! Let’s see what we can do!

726
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.520
As much as I believe that people outside the 
LGBT community can and should write about us,  

727
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:47.120
I believe the best way to communicate our 
experience is to create media that they can use to  

728
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.840
help expand their understanding of gay, lesbian, 
trans, bisexual, and nonbinary expiriences.

729
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.400
Now I’m going need some help, and I don’t expect 
to burst onto the scene with some million dollar  

730
00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.160
movies. We’ll start small and build our way 
up. If you’re interested in supporting this,  

731
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.160
or just want to find out more, visit the

732
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.360
We’ve got a lot in the works, and I’d love 
to have you on board. This is a team effort.  

733
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:21.840
Let’s show those heteros we mean business.
