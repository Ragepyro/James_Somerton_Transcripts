00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.359
hello hello everyone welcome to the
padreon for monday june 13th 2022 my

2
00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.160
name is james
and nick's not here um

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.480
nick has decided to take an extended
leave of absence no he's um

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.680
just visiting his family and decided to
stay a bit longer than originally

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.720
planned
and since he hasn't gotten to see his

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.359
family in
years since before the pandemic started

7
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.320
i would say that that's pretty justified
um

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.200
so instead of spending this episode of
the padreon just rambling on about some

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.440
random things
because then it would just be me saying

10
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.039
um for about 30 minutes of an hour-long
podcast

11
00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
i decided to do something a little
different

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
um
as you can see i'm humming already

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.960
i've been working on a memoir because
i'm just that full of myself

14
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.120
and
i thought maybe i could read the first

15
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.360
couple of chapters
for you for this

16
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.560
padreon
and you know see what you think see if

17
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.840
it's worth continuing and also get some
honest feedback as well that would be

18
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.479
really good
so

19
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.640
uh tentatively it's called seven days to
the weekend

20
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.360
all right so chapter one
adventures in coming out

21
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.000
i've always been a very impatient person
as anyone who's worked with me can admit

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so when i finally came to the
realization that i was in fact gay i was

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.880
quite annoyed at the idea of the closet
i wanted everyone to know how else was i

24
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.240
supposed to find a boyfriend if nobody
else laid

25
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.640
sorry
how else was i supposed to find a

26
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.439
boyfriend if nobody knew that i liked
boys

27
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.880
hope that there was some kind of gay
telepathy that gaydar actually was an

28
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.920
inherent trait
i didn't have time to wait around for

29
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.640
people to ask or for people to realize
it or horror of horrors wait for quote

30
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.640
the right time to come out
i had to get this train moving enough

31
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.800
waiting i'd been in the closet plenty
long enough already

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560
the very first person i told was my best
friend mark who i'd been best friends

33
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.080
with since i was about seven
we were practically inseparable

34
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.000
throughout elementary school we both
loved wrestling video games anime and

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.400
horror movies we even went on vacation
with each other's families we were like

36
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.400
two halves of one hole
so i had to tell him as soon as possible

37
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.000
because yes at the tender age of 11 i'd
already fallen into the age-old trap of

38
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.599
being totally in love with your straight
best friend

39
00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.000
but how did i know he was straight he
didn't know i was gay yet so for all i

40
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.480
knew he could be gay too
i had to be strategic about it though

41
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.519
i'd seen the movies and tv shows where
someone comes out and then their

42
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.239
straight best friend wants nothing to do
with them

43
00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.720
i couldn't give him the opportunity to
do that i'd be heartbroken so i waited

44
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.640
until that coming summer break between
fourth and fifth grade when he'd be

45
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.920
coming with my family to the little
cottage we rented near a lake named

46
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.720
ainsley
it was a part of a small campground

47
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720
called sunset cottages and my mother
father and i had been going there every

48
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.720
summer for the last couple of years
i loved it because it had an in-ground

49
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800
swimming pool which meant i didn't need
to go anywhere near the dirty lake

50
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.560
i still prefer pools to natural bodies
of water

51
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.720
and best of all the campground was in
the middle of nowhere

52
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.280
about an hour away from the nearest
grocery store three hours away from home

53
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.280
there was nowhere for mark to run if he
was straight he'd have to live with me

54
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.360
being gay for at least the length of the
trip in the same bedroom no less so i'd

55
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.159
have plenty of time to make sure that we
went home still friends if not more

56
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.680
so on the first night there after we'd
unpacked and we're watching one of about

57
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.120
a dozen movies we'd rented from
blockbuster on the way up mark and i

58
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.200
laid on our beds in the tiny bedroom
there was a horrible rainstorm whipping

59
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.720
up outside our window which was great
for the ambiance of the particular

60
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.640
friday the 13th we were watching and
even better because if mark reacted

61
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.680
badly he'd be even less likely to run
away

62
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.480
what straight boy is dramatic enough to
run out into a rainstorm right

63
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.040
i really need to tell you something i
said to him pausing the movie

64
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880
he looked over at me with fear in his
eyes and my stomach dropped

65
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.880
that wasn't a phrase he was very fond of
and not because he regularly had friends

66
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.639
coming out to him but because it was the
first word spoken to him by his mother

67
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.360
when his father died that had been a few
years ago but that along with the sight

68
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.240
of a certain make of minivan could still
send

69
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.520
chills down his spine
what he asked with a quiver in his voice

70
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.520
ah jesus i couldn't do this not now i'd
messed up

71
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.759
ah it's nothing i said sorry
jimmy what is it he asked

72
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.400
everyone called me jimmy back then
before i finally made the switch to

73
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.840
james when i moved to film school

74
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.360
nothing i laughed
i was just being dumb

75
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.000
crap i think i forgot my game boy in the
car

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.600
was i really that bad at covering things
up god i'd have to come out there was no

77
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.720
way i'd be able to stay in the closet
with a poker face like this

78
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.759
i got up from my bed and approached the
closed door determined to break the

79
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.360
moment and
walk out into the pouring rain to look

80
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.120
for the game boy i knew was under my
pillow but the door was closer to mark's

81
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.560
bed and he jumped up to get there before
me blocking my way i [ __ ] you not

82
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.720
what is it he demanded i knew mom was
being weird before i left she wants you

83
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.199
to tell me something
what i asked completely perplexed no

84
00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.919
nothing like that i didn't even talk to
your mom

85
00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.880
but my mom talked to your mom and she
told her to tell you to tell me

86
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.639
something right so tell me
how the hell had this blown up in my

87
00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.720
face so quickly
your mom didn't tell anyone anything i

88
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.199
said at least no one told me anything i
just i just need to get my game boy your

89
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.680
game boy is on your bed he said and it's
on so you should probably turn it off is

90
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.360
it i ask turning back to see the little
hunk of see-through purple plastic that

91
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.160
had just betrayed me
oh it is

92
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.919
maybe i need glasses or something
tell me what's going on jimmy i swear to

93
00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.680
god okay what did mom say nothing don't
lie i can tell when you're lying

94
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.120
apparently
i'm well that was a fine job of the

95
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.080
words just not leaving my mouth at all
your what he asked can we sit back down

96
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.120
no
mark i'm gay

97
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.199
i know that but what did my mom say your
mom didn't say anything i almost yelled

98
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.240
catching my voice and then slipping into
a whisper

99
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.039
what do you mean you know i'm gay
we've been friends for like years

100
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.639
you always want to re-watch wrestlemania
10 where shawn michaels moons the crowd

101
00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.919
and your favorite dragon ball z
character is trunks

102
00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.840
i just got read by a straight boy
presumed straight

103
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.520
well i began and suddenly this question
weighed a lot heavier than actually

104
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.240
coming out did
are you gay no he said loudly

105
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.599
no he said flatly sorry
what do you mean sorry you probably have

106
00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.800
a crush on me
i should have been offended in fact i

107
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.520
acted offended even though he was
completely right

108
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.800
what do you mean i laughed you're not my
type i like blonde guys

109
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.680
so how come you always stare at me when
we go swimming

110
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.960
the straight boy had been paying way too
much attention to where my eyes had been

111
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.080
looking uh because i stammered
he cocked his eyebrow i hated it when he

112
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.919
did that he looked so cute
go on he said

113
00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.000
well so what if i do
so you do then

114
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.479
he sat back down on his bed and i stayed
standing i didn't say i did i said so

115
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:35.919
what if i do
i wouldn't be mad

116
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.840
okay
nothing really different i guess just

117
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.479
you know don't hit on me or anything
okay then i said and then sat back down

118
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:48.639
on my bed pressing play on the vcr
a few moments went by as we sat in

119
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.759
silence watching a big boobed camp
counselor getting paled

120
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:56.800
mark laid on his stomach chin resting on
his palms while i sat a bolt upright

121
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.960
and greece
he said

122
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.599
huh
you like greece

123
00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:04.000
he said
like a lot

124
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.560
i don't know any guys who like musicals
well then

125
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.599
i guess my first coming out could have
gone a whole lot worse

126
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:14.639
the rest of the vacation went smoothly
with mark keeping my secret from my

127
00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.400
parents for me and giving me knowing
looks every time he pulled himself out

128
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.759
of the pool
he thought i was looking at his butt but

129
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.759
i was not looking at his butt his shorts
were just very tight and yellow so they

130
00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:28.800
grabbed your attention that's all in any
case

131
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.680
he didn't seem to mind
i decided to try my luck once again

132
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.719
later that summer when i came out to my
friend beverly

133
00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.080
we were hanging out in my basement a
favorite place of all my friends since i

134
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.640
was cool

135
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.279
sorry
a favorite place of all my friends since

136
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:50.560
it was cool all summer long down there
i'm gay i said with no preamble

137
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.360
beverly screamed then jumped up down
hugged me and spun me around oh my god

138
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.360
gay best friend she squealed
i totally knew but i'm so happy that you

139
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.399
told me
apparently she knew because the year

140
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.959
prior she myself mark and our friend
matt would play jerry springer show in

141
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:11.680
my basement beverly and mark would be
quote dating and then bev would reveal

142
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.560
that she was cheating with matt or she
and matt would be quote dating and she'd

143
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.480
reveal that she was cheating with mark
but i was always

144
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.360
always jerry apparently my lack of
interest in pretending to date her made

145
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.720
it loud and clear that i was much more
interested in mark

146
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.399
by the time she went home that day she'd
let me know that she thought i'd had a

147
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.519
crush on mark but refute
sorry by the time she went home that day

148
00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.880
she'd let me know that she thought i had
a crush on mark but i refused to confirm

149
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.680
it
was i that damn obvious

150
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.720
i hadn't even really admitted it to
myself and yet everyone else seemed to

151
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.640
know
round three of coming out was the real

152
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.519
tester
my grandmother

153
00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.519
she'd been a nun in her youth before
leaving the sisterhood to become a nurse

154
00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:01.839
and give birth to 12 children one of
whom was my mom

155
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:06.079
that was long ago though at this point
in her life she mostly just sat down in

156
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:10.480
her recliner and watched tv
diabetes had long ago taken most of her

157
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.640
sight and caused kidney damage so severe
that she had to have dialysis treatment

158
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.320
three times a week
because she wasn't very active most of

159
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.360
the grandkids didn't come around that
often at least not the boys but i did a

160
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.640
few days a week i'd come over after
school and sit down with her and watch

161
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.839
soap operas with her
she listened to them mostly because the

162
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:34.640
tv was a blur to her at that point but
that's what was great about soap operas

163
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.320
they're all dialogue so you could still
enjoy them

164
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.360
i like to think my love of pro wrestling
grew out of watching soap operas with

165
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.959
her wrestling is in the end just a soap
opera with more action so one cold day

166
00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.040
in october while my grandfather was out
at a pumpkin patch my grandmother and i

167
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.800
sat down in the warm living room
watching days of our lives when the show

168
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.320
went to a commercial break i asked her
man

169
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.959
what does god think of gay people
since she was a former nun and the only

170
00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:06.560
even semi-religious person in the family
i figured she'd be the authority on the

171
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.399
subject
not taking her eyes off of the tv she

172
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.880
said
well

173
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.560
people say it's adam and eve not adam
and steve

174
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.600
but i don't think god said anything
about gay people

175
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.399
i know he doesn't make mistakes though
so he meant for gay people to be here

176
00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:29.360
and then she looked over at me
why do you ask i was just wondering i

177
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.320
said mom was watching will and grace and
i just thought about it

178
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.560
that's a funny show she said
what if i was gay

179
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:43.519
i asked or someone else were related to
well she said and thought for a moment

180
00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.880
god helped the person whoever said a
nasty word to them about it

181
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.240
i'm tougher than i look you know she
winked and i smiled

182
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.480
you could rough him up man i said
yep she agreed

183
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.279
or get someone else to people owe me
favors

184
00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:01.279
i laughed again as the commercial break
came to an end as the cheesy music swept

185
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:05.279
back into the room my grandmother looked
back over to the screen

186
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:08.000
should have been adam and steve anyway
she said

187
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.040
eve just had to go ahead and eat that
apple steve would have went for the

188
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.959
bananas
while i was walking home that day which

189
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:18.639
was only about four streets away my
grandmother called my mother

190
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.240
hello my mom had said
jimmy just left here and theresa he's

191
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.399
gay i don't want you to say a single
mean word to him if you turn him out

192
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:31.120
i'll never speak a word to you again
ma jesus my mother gasps i know he's gay

193
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.240
it's fine
you take care of him theresa she said

194
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.760
he's going to need us
so it seemed everyone important to me

195
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.160
knew that i was gay before i did
and my grandmother was right

196
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.399
i was going to need them
i apologize for um

197
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:54.079
little mistakes that i'm making
while reading um

198
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.000
this is absolutely not proof red

199
00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:02.800
chapter 2
knock on wood

200
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.680
i always say that i never really
experienced a whole lot of homophobia

201
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.360
growing up which is mostly true
whenever someone wanted to hit a nerve

202
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.440
with me they'd make fun of my weight as
i was overweight since i was about three

203
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.639
once you're out of the closet making fun
of you for being gay doesn't really have

204
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:20.880
that much punch anymore that's fine with
being gay so most bullies knew that

205
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.200
there was no point in focusing in on
that

206
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.360
so they focused in on my belly instead
i was not okay with my belly which

207
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.440
continues to haunt me to this day
but not everyone was clever enough to

208
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.440
direct their bullying to my body issues
my coming out process continued

209
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.880
throughout the fifth grade the girls
were excited to have a gay friend the

210
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.959
guys were mostly nonchalant about it
always telling me to not hit on them but

211
00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:45.519
inevitably wanting to know if i thought
they were hot

212
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:50.880
straight male egos are fragile evil
straight male egos are fragile even in

213
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.800
childhood
the teachers were perplexed at how

214
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.480
brazen i was about it the principal was
constantly calling my friends into the

215
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.079
office for saying that i was gay only
for me to finally come in and proclaim

216
00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:07.199
to the whole damn staff that i was
the gym teacher who i later learned was

217
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:12.000
a lesbian go figure started to act as my
protector during recess and lunch breaks

218
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.839
always keeping an eye on the other kids
to make sure i wasn't in any kind of

219
00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:18.639
danger which was hard to gauge since a
bunch of other kids and myself had

220
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:23.360
started the kwf kid wrestling federation
and wrestled every day during recess and

221
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.199
lunch on the grass outside school
it only became an issue when a wire

222
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.560
fence was put up to separate the school
grounds from the street and we had the

223
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.760
brilliant idea to start having cage
matches

224
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.040
so all in all but for a few
misadventures with teachers thinking i

225
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.720
was being bullied by my own friends
nothing had really changed

226
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.680
we were all kids kissing was
as far as anyone had gone and even that

227
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.959
was only a select few
so what difference did it make if i

228
00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:54.720
liked boys or girls
but not everyone felt that way

229
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.720
this story is hard to tell not because
i'm traumatized by it or something but

230
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.600
because there are big chunks i simply
can't remember

231
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.639
most of it's taken from things told to
me by my family

232
00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:08.240
i know that in the following spring i
was walking home from school on a friday

233
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.279
i'd stayed late because me and a group
of friends were practicing for the

234
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:15.839
upcoming talent show and where all 12 of
us were performing

235
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:19.279
sorry i'd stayed late because me and a
group of friends were practicing for the

236
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:23.600
upcoming talent show where all 12 of us
were to perform greased lightning

237
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.839
i'd convinced nine straight guys to
dance to greece lightning mark as well

238
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:32.480
as my friends beverly and carrie
including mark as well as my friends

239
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.920
beverly and carrie
the choreography i'd come up with was so

240
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.560
complex the music teacher was taking it
upon himself to help us out after class

241
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.759
so i was winded being asthmatic but
exhilarated

242
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:46.720
until i heard some guys come up behind
me

243
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.880
hey [ __ ] i heard one of them yell
i was only a few houses away from where

244
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.759
i lived so i decided to simply not
engage with them

245
00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.639
to simply not engage with the guys who
all appeared to be three or four years

246
00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:02.880
older than me so i set my head forward
and walked a bit faster

247
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.600
my little brother said you're a [ __ ] i
heard

248
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.839
you're gonna [ __ ] molest them
two houses away just get home

249
00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:13.279
i look back again
they were obviously in high school 16 or

250
00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.800
17 years old
leave me alone i said and then turn back

251
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.880
toward my house so close
and then a white light spread across my

252
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.920
vision and pain flared in the back of my
head

253
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.720
i remember that white light clear as day
a rock the size of an adult man's fist

254
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.240
fell to the ground behind me i touched
the back of my head terrified that i

255
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.279
might be bleeding
i didn't feel anything though

256
00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:38.720
so once the white light had subsided i
ran to my house

257
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.920
i told my mom what had happened as soon
as i got home and she burst out into the

258
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.759
street to find the guys who attacked me
but they disappeared

259
00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:48.320
probably run through the yard of some
neighbors

260
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.920
i remember her deciding then and there
that i'd be driven to and from school

261
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.600
from now on even though i lived on the
same street as the school

262
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.040
she didn't want to risk it
my head wasn't bleeding and there didn't

263
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.800
seem to be a bump but she wasn't taking
any chances

264
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.959
i can't remember most of that weekend
honestly until sunday afternoon i was

265
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:10.480
hanging out with my friend nathan in his
garage we were comparing our digimon

266
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.240
cards and
we were comparing our digimon cards when

267
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.400
that white light came back for a split
second followed by a weird swirling

268
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.480
rainbow in the corner of my eye
i didn't know what was going on but it

269
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.079
felt like my eyes were being pulled
toward the rainbow

270
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.919
then i was in a hospital bed doctors and
nurses smiling around me once they

271
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:33.440
noticed that my eyes were open they
started asking me questions did i know

272
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.320
my name did i know the date did i know
what town i was in but i couldn't speak

273
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.280
i knew the answers to all the questions
but i couldn't force my mouth to make

274
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.160
the sounds the frustration of not being
able to answer them drove me to tears

275
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.600
one of the nurses who was actually
nathan's mom was holding my hand

276
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.480
repeatedly telling me that i was going
to be okay that my mom was on her way

277
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.440
only moments after the door to the room
burst open

278
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.400
my mom and two of my aunts lunging into
the room

279
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.120
my aunt kathy immediately went to the
door

280
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.799
my aunt kathy immediately went to the
doctor my aunt kelly went to the nurses

281
00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:10.480
and my mom came to me she took my other
hand and tears in her eyes started

282
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.919
telling me that i was okay
i tried speaking but i couldn't which

283
00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:17.200
just drove me further into tearful
hysterics

284
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.720
kathy approached my mom and said he's
had a seizure the doctor said he's out

285
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.320
of it though
why can't he talk my mom asked

286
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.320
that happens sometimes nathan's mom
answered it'll pass he just needs to

287
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.240
take it easy
and so that's what we did

288
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.440
i laid in that bed my mom holding my
hand for about an hour before i was

289
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.120
finally able to form words again the
general hospital i'd been admitted to

290
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.120
released me later that day but when
night had fallen and i still couldn't

291
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.640
and i still wouldn't eat my parents got
worried and took me to the larger

292
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.160
regional hospital
we admit they who admitted me and kept

293
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.520
me overnight for observation
they wouldn't let my parents stay the

294
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.039
night so i slept in a very large lonely
room for the night

295
00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:00.720
the next morning the nurses told me i
couldn't go home unless i ate so i

296
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.840
choked down the horrible breakfast and
within minutes was in the car with my

297
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.360
parents driving away
but they had to pull over so i could

298
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.720
puke before we'd even gotten out of the
parking lot

299
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.600
as it turns out i hadn't had one seizure
but multiple one right after the other

300
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.600
the neurologist i saw diagnosed me with
epilepsy and prescribed tegritol to help

301
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.200
control the seizures
my parents knew what about

302
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.200
my parents knew what had brought this on
the rock off the back of my head

303
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.480
but there was nothing anyone could do
about it because i didn't know the boys

304
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.240
who'd been behind me that day
i didn't know who the little brother was

305
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.679
i didn't know any names so we couldn't
report anyone to the police

306
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:41.360
my parents did talk to the cops though
it led to nothing

307
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.240
if the police had been halfway
interested they probably could have

308
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.120
asked the neighbors if they'd seen
anything but they didn't seem to be all

309
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.799
that interested in helping a gay kid
not the last time i'd have a run-in with

310
00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:54.400
the police as a child
i spent the next few weeks completely

311
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.280
uncoordinated and barely eating i lost
25 pounds which i was thrilled with but

312
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.480
it um but it also meant that i missed
the talent show

313
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.480
apparently grease lightning was a smash
hit mark's mom recorded it for me and

314
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.640
showed me when i was feeling up to
visiting

315
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.679
i was so proud of what we'd pulled off
and completely heartbroken that i

316
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:17.039
couldn't be there
i watched the tape of the whole talent

317
00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:20.720
show and our group was the only one that
got a standing ovation

318
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.919
apparently the principal was even
frustrated that he hadn't

319
00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:28.720
that we hadn't gone up last because
every act after us couldn't compete

320
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.720
i wanted to have a party for the whole
team but i never got to go back to

321
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.799
school that year may and june were meant
only for recovery

322
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:40.159
i was absolutely convinced that i was
going to fail the grade especially since

323
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:44.559
my fifth grade teacher had it out for me
but my mother had worked some magic and

324
00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:48.960
made sure i moved on to the sixth grade
we'll get to the teacher and his family

325
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.720
later
i spent the summer between sixth

326
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.480
between fifth and sixth grade visiting
my neurologist several times a month

327
00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.799
having blood work done every two weeks
and watching my parents marriage implode

328
00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:04.559
it had been on the rocks for a few years
as i'd later learned but my sudden

329
00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:08.080
medical issues were a straw that broke
the camel's back

330
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.200
both my parents were under immense
stress which was making it harder and

331
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.280
harder for them to make it work
they would get into fights all the time

332
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.039
sometimes over something as silly as the
wattage of a light bulb to buy

333
00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:22.080
i remember that argument particularly
well because it ended with a shattered

334
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.960
bulb and me being sequestered in my room
with my cat while my mom cleared up the

335
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.840
mess
by the end of the summer they were

336
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.520
sleeping in separate bedrooms my dad in
the master bedroom and my mom in the

337
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.760
computer room slash guest bedroom
when i wasn't dealing with doctors or

338
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.360
parents i'd made my escape to mark's
house since his mom was in nursing

339
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.280
school my parents felt comfortable with
me staying there for longer than a few

340
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.200
hours she made sure i took my meds on
time and i got to hang out with mark and

341
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.919
his gaggle of cousins that all lived
within three or four houses of each

342
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:55.120
other it was a great escape while it
lasted

343
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.400
running away to mark's house stopped
once the summer ended since mark's mom

344
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.080
was now in school full time and wouldn't
be around to keep an eye on me my mother

345
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.360
was still on edge about the nameless
[ __ ] that knocked me

346
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.960
that knocked the rock off the back of my
head

347
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.360
and keeping to her word had driven me to
and from school every single day

348
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.400
well my father drove me to school in the
morning and my mother picked me up in

349
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.200
the afternoon
no more homophobes throwing rocks at me

350
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.919
but as it turns out my brain didn't need
much of an excuse to go completely

351
00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.799
haywire
you see this was the fall of the year

352
00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:34.480
2000 and like any perfectly normal
elementary school kid i was completely

353
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.039
obsessed with the american presidential
election

354
00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:41.200
have i mentioned that i'm canadian
i watched all the debates and cnn became

355
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.880
my channel of choice in the evenings my
parents thought i was losing my mind and

356
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.640
sent me back to a therapist
back to a therapist yes we'll get to

357
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.400
that
so on the night of november 7th 2000 i

358
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.280
was absolutely glued to the tv in the
living room

359
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.039
eating chips and drinking soda like i
was watching wrestlemania

360
00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:02.720
my parents who were shut into their own
rooms looked in on me once in a while

361
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.320
but didn't interrupt or even tell me to
go to bed i'm sure they expected me to

362
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.039
fall asleep on the couch at some point
maybe once the election was called

363
00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:15.600
i stayed up all night long watching the
coverage literally sitting on the edge

364
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.960
of my seat praying to god above that
george w bush wouldn't win the election

365
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.880
i knew he was a homophobe and i had all
intentions on moving to the united

366
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.919
states for college so i couldn't have
the country devolving into a republican

367
00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:31.600
hellscape in the meantime so i had to be
there when al gore was announced the

368
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.559
winner
i didn't know much about gore oddly i

369
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:37.600
just knew that he wasn't bush and that's
all that mattered to me in my 11 year

370
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.799
old brain
i was still tuned in when the sun came

371
00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:44.559
up and my dad started to stir
he always woke up earlier than mom which

372
00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:47.200
is why he drove me to school in the
morning

373
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.919
you're back at the news huh he asked
assuming i'd slept at some point

374
00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:56.559
they still don't know who won i said how
can you run a country like that

375
00:23:56.559 --> 00:24:00.080
well it's time to get ready for school
eond go get dressed we'll get breakfast

376
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.600
at mcdonald's
i reluctantly left the television still

377
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.320
on but muted while i went to get well i
well i went and got changed and brushed

378
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.679
my teeth
i checked in again before we left just

379
00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:14.880
in case florida had gotten its [ __ ]
together but sadly no

380
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.080
so i went with my dad and had a hash
brown egg mcmuffin and apple juice for

381
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.880
breakfast
dad wanted to go in and eat but i was

382
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.679
but i convinced him to go through the
drive through so we could sit in the car

383
00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:27.679
and we could listen to the news on the
radio

384
00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:31.120
when we got to my school dad parked the
car and waited for me to get out but i

385
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.559
seemed completely entranced by the radio
i don't even remember getting to school

386
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:40.080
as it turns out lack of sleep and
epilepsy don't mix

387
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.159
according to my dad he asked me if i was
okay but i didn't respond

388
00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:47.919
he shook my shoulder but i went limp in
the seat and then fell into a complete

389
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:52.080
grand mal seizure foaming at the mouth
eyes rolled back body going rigid and

390
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.200
shaking the whole deal
we didn't have a cell phone so dad

391
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.880
rushed back to the house down the street
he carried me in and laid me on his bed

392
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.320
while my mother woke up and panicked
when she saw what was going on she

393
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.520
immediately called 9-1-1 and is out and
i was rushed to the general hospital

394
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.159
about 10 minutes away within an hour
when i still hadn't exited the seizure

395
00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:13.840
the order was made to transfer me to the
regional hospital my parents wanted to

396
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.520
go in the ambulance with me but they
would have to follow in their car

397
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.320
when i still hadn't exited the seizure
by the time my parents had reached the

398
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.919
regional hospital they were told by a
doctor to expect the worst

399
00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:27.440
at some point the seizure ended but
within minutes a new one started the

400
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.640
doctors hadn't even had time to tell my
parents before i started convulsing all

401
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.520
over again
my parents sat in the waiting room with

402
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.440
my neurologist family doctor and
pediatrician they'd all left their

403
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.600
practices when they heard i'd that i'd
been in a seizure for several hours

404
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.200
my neurologist took my parents aside to
tell them that when seizures last longer

405
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.400
than 10 to 15 minutes let alone this
long it can lead to severe brain damage

406
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.279
around nine o'clock that night i stopped
convulsing

407
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:57.200
but my heart also stopped
they tried the paddles but nothing was

408
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.799
working
i've been told that the doctor vocally

409
00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:05.360
sobbed when he declared my time of death
he was leaving the room to go tell my

410
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.640
parents when my heart of its own
volition

411
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.320
started up again
the seizures didn't start again and my

412
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.679
vitals stabilized
my parents were moments away from being

413
00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:20.400
told that their only child was dead but
i was too pig-headed to stay down

414
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.600
the doctors did however make it very
clear that i would likely have brain

415
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.919
damage
at the very least i would probably need

416
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.200
to relearn to walk and talk once i came
out of it

417
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.760
my parents were preparing for the worst
i didn't actually regain consciousness

418
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.600
until the next morning november 9 2000
i remember this as clear as day

419
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.480
my parents have been told to go home but
they refused and were sleeping in the

420
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.919
hallway
hello i called

421
00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:50.080
a young nurse rushed in tears in her
eyes followed by an older nurse

422
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.279
i'll get his parents the younger nurse
cheered when she saw me sitting up on my

423
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:56.400
own
hello the elder nurse said

424
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.039
you've been through a lot can you tell
me your name

425
00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:02.640
how old you are
my parents tore open the curtain

426
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.159
separating me from the rest of the er
and beamed at me my mom immediately

427
00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:10.080
hugged me while my dad tried and failed
to hide his tears mrs summerton please

428
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.880
step back the older nurse said and then
turn to me do you know your name how old

429
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.480
are you
i waved at her that doesn't matter

430
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.360
just please tell me bush didn't win the
election

431
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.120
my mother laughed through her tears
while the older nurse smiled and said

432
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.080
i think we can rule out brain damage
i spent the next eight days in the

433
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.600
hospital going through any number of
daily tests only surviving because the

434
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.159
hospital had a tv channel that was about
80 anime i'd watched all of dragon ball

435
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:41.600
z up to the arrival and namek by the
time that they let me out of there

436
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.240
i was being held because again i wasn't
eating and my neurologist refused to let

437
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.159
me leave until he saw me eat for himself
and keep it down

438
00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:54.799
my mother came up with a plan
she brought me popcorn chicken from kfc

439
00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:57.360
which i happily ate in front of the
doctors

440
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.600
i didn't throw it up either
so they relented and said that i could

441
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.760
go home the next morning
my dad showed up at the crack of dawn to

442
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.399
drive me home

443
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.679
chapter 3
future outlook unclear

444
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:21.520
for this chapter i'm going to change a
few names for reasons you'll soon

445
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.080
understand
but first up

446
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.919
context
as a little kid i wanted to be a doctor

447
00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:31.760
then once i entered school and found out
how much i liked arguing with teachers i

448
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.520
decided i wanted to be a lawyer
this shone through in my personality

449
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.360
very quickly in the first grade my
teacher decided that i was to play a cow

450
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.720
in the christmas pageant
and as a kid who had already been to see

451
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.960
a dietitian i did not take kindly to
being called a cow

452
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.600
the argument between he and i lasted for
most of december before i finally walked

453
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.399
out of the her walked out of the
rehearsal and marched right into the

454
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:58.640
principal's office to declare that mr
mcneill is calling me fat

455
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.080
the principal was appalled
when my teacher eventually explained the

456
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.240
situation she was a bit less stressed
and on her lunch break went to a costume

457
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.039
store and came back with a little set of
goat horns

458
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:12.159
there you go she said handing them to me
in front of the class you're not a cow

459
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:15.840
jimmy you're a goat now
thank you i said slipping the little

460
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.679
stuffed horns onto my head i looked at
my teacher and rolled my eyes was that

461
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:23.600
so hard
he hated me for the rest of the year

462
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.520
turns out he was also the nephew of some
other teachers in the school another mr

463
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.640
mcneil who taught fifth grade and his
wife mrs mcneill who taught fourth grade

464
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.880
when i entered mrs mcneill's fourth
grade class she glared at me

465
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.200
apparently not only had i been a brat to
or nephew a few years before but my

466
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.039
cousin had recently gotten into a
physical fight with her daughter which

467
00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:49.360
my cousin won
girls will be girls

468
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.799
so i had a target on my back as soon as
i walked through that door

469
00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:56.960
she wasn't even subtle about it so much
so that when i complained to my mom she

470
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.080
already knew because some parents had
called her to tell her that their kids

471
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.720
had told them how horrible the teacher
was being

472
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.960
my mom didn't want to let me know that
my mom didn't want to let me know just

473
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.440
yet because she didn't know how to
handle it

474
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.600
eventually we ended up in a meeting with
the principal myself my mom mrs mcneil

475
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.520
and five other students in my class who
testified on my behalf mrs mcneill's

476
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.799
only response was
are you really going to believe a bunch

477
00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:25.200
of kids
when she refused to apologize to me even

478
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.120
after being ordered to do so by the
principal my mother took me by the hand

479
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.039
and walked out
i spent two weeks being homeschooled

480
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.640
which i loved
my mom was a much better teacher than

481
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.240
that mcneil witch anyway
i even had a halloween party during my

482
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.000
sabbatical where even more classmates
told my mom about even more things

483
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.360
mcneil had done to me
some examples of her lovely behavior

484
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.000
were
not allowing me to do group projects

485
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.080
with my friends disqualifying me from
the book of book a week reading

486
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.080
competition because i read too fast not
letting me go to the principal's office

487
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.600
to get my inhaler
keeping me in during recess because i

488
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.399
tried answering too many questions etc
etc etc

489
00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:09.279
so when my mother eventually went to
another meeting with mcneil and the

490
00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:14.240
principal she came locked and loaded
eventually mcneil apologized and she did

491
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.360
get better
marginally

492
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.799
i didn't get punished for reading too
fast anymore but i was graded

493
00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:24.320
particularly harshly and she gave me my
first failing grade on a science test

494
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.279
near the end of the year
my mother made her let me rewrite it but

495
00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:30.559
still
the next year i walked into fifth grade

496
00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:35.679
to see mr mcneil
her husband

497
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:39.840
oh joy
he was much more subtle than his wife

498
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.919
had been mostly just grading me harshly
and refusing to pick me for questions

499
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:46.640
and then claiming i wasn't participating
in class

500
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.519
but by the end of the year once i'd
gotten the rock off the back of the head

501
00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:53.360
he was much more accommodating
he was the reason i was afraid

502
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.720
of failing fifth grade because of
missing the last two months

503
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.720
but i made it through into sixth grade
where i discovered that his wife got a

504
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.480
promotion and was now teaching sixth
grade

505
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.880
jesus h christ
the first few months of sixth grade

506
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.200
sucked heard which of course didn't get
any better after i was pronounced dead

507
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.039
from a seizure in early november
i was once again kept out of school for

508
00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:21.519
two months to recover which i could
which i couldn't have been more happy

509
00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.760
about
it had gotten to the point where going

510
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.919
to school was becoming a hell for me so
i was more than pleased to do two months

511
00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:31.519
of homeschooling
and since i've been losing my arguments

512
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:34.720
with these teachers for the last couple
of years i was really rethinking my plan

513
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.080
to be a lawyer
luckily a new plan popped into my little

514
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.120
head though
one night while my mom and i were

515
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.120
watching television a e aired a special
edition of their biography series

516
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.760
focusing on steven spielberg i'd always
loved movies but for some reason the

517
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.640
idea that people actually made movies
just never computed in my brain

518
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.039
but that night was like a revelation
seeing behind the scenes pictures and

519
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:03.519
footage from jaws indiana jones and
jurassic park made my eyes sparkle even

520
00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:08.960
more than the movies themselves
i want to make movies i told my mother

521
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.600
i thought you wanted to be a lawyer she
laughed

522
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.240
no i shook my head i want to do that
i turned back to the screen and didn't

523
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.159
turn away until the credits rolled
i checked the tv guide for a rerun as

524
00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:24.000
soon as it ended and set the vcr to
record it for me so i could watch it

525
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.919
over and over again
that christmas as my two months away

526
00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:32.480
from school was winding down i woke up
to find a black backpack under the tree

527
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.840
it was actually the last thing i went to
since i assumed it was for going back to

528
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.640
school
i had movies and toys and video games to

529
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.440
look at much more important than school
gear

530
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.279
eventually my mom prodded me
aren't you gonna look at the bag

531
00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:48.159
oh
i pretended to have not noticed

532
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:52.640
even as a kid i would have even as a kid
i would always react super happy no

533
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.000
matter what the gift was
when i picked the bag up i wasn't ready

534
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.679
for how heavy it would be
setting it down gently i opened it up to

535
00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:04.720
find a camcorder a collection of blank
tapes a full and a full-size vhs tape

536
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.399
that would let you put the
camcorder-sized tapes in into a vcr and

537
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:12.240
a book about how to write screenplays
i think my mom was letting me save the

538
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.440
best for last on purpose a damn near wet
myself

539
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.079
the camcorder was secondhand but i
didn't know that and it wouldn't have

540
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:23.119
mattered to me anyway this was my ticket
to being the next spielberg

541
00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:27.760
i immediately went about writing a movie
called the rise and fall of apocalypse

542
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.440
catchy title eh
i didn't realize it at the time but i

543
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.200
think i was working out my incredible
anxiety about the end of the world

544
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.240
you see in late 1998 i'd accidentally
spotted a rag magazine declaring january

545
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.240
1st 2000 to be the end of the world in a
convenience store and fell into a total

546
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.560
anxiety and panic spiral it didn't and
it didn't stop when y2k didn't melt the

547
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.599
world either
there was always a new excuse first it

548
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:56.720
was well actually 2001 is the start of
is the real start of the new millennium

549
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.079
and then the did you know our calendars
are actually four years off from the

550
00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:04.480
roman ones so the millennium isn't until
2004

551
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.760
and then 9 11 happened and
oh boy i spent weeks as a full-on mental

552
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.040
basket case assuming at any minute world
war iii would break out and we'd all be

553
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.119
nuked
i saw three different therapists tried

554
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:20.560
several different anti-anxiety meds none
of which worked

555
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.079
and this source of apocalyptic panic
never really went away

556
00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:28.560
i still get a twinge in my chest when
something particularly ominous happens

557
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.200
north korea being temperamental in 2017
actually sent me into a fit of physical

558
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:39.119
panic symptoms that lasted non-stop for
weeks and still visit once in a while

559
00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:43.200
but the rise and fall of apocalypse was
i think my way of dealing with it back

560
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.119
then
it was about a girl angela reed who came

561
00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:51.760
from a long line of scions who stopped
the multiple apocalypses that had been

562
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.839
predicted throughout history
apocalypse wasn't just an event but a

563
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:59.440
person
a long forgotten greek god the god of

564
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.160
ends beginnings and all that
accomplished them

565
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.839
who our heroine angela would fight back
with the help of her plucky group of

566
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:10.240
friends
by mid-january i had the script written

567
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.680
i cast my friends in all the parts and
we started shooting in the beginning of

568
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.720
february
who knew a little movie with my friends

569
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.599
could have ruined my life

570
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.280
the girl i cast in the lead part of
angela was named chansey like the

571
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.200
pokemon only not really this this is one
of those fake names

572
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.640
she and i had become fast friends in the
fall when she started dating my friend

573
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.680
mark dating in the sixth grade
essentially meant hanging out and

574
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.280
kissing sometimes i was the mediator of
their relationship she would tell me

575
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.720
what he was doing that was making her
mad which i would then translate to him

576
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.000
gently because i'd gotten pretty good at
that all the while thinking she should

577
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.280
just be happy to have him
but during my seizure break from school

578
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.040
they ended up breaking up
mark didn't tell me why and she wouldn't

579
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.839
either but i would eventually find out
that her mother who we'll call

580
00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:02.160
lilith
was batshit insane

581
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.160
so we were making a movie
chansey as well as my friends beverly

582
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.000
jillian carrie mark matt robert and
nathan would be over at the house almost

583
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.920
every day shooting i had no idea what i
was going to do with all this footage

584
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.119
since i didn't have the slightest clue
how to edit vhs tapes but i was

585
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:21.599
determined to get the movie in the can
and we did it we filled four tapes for a

586
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:25.680
total of eight hours worth of footage
before march break

587
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.800
during the break i spent most of my time
on the internet trying to figure out how

588
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.720
to edit vhs tapes which turned out to be
a complicated system of connecting two

589
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.440
vcrs and basically hitting pause and
record at the precisely right moments

590
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.560
i wasn't looking forward to that but i
planned on hijacking the vcr in the

591
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.480
living room taking it to my bedroom and
spending my evenings editing the movie

592
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.760
homework be damned
when march break ended and i went back

593
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.440
to school
and first when march break ended i went

594
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.280
back to school and for some reason
chancey was avoiding me

595
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.480
and a lot of other girls too
not the ones i was friends with like

596
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.560
beverly and carrie but most of the other
girls they would give me dirty looks and

597
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.119
scurry away when i asked what was wrong
all the girls seemed to know something

598
00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:11.200
that none of the guys did
this went on for about two weeks before

599
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.079
i got called down to the principal's
office one afternoon

600
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:19.359
what had i done was i in trouble
yes yes i was in trouble

601
00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:23.680
when i got down there i found my mother
the principal chancey lilith

602
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.440
and a police officer
i was informed that chansey had accused

603
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.599
me of sexually assaulting her
i had no idea how to respond to that i

604
00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:36.480
was completely and utterly dumbfounded
and as someone who rarely has nothing to

605
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.720
say that's saying something
and the cop read into it

606
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.359
what have you got to say for yourself he
demanded

607
00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:48.640
i didn't i began but he cut me off yeah
go on say you didn't do it go ahead

608
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.839
leave him the [ __ ] alone my mother
yelled wrapping her arm around my

609
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:56.160
shoulder he said he didn't do it that's
what they all say the cop responded

610
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.599
he's 12 years old my mother stated
firmly

611
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:03.520
doing a real crack up job raising him
then aren't you the cop said

612
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.920
i thought my mother's head was going to
blow off

613
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.400
chancy and lilith had yet to say a thing
the meeting ended soon with the

614
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.560
principal enduring the cop
insuring the cop and lilith that chancey

615
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.760
and i would be kept apart while the
investigation was underway

616
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.680
he should be expelled lilith spat at me
i still hadn't managed to get five words

617
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.920
out of my mouth i stayed silent all the
way home when we got into the kitchen my

618
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.760
mother sat down with me and asked very
matter-of-factly

619
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.400
did you do it
no

620
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.720
i stated i had literally never touched
chancy why would i had a mad crush on

621
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.920
her ex-boyfriend for heaven's sake
okay my mom said then we'll figure this

622
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.680
out
i didn't figure anything out i was kept

623
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.960
completely out of the loop because my
mother saw how immensely stressful this

624
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.320
was for me and didn't want to trigger
another seizure

625
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.359
lilith wouldn't take her calls and so
she had to deal exclusively with the

626
00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:02.000
cops who were nothing if not total
pricks the police were 100 convinced

627
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.599
that not only had i done it but that
there were probably other girls i'd

628
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:08.400
assaulted who were too scared to come
forward

629
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.839
my mother told him i was gay and they
just laughed at her

630
00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:15.040
the story was that i had apparently
sexually assaulted chancy while we were

631
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.160
filming the movie but she didn't tell
her mom until

632
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.599
about it until march break because she
was too embarrassed

633
00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:26.480
again for the record
i never even so much as high-fived her

634
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.319
it was her word against mine and the
cops had already decided whose word was

635
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:34.560
gospel they were actually preparing to
charge me with sexual sexual assault

636
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.800
when mark's mom cindy had an
idea they said it was while they were

637
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.400
making the movie right
she asked my mom one night she was on

638
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.079
speakerphone and i was listening outside
the door flat out over being left out of

639
00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.440
my own defense
yeah my mom said

640
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.440
well you said jimmy never stopped
recording cindy pointed out

641
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.160
so beyond the tapes if she's telling the
truth

642
00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.240
i rushed into my room grabbed the tapes
and barged into my mom's room i've got

643
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.079
proof i proclaimed
the next day cindy came up with mark and

644
00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:07.200
they along with my mother and i sat
around the television in the living room

645
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.280
watching all eight hours of footage
i never stepped out from behind that

646
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.599
camera
that lying little [ __ ] mark huffed

647
00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:20.480
both of her mother scolded him but
kind of nodded in agreement i knew you

648
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.160
didn't do it mark said before hannah
before him and his mom left the that

649
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.800
evening
and then he hugged me

650
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.960
mark and i had never hugged
least of all since i'd come out

651
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.720
but in that moment i wasn't getting a
hug from my crush i was getting a hug

652
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.119
from my best friend
my mom and cindy took the tapes to the

653
00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:42.640
cops where they spent another eight
hours reviewing them

654
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.000
the cops kept the tapes saying that they
needed further review

655
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.240
about three weeks later a cop car pulled
into our driveway on a sunday and three

656
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.079
officers came to the door
my mother let them in and we all sat

657
00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:58.400
around the kitchen table my father
silent with rage as they spoke

658
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.359
you're lucky one said to me
chances decided not to file charges

659
00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:06.960
my mother sighed and pointed at the cop
i told you he didn't do it

660
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.560
chansey never said he didn't do it the
cop said she and her mother just didn't

661
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.079
want to ruin his life
so you should thank them because i never

662
00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:17.040
would have let up if someone assaulted
my daughter

663
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.680
he didn't assault anyone my father
bellowed making me jump in my chair

664
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.680
keep your voice down mr summerton the
[ __ ] cop said

665
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.800
they didn't stick around much longer
only long enough to inform me that

666
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.800
they'd be keeping the tapes as evidence
in case chansey changed her mind

667
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.920
my mother was so relieved she was in
tears as they left

668
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.280
i was relieved
but also angry

669
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.839
they stole my movie
years later i ended up having to sit

670
00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:47.200
next to chancey on the bus home from
school in junior high

671
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.560
by this time i'd been seizure free for a
few years and no one had so much has

672
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.960
called me queer so my mom was a bit more
relaxed with how i got to

673
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.720
with how i got home from school though i
was still driven in the morning

674
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.960
when chancy sat next to me i thought my
heart was going to explode i didn't move

675
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.079
i stared out the window in silence for a
good 15 minutes before she spoke

676
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:11.599
i'm sorry she said
i didn't say anything i just slowly

677
00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:15.760
looked over at her
what happened in elementary she said

678
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.119
that wasn't me
my mom was so angry she thought because

679
00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:22.960
you and i spent a lot of time together
that we must be fooling around i told

680
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.319
her i didn't like you that way and she
decided that meant you'd done something

681
00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:31.280
without my permission
so you never said that i did

682
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.640
that
i said i was biting my tongue so hard i

683
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.160
could taste blood the bumpy road wasn't
helping

684
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.440
nah never she said
i'm glad your mom fixed it all

685
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.040
turns out lilith had gotten pregnant
with chancey when she was just out of

686
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.760
elementary school so assumed her
daughter would be getting up to the same

687
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.119
things as her
it's what scared mark away when he and

688
00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:56.000
chansey were dating
apparently she never calmed down about

689
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.119
it either forcing chancy into an
all-girls catholic high school when the

690
00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:03.760
time came a school that was an hour's
drive away from where they lived

691
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.839
i was told she wouldn't let her have her
own cell phone wouldn't let her go to

692
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:11.040
sleepovers and wouldn't let her go on
birth control even though chancey's

693
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.480
doctor wanted her on the pill because of
medical issues

694
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.760
i don't know what happened to her after
that she fell out of touch with the

695
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.280
friends we had in common and ended up
being blacklisted by every boy in our

696
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.240
junior high once they found out what had
happened to me

697
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.800
none of them would go anywhere near her
not even his friends

698
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.880
it's sad really
she actually was victimized just not by

699
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.359
me
but by her mother i hope she's out there

700
00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:41.280
somewhere
now doing okay

701
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.720
okey-dokey so that's the end of chapter
three

702
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.599
um
[Music]

703
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:55.920
i figure i'll leave off there
since that's a lot to chew on um

704
00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.800
yeah let me know what you think let me
know if it's worth writing more of

705
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.319
um because i am not
confident in my ability to write prose

706
00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:11.119
