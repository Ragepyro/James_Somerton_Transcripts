00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
since it premiered in 2013 the attack on
Titan anime has been called the greatest

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
anime ever produced the most overrated
anime ever produced and the most

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.539
dangerous anime ever produced but which
opinion is right maybe just maybe

4
00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.779
they're all wrong I didn't watch Attack
on Titan at first because I was in my

5
00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.199
anime as for kids phase and only really
got into it earlier this year when

6
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.320
countless people online were telling me
how gay the relationship between Levi

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.759
and arabin was after watching the show
I have no idea what they were talking

8
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.200
about I don't see gay going on anywhere
between these two Historia and Emir yes

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
obviously Emir loudly proclaimed that
she wanted to marry Historia Jean and

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.860
Marco absolutely in my mind they loved
each other but Marco didn't live long

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.980
enough to see anything come of it but
Levi and Ervin

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.760
I just don't see it but even though I
didn't see the gayness your ship is

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
valid regardless I still found myself
becoming utterly transfixed by this show

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.980
to the point where I ended up watching
all 87 episodes in about three days but

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.180
not everyone is so in love with the
series the show and manga on which its

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.420
base have been attacked for portraying
the eldians the race of people who live

17
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.159
inside the walls as an analog for Jewish
people and since eldians can turn into

18
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
man-eating monsters something Jewish
people have been accused of being able

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
to do in the past believe it or not the
analogous connection has made more than

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.479
a few people uneasy the fact that actual
white nationalists have tried to embrace

21
00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.360
Attack on Titan as a story that
expresses their Theory the Jews are

22
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.299
purposefully oppressing and attempting
to eliminate European people through

23
00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.299
Mass migration and brainwashing hasn't
helped the show's defense many of these

24
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.920
people are embracing it not for its
representation of a Jewish analogy as

25
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
fighting to survive against a much
larger Force but as a defense of white

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.939
nationalism the they seem to see the
opposite of what normal fans see they

27
00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.180
see themselves as the oppressed eldians
while the oppressing Marlins are the

28
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.720
Jewish analog to them because they
failed every media literacy course they

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.780
ever took but they still gravitate
toward the story nonetheless which many

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
find problematic I say we shouldn't be
letting the alt-right take ownership of

31
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.300
well anything but that's me so yeah
Attack on Titan is handling incredibly

32
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500
charged issues and bringing some
extremely radical people into its midst

33
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.860
some of whom appear to be rooting for
the mass genocide at the end of the

34
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.360
story rather than realizing that every
lead character -1 from the first three

35
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760
seasons sees it as awful and wrong most
of the show's principles are articulated

36
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.780
in a clumsy Manner and it's clear why
some people have been alarmed by how

37
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.920
it's portrayed that doesn't excuse
people from not being fair to the show

38
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
simply because some members of the
alt-right enjoy it in some ways though

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.200
Attack on Titan may not be inherently
fascist but it speaks to a fascist urge

40
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
in Attack on Titan the nature of
oppressor and oppressed is fluid and

41
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.319
ambiguous the humanity stuck between
those who assume these identities don't

42
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.459
really recognize or comprehend them when
their skulls are crushed and the

43
00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.180
survivors reflect on watching their
loved ones perish in agony all that is

44
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.840
left of our life stories are the deeply
personal horrors of humankind's

45
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
inhumanity toward other humans and the
horror that your precious life can be

46
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.019
drained from your body in an instant by
forces you do not even comprehend so

47
00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.500
let's bite into this world let's rip
open the nape of its neck and see what's

48
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.580

operation to recapture shaganchana

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.860
Armin who is nearly killed by the
Colossal Titan but Armin is turned into

110
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.460
a Titan himself and acquires ownership
of the Colossal Titan by eating Bertolt

111
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.580
while Ervin dies in a suicide run
against the Beast Titan and is then at

112
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.060
least partially Avenged by Levi being
the absolute biggest badass of bad asses

113
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.419
then Aaron and his comrades returned to
the ruins of his child own where they

114
00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.900
learn the truth about their world that
they are aliens sworn opponents of the

115
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.900
imperialist Marlins and were imprisoned
within the walls after the original King

116
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.560
Fritz fled the conflict they are not as
they were informed the last people alive

117
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.539
but rather a small sect of eldians on an
isolated island called parody over the

118
00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.539
course of the next year the survey corps
kill all the remaining pure Titans on

119
00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:52.259
the island and for the first time in
their lifetimes make it to the Sea where

120
00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.340
Aaron resolves to wipe out the enemies
across the water season 4 part 1 the

121
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.520
what happened to my favorite character
season across the sea Marley continues

122
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.220
to oppress their eldian population
treating them like dirt turning them

123
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.340
into mindless Titans and sending them to
fight Wars of expansion for them and

124
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.099
brainwashing most of them into thinking
that they're evil and can only be

125
00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.620
Redeemed by becoming a Titan and
fighting for them three years after

126
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.440
killing off the last of the Titans on
parody the survey corps attacked

127
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.860
Marley's Capital Liberia led by Aaron
and his half-brother Zeke the Beast

128
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.280
Titan Aaron kills Willie Tiber an eldian
who had been controlling Marley from the

129
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.300
shadows and takes custody of the until
now unseen War Titan after eating its

130
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.840
former owner Willie's sister Lara Aaron
had infiltrated Marley and gained the

131
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.780
trust of several of its citizens before
this leaving his friends in the dark as

132
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.779
to where he was or what he was doing so
once the attack is over and Aaron is

133
00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.959
back home he is imprisoned but escapes
with the help of a group of fanatical

134
00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:40.620
soldiers who have dedicated themselves
to Aaron known as the jagerists Zeke who

135
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.740
is revealed to have Royal Blood and
therefore special Titan abilities is

136
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.459
imprisoned by Levi but manages to escape
but not before Levi does some serious

137
00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:51.540
damage to him meanwhile Marley's air
fleet led by Reiner launches an attack

138
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.560
on parity season 4 part 2 the exposition
season Aaron and Zeke managed to come

139
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.100
together which takes them to the paths
an interconnected set of gateways

140
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.160
connecting all the subjects of Emir
through time and space where they

141
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.820
encounter the mind of Emir the original
Titan not the lesbian Emir a different

142
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.880
one whose tortured past has kept her in
prison for thousands of years within the

143
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.540
path bill ing the world's Titans head of
sand one by one Zeke tries to persuade

144
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.019
Amir to Grant his request of sterilizing
all the subjects of Emir her descendants

145
00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:19.200
therefore ending the Titan threat
forever and ending the suffering of all

146
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.860
aliens however Aaron persuades Amir
instead to unleash the rumbling letting

147
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.740
loose those thousands of colossal-like
Titans held within the walls of parody

148
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.220
and guiding them on a genocidal march to
slaughter everyone outside the island to

149
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.519
stop Aaron's maniacal Mission the former
leadership of the survey corps joins

150
00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:36.180
forces with the remaining marlian forces
including Reiner and a decrystallized

151
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.160
Annie season 4 part 3 the manga ending
and maybe anime ending season after an

152
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.000
apocalyptic battle atop Aaron's Elder
Torah of a final form Levi kills Zeke in

153
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.940
a mysterious monster that is the source
of all the Titan's Powers leaving Mika

154
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.060
said to kill Aaron causing the Titans
power to vanish and release every person

155
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.940
who had been transformed into a Titan
it's revealed that what happened was

156
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.080
part of Aaron's plan all along because
he could see the future and the past and

157
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.200
was basically omniscient there for a bit
as the rest of the world is rebuilding

158
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.279
Armin and his comrades begin peace talks
led by Queen Historia Mikasa berries

159
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.700
Aaron beneath a tree on a hill in
Chicago District but over time the world

160
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.779
does not see peace instead only new
forms of warfare as is the nature of

161
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.959
humankind their home District of Chicago
has turned to Rubble in one such

162
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.500
conflict and the series concludes with a
boy approaching the giant tree that has

163
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.680
grown around Aaron's grave which Bears a
striking resemblance to the tree in

164
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.279
which Emir connected with the progenitor
of the Titan's power Millennia ago all

165
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:30.300
right clear as mud makes a lot more
sense while you're watching or reading

166
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.420
it if you're interested in a breakdown
that focuses more on the emotional beats

167
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.600
of the story check out totally not
Mark's Colossal Titan review video it's

168
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.640
long but totally worth the watch okay
now let's talk about the drama

169
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.339
to a large extent people started feeling
uneasy about Attack on Titan once the

170
00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:53.760
manga explained the Titan's Origins
finally answering the series spanning

171
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.839
question what is in Aaron's family's
House's basement Aaron's father Grisha

172
00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:01.079
left behind a journal outlining that the
outside world

173
00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:05.940
isn't uninhabited at all that there is a
wide world out beyond the walls the

174
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.320
people of parity are of a race called
eldians All of whom have the ability to

175
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.519
transform into Titans under certain
circumstances who are the descendants of

176
00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:19.380
the first Titan Emir and in this outside
world eldians are corralled into ghettos

177
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.620
and forced to wear armbands to
distinguish them they spend their lives

178
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.040
being told how their Titan ancestors
ruled the world with an Iron Fist and

179
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.640
that they must atone for the sins of
their tyrannical ancestors regardless of

180
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.180
the fact that there isn't really any
proof that said eldian empire ever

181
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.019
actually existed its existence is only
spoken of by people who would have been

182
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:41.459
told about it via anti-eldian propaganda
regardless the people of Marley the

183
00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:45.360
continent across the Shores from parity
constantly fear the reprisal of this

184
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.019
mythical eldian war machine where the
wicked eldians from parody will rise up

185
00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:53.339
and use the power of the Titans to rule
or destroy the world once more so ldns

186
00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:57.360
in Marley who live inside ghettos must
toil in labor to prove that they aren't

187
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.560
like the Devils from within the walls of
parody Aaron's father held different

188
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.700
philosophy that the founding Titan Emir
was actually a benevolent goddess she

189
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.959
used her Titan blood to carve roads
erect Grand buildings and defend her

190
00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:13.800
people from the interloping forces and
that it was the people of Marley who

191
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.420
jealously seized the power of the Titans
castamere's descendants away and forged

192
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.500
a false history of propaganda to
suppress those eldians who did not flee

193
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.940
to parody Grisha Yeager believed that
the eldians were not Devils but the

194
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.779
chosen people of God which in
euro-american rhetoric chosen people of

195
00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:34.560
God carries a very specific meaning and
in conjunction with the ghettos and

196
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.279
armbands there seems to be a direct
comparison this leads some viewers who

197
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:43.680
interpret this storyline as being too
similar to anti-semitic conspiracies

198
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.860
which typically assert the Jewish people
govern the world via some sort of

199
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.899
ancient illuminati-esque cabal for
instance there is a well-respected LDN

200
00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:55.620
family in Marley The tibers Who owe
their honorary Marley and status to

201
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.160
their role in driving the LDN royalty
away from the cotton into 100 years ago

202
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.320
and though they may be eldian the Tiber
family has for Generations use their

203
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.980
wealth and influence to manipulate
global politics which may mirror

204
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.519
real-world conspiracies that say that
secret Jewish organizations already

205
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:16.139
secretly Run the World this facet of the
show has helped others such as dot

206
00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:20.940
pixis's character to stand out the
Creator and writer Hajime asiyama has

207
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.600
said that the character of Pixis a
military General was based on the real

208
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.399
life World War II General akiyama
yoshifuru who isiyama said he respected

209
00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:33.180
and is revered by many in Japan despite
having committed war crimes particularly

210
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.339
in Korea isayama's statement about this
which came from a 2010 blog post before

211
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:42.320
Attack on Titan was published led to
death threats against the author because

212
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.100
everything leads to death threats these
days which ends up delegitimizing your

213
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.579
argument because no matter what he
believes you threatened to kill him so

214
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:53.880
now he's the victim and before you turn
around and say how dare he commit war

215
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.079
crimes please examine how we white
westerners prop up the likes of Winston

216
00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:01.800
Churchill who ignored the deaths of
three million East Indian and then

217
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.480
British subjects and other figures like
American president Teddy Roosevelt who

218
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.600
said I don't go so far as to think that
the only good Indians are the dead

219
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.380
indians but I believe nine out of every
10 are and I shouldn't like to inquire

220
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.399
too closely into the case of the tenth
we take for granted that their pillars

221
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.760
of our culture because they gave a
speech or something regardless that they

222
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.720
were privy to massacres in genocide in
our own culture there is such an air of

223
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.680
veneration around these figures the
criticism is almost a cultural Taboo

224
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.779
it's not uncommon for creators to have
problematic views ones which are rooted

225
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:38.160
in their own cultural upbringing even
leftists give a pass to FDR as being a

226
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.639
great president and ignore the fact that
he locked up hundreds of thousands of

227
00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:46.560
Japanese Americans during World War II
but nobody calls him a fascist

228
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.040
well Republicans might but not for the
right reasons some have even gone so far

229
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.880
as to call Attack on Titan itself
fascist and anti-semitic because while

230
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.220
Attack on Titan does have a large fandom
of normal people it also has a notable

231
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.720
and Loud right-wing fan base the new
Republic even dubbed it the alt-right's

232
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.779
favorite manga anime fans have gotten
themselves into a tangle trying to

233
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.920
decipher where asayama dries the line
between the metaphors he engages in and

234
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.459
his own personal convictions but Attack
on Titan contradicts this ayama's

235
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:18.300
apparent nationalism would Armin not be
as put off by the alt-right adopting the

236
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.440
anime as he is by the actually very
fascist jagerists bearing in mind that

237
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.860
all the main characters in the show end
up fighting against Aaron's imperialist

238
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.899
march across the world in the end to me
this raises an important question

239
00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:35.040
if the alt-right is under the impression
that a piece of media is for them

240
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.940
are we just gonna roll over and let them
have it with content like

241
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.500
say Fight Club should we just relinquish
this media because the right famously

242
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.160
has such poor media literacy that they
do not realize it's actually making a

243
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.639
mockery of them the novel on which the
film is based was written by Chuck

244
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:55.440
palahnuk a gay author whose career is
marked by satire and subversion he

245
00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.000
sought to criticize toxic masculinity by
first pointing out how inherently gay

246
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.740
masculinity and Firming rituals actually
are and secondly by highlighting that

247
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.120
the boys will go to any lengths to prove
their masculinity the message of Fight

248
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.899
Club is not that boys should not talk
about Fight Club it's that maybe boys

249
00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:16.380
should talk about their feelings or else
they might be persuaded to commit

250
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.560
domestic terrorism instead of fighting
for this media's direct subtextual

251
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.820
meaning and holding on to it in spite of
the right wing following we just roll

252
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.839
over and let them add another piece of
media to their Library the problem being

253
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:32.519
the larger this collection of lib owning
content grows the more credible they

254
00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:36.779
feel alternately and This concerns me
I've begun to wonder if the left also

255
00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:40.680
lacks the media literacy needed to
properly gauge that fight Club is

256
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.980
specifically subverting the values and
sensibilities that the protagonists

257
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.279
represent an unfortunate Trend I've
noticed specifically in American Film

258
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:51.839
criticism is that analysts don't seem to
understand that they're not always meant

259
00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:55.259
to identify with the values of the main
character just because they're the main

260
00:16:55.259 --> 00:17:00.060
character sometimes the protagonist is
the villain as is the case with the

261
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.540
nameless protagonist of Fight Club but
is this the case with Aaron Jaeger

262
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.339
especially as the series reaches its
apocalyptic conclusion as Attack on

263
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:13.500
Titan comes to a close the question
becomes how to interact with it and also

264
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.280
whether or not a show can handle fascist
ideas in the manner with which it does

265
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.720
without being fascist and anti-semitic
itself isayama declined to comment on

266
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.380
the topic saying being a writer I
believe it is impolite to instruct your

267
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.100
readers the way of how to read your
story a large portion of the anime

268
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.480
Community as a generic group hold Attack
on Titan with very high regard you've

269
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.299
probably seen some of the show's
recognizable symbols especially its

270
00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:39.780
military insignia even if you haven't
seen the anime or read the Manga it's

271
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.380
based on if anything you've probably
heard portions of the iconic first

272
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.059
season theme song which is a banger

273
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.860
[Music]
to introduce many people to anime and

274
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.760
manga which is what makes criticism so
tricky it's hard to criticize one's

275
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.299
First Love however being unable or
unwilling to address the problems in

276
00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:05.400
Attack on Titan's fictional world has
caused a long simmering unresolved

277
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.320
conflict within the anime fandom

278
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.640
and Titan seems like it could be easily
written off as plainly pro-fascist the

279
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.900
central character is a pro-military
fanatic who uses his Pariah status to

280
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.380
justify mass extinction the militarism
of the story is reflected in the opening

281
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.980
sequence of the anime's first season
with the lyric I am a soldier granted

282
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.820
when it comes to All Things fashion and
Attack on Titan viewers always have to

283
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.880
read into it characters never
specifically come out and talk about

284
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.380
fascism either methods or ideology in
specific terms this may include

285
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.620
discussion about oppression
indoctrination propaganda and

286
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.160
dehumanization of a national enemy and
while all of these elements may be

287
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.799
deployed in a fascist regime they are
not exclusive to Fascism in fact not all

288
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:56.340
fascism is the same the term is often
deployed against things that

289
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.059
specifically draw from the posturing and
methodology of the Third Reich though

290
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:03.960
while it is true to say that all Nazis
were fascist

291
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.799
not all fascists were Nazis that said
when it comes to the specific elements

292
00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:10.919
of Attack on Titan that are implicitly
drawn from the Third Reich these

293
00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:14.640
elements are mostly visual the LDN
ghettos and Marley are never called

294
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.840
ghettos for instance we pick up on that
from the way they directly resemble

295
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.100
ghettos from the 30s and 40s when it
comes to what is written the depiction

296
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.660
of fascism is much more generalized
routinely dialogue leans toward valuing

297
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.740
People based on how they can serve the
military this is present in both the

298
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.940
forces of parody and Marley what good
you are to society is dependent upon how

299
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.780
you can advance the agenda of the state
however the bulk of the show's latent

300
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.700
fascist moralization is focused on Erin
Yeager and especially his Cult of

301
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.820
Personality the jagerists this is a
group that grew out of a branch of the

302
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.120
military specifically the branch that
had been depicted heroically from the

303
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.840
first three seasons the survey corps the
scouts themselves were depicted as

304
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.919
Plucky desperate dreamers they reached
for the impossible and they kept getting

305
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:03.720
up no matter how bad they got beaten
down time and time again this is a

306
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.460
common an underdog Trope in itself and
is not out of place among contemporary

307
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.360
pop culture however as Aaron became a
more pivotal figure to the survey corps

308
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.840
victories even though Aaron himself was
often ancillary many within the survey

309
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.500
corps and parody as a whole come to
venerate him and his agenda just as

310
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.900
season 4 doubles down on fascistic
undertones it perhaps begins to explore

311
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.580
the finer points of fishistic ideology
within fascism there is typically a

312
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.220
belief that death is the most
significant contribution that one can

313
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.000
make to society which has brought up
multiple times throughout seasons one

314
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.020
two and three in many fascist states
there is a warrior mythology around

315
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:45.120
seeking out a worthy death a worthy
death is almost always a death which is

316
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.140
of assistance to the reigning leadership
this is a component of why white

317
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.000
nationalists often lean into Norse
mythology as it goes entry into Valhalla

318
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.080
is earned through A Warrior's death
dying in battle the most common way to

319
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.059
die in battle was to be in an army

320
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.940
this isn't to say that all Nordic
culture itself was fascist the concept

321
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.780
of a good death was a religious one that
spanned across the whole culture rather

322
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.919
than in service to a single ruler that
isn't to say that rulers would not

323
00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:21.299
exploit this but the purpose of a good
death was intrinsic rather than

324
00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:25.020
appealing to a concept of the greater
good rhetoric around the greater good

325
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:30.360
itself is a pivotal element of Attack on
Titan and especially in season 4 we see

326
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.900
otherwise identifiable characters
committing atrocities in the name of the

327
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.840
greater good such as the once relatively
innocent Arman Aaron himself befits a

328
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.799
mythological Warrior status a figure who
is seemingly Supernatural powers and

329
00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:47.700
whose objectives are unwaveringly
aligned with the defense or expansion of

330
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.600
the Homeland the warrior must possess
the characteristics that the state wants

331
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.100
the collective to embody however the
discourse on deathworthiness is not

332
00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.179
limited to one side of this fictional
conflict and an interpretation of Aaron

333
00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:03.539
depends on whether the series is
depicting him sympathetically

334
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:08.400
or critically some may interpret Aaron
as a heroic figure who is making the

335
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.840
tough but necessary decision to do what
needs to be done some interpret him as a

336
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.280
national figure who is returning A
persecuted Nation to its former glory to

337
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.000
others he is super Hitler these
viewpoints are represented by different

338
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.659
characters in the story and they can be
found on very different sides of the

339
00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:29.700
conflict but there's very little framing
to moralize this specifically it seems

340
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.880
to be taken for granted that Aaron's
actions are evil

341
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.799
or necessary while Aaron himself is
fascist coded and while his cult the

342
00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:42.000
jagerists are brazenly Fascist
does that mean the show itself is

343
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.720
fascist Aaron was after all the POV
character who is more or less the

344
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.940
audience's cipher for the beginning of
the series

345
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.659
but it's important to remember that the
protagonist of a story is not

346
00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:56.340
necessarily the hero literally speaking
a protagonist is simply the character

347
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.640
For Whom The Narrative follows given
that Aaron is committing a literal

348
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.720
genocide I think it's safe to reason
that he is the series's principal

349
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.280
villain this narrative device isn't
uncommon a hero who uses their power to

350
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.419
become a monster is a plot device from
Frank Herbert's Dune it's present in the

351
00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:16.679
Star Wars prequels and can even be seen
in ancient myths like Heracles when

352
00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:21.480
gauging weather Attack on Titan itself
is fascist it comes down to how these

353
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.679
characters are framed and the consensus
in Attack on Titan from literally every

354
00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:31.440
other main character is that Aaron
maybe needs to chill bearing in mind

355
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.919
that detractors of the series point out
that the principal characters of Armin

356
00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:38.880
and Mikasa Aaron's childhood friends
attempt to justify his actions at the

357
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.780
end of the series that said we don't
have to look at them as heroic either

358
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:48.679
Armin had been dropping fascist adjacent
Lions since season one

359
00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:55.320
monsters we have to abandon our Humanity
which itself almost sounds like a direct

360
00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.240
quote from a beer hall speech and Mikasa
is so obsessed with Aaron to the point

361
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.480
of being completely incapable of
escaping him at the end of the manga

362
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.559
isayama punctuated that by having a bird
land on her shoulder and lift her scarf

363
00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:11.580
over her neck Justice Aaron said he
would always be there to do

364
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.679
she is trapped for the rest of her life
by the very memory of him that should

365
00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:19.679
not excuse these characters for sure
they are letting personal feelings Cloud

366
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:22.980
their judgment of someone who is very
obviously willing and able to commit

367
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.580
genocide with so many main characters
joining into these sentiments which if

368
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.700
they are not fascists they are certainly
violent ones does the audience have a

369
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.080
character with whom their viewpoints are
meant to be reflected except maybe Jean

370
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.260
he doesn't really do anything horrible
during the series even Historia while

371
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.240
inclined towards acts of kindness is
indicative of the rightful ruler Trope

372
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.960
in fiction which ends up itself
amounting to royalist propaganda and

373
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.580
while fascism is not defined by the lack
of democracy monarchy and oligarchy

374
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.460
aren't really that much better and while
the day is saved from the bad Monarch a

375
00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.679
good Monarch is still totalitarian
nevertheless how do we read that how do

376
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:04.799
we read any of this
because especially when it comes to the

377
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:09.360
aforementioned fascistic coating there
seems to be no clear pattern for how

378
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.559
these coded messages play out in the
plot sometimes a character's death

379
00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:17.820
yields opportunity
other times it's just a pointless

380
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.760
Slaughter
sometimes military decorum and

381
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.940
discipline holds the line and keeps the
group together

382
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.620
other times it functions as cultish
indoctrination these themes are so fast

383
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.919
and loose in the series that I can see
the evidence for where some people could

384
00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:36.240
read it as fascist and others could read
it as specifically anti-fascist and it's

385
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.520
not like fascist-esque imagery and Anime
and manga is rare on the subject anime

386
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.320
YouTuber Joe Yang said it's important to
note that the use of fascistic war or

387
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.840
even Nazi imagery is not necessarily an
endorsement of these ideas or regimes as

388
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.279
strange as it may sound the fascist and
anti-semitic elements in Attack on Titan

389
00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:59.520
shouldn't be controversial to bring up
the question the audience and the

390
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.299
critics need to answer is whether or not
the series is actively harmful because

391
00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:07.679
of them that is whether the audience is
directed to sympathize with characters

392
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:12.960
and themes that represent and are
represented by these elements some media

393
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.440
commentators even admitted to not
watching Attack on Titan because they

394
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.380
were afraid of the backlash they would
receive for discussing the show's

395
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.400
political undertones YouTuber Jeff THU
argues it's because this discussion

396
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.799
keeps happening but it's also not
there's some really good criticism of

397
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:32.220
Attack on Titan and I think it's
important to criticize it but a lot of

398
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.299
people come at it strong and condemn it
that does as much to kill the

399
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:39.779
conversation as people being like shut
the hell up about politics

400
00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:43.559
because it reinforces the argument that
people are just trying to cancel this

401
00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:47.940
good show that you like for a long time
anime fans had no way of knowing what

402
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.760
their favorite writers and artists even
looked like let alone what they thought

403
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.640
about the world anime fans have
generally avoided discussing the

404
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.760
political content of their favorite
shows because the art form was until

405
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.900
recently a niche that was sometimes
wrongly characterized as being obscene

406
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.980
and dangerous given the cultural status
in Japan of Animation as a medium and

407
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.820
not a genre there are venues for
animation to receive prestigious Acclaim

408
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.900
that is typically denied to animation in
America the equivalent of rejecting all

409
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.880
anime due to sweeping generalizations is
like shunning all live-action movies

410
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.980
because porn is also live action Andrea
horbinski a scholar with a doctorate in

411
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.720
New Media studies in history said some
anglophone and American anime fans say

412
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.260
that politics in anime is too foreign to
comprehend

413
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.159
a lot more people these days seem to
have some accurate knowledge about the

414
00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:40.500
socio-cultural politics in Japan but in
my experience they're equally likely to

415
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.220
combine a dollop of knowledge about
current circumstances in Japan with

416
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.720
their own preconceptions about Japan and
Japanese Society ironically while it's

417
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.320
never been easier to access cultural and
political discussions directly from

418
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.460
Japan thanks to the internet relying on
their own preconceptions and only taking

419
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:01.500
on board information that supports them
definitely does keep anime fans in this

420
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.500
position from appreciating the range of
views in anime generally this may color

421
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.279
certain anime viewers perceptions of
shows with feminist or queer themes as

422
00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:15.120
well as shows like Attack on Titan
right-wing anime viewers according to

423
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.620
herbinsky demand the inclusion of
western-style political themes as they

424
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.840
put it these fans insist that feminism
and lgbtq people don't exist in Japan

425
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.279
and that any anime depicting either is
woke garbage or similar these fans are

426
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:32.039
extremely angry at attempts to
discussion addictions of female

427
00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:35.760
characters in anime as something that
could often use Improvement or the

428
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.020
inclusion of LGBT characters period they
may cite evidence to support their views

429
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.400
that is wholly out of context attempts
by Japanese feminists and lgbtq

430
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.299
activists to provide corrective
information online do not go down well

431
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:52.500
particularly on Twitter which is funny
because these kinds of regressionists

432
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.299
Praise anime for its narrative
complexity but at the same time deny the

433
00:28:57.299 --> 00:29:01.500
presence of political complexity at
least when it's politics that challenges

434
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.520
their preconceptions again we're in a
situation where media being political

435
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.779
only really applies to media that
promotes opinions outside the viewer's

436
00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:13.620
comfort zone regardless if that media as
Attack on Titan does borrows heavily

437
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.820
from Real World politics and historical
references there is a contingent of the

438
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.600
audience who is so over accustomed to
having their viewpoints unchallenged

439
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.059
that they will default to an assumption
that the media they enjoy is simple and

440
00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:32.279
uncomplicated
but the question remains

441
00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:38.299
does media owe you
simplicity

442
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.600
huh

443
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.520
why am I suddenly wearing different
clothes and in a whole other setting for

444
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.059
part four
that seems a bit jarring doesn't it oh

445
00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:58.559
well you can't really say that attack on
Titan is overly simple or about nothing

446
00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:02.399
there are innumerous instances where
characters go out of their way to

447
00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:06.120
specifically outline what the audience
should be taking away from a given Arc

448
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.559
at least in the English dub which may
not be the best way to convey messaging

449
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:14.880
across to your audience if you treat
people like they're too dumb to pick up

450
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.600
on what's going on they won't develop
the tools needed to read into messaging

451
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.820
in other media people become how you
treat them which in itself could be a

452
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.440
theme within Attack on Titan ironically
probably the greatest challenge in the

453
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.419
field of literary analysis is how to
gauge whether there even is intended

454
00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:37.140
subtext in a literary work and this
isn't necessarily limited to genre

455
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.460
either Jane Austen wrote what is
ostensibly Chiclet in terms of plot

456
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:46.200
beats and characters however it is
fairly clear in her work that she was

457
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.700
very consciously writing commentary and
criticism of the English Gentry

458
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.860
sometimes there is social commentary
that is overlooked because of genre take

459
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.179
Edgar Allan Poe for instance who during
his lifetime was dismissed by American

460
00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:06.120
literary canon for writing Gothic horror
pulp the gothic genre was seen as being

461
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.159
far too rooted in sensationalist
European sensibilities and at the time

462
00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:16.500
the American literary scene was rooted
in the idea that to be legitimate one

463
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.960
must be as serious and
boring as possible indeed Poe had an

464
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.740
avid French fan base and was a
significant source of inspiration for

465
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.120
Jules Verne relocation to Europe may
have turned him into a respected author

466
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.299
instead Poe remained in America and died
nearly destitute apologizing for being

467
00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:41.220
such a bad writer and it was not until
another generation rediscovered his work

468
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.480
and began to see a great deal of
poignant and relevant commentary within

469
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.799
it the same could be said of Stan Lee
who longed to write the Great American

470
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:53.640
novel while comic books are often
criticized by literary Scholars as

471
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.720
barely more valuable than the pulp that
they're historically printed on it was

472
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.220
not until the end of his life that Lee
realized that through his contributions

473
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.960
to Marvel Spider-Man in particular he
had created a significant contribution

474
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.520
to American Literature generally
speaking though anytime it comes to

475
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.679
populous media that is media that is
popular there is a tendency among the

476
00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:21.779
media Illuminati to dismiss it the
thought process being if many people see

477
00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:26.100
the value of this media then it must be
relying on Cheap Thrills to collect its

478
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:31.260
audience yes because Homer rhyming off
the ancestors of Rich patrons reimagined

479
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.220
as Heroes of the Trojan War is
absolutely not

480
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.080
that however it can also work the
opposite way where audiences learned

481
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.340
Scholars especially can read meaning
into something where it was not intended

482
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.559
does Homer's wine dark sea actually
function as a grand and poetic

483
00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:54.539
description of the sea in a particular
light or is it just something he had to

484
00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:59.279
throw in to flush out the extra syllable
to keep up the meter unfortunately it's

485
00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:03.419
difficult to really gauge instances of
this oftentimes authors are open about

486
00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:07.260
fans reading unintended meanings into
their books though will welcome the

487
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:12.179
additional analysis artists themselves
exist in this world and there are any

488
00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:16.919
number of unknown biases they may
manifest in their work it's unlikely for

489
00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:21.600
instance that Stephanie Meyer a Mormon
intended to write a book about a girl

490
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.779
who has sex once gets pregnant and dies
but

491
00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:30.000
here we are but in many cases I can see
authors leaning into unintended analysis

492
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.559
of their media whether it's subliminally
or not it came from them so they can

493
00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:37.980
take the credit suffice to say it's
almost unheard of that the creator of a

494
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.779
celebrated and acclaimed work of
academic art will come forward and say

495
00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:46.679
you're full of [ __ ] almost unheard of
for those of you who have endured an

496
00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:50.580
English Lit 101 class or did any kind of
digging into modernist poetry you've

497
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:56.399
probably heard of earn Mali with classic
lines such as I am still the Black Swan

498
00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:01.860
of trespass on alien Waters that
rabbit's foot I carried in my left

499
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:07.320
pocket has worn a hemorrhage in the
lining the pond lilies could not stifle

500
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.200
the green Descent of frogs sounds deep
right for a very brief time earn mali's

501
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.820
poems were the toast of Australian
modernism however there was a problem

502
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.859
earn Mali didn't exist the radical
shifting landscape of art and culture

503
00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:27.060
after the first world war gave rise to
different artistic movements and while

504
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.639
these new formats were embraced quite
widely not everyone was on board enter

505
00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:36.599
Australian writers James McCauley and
Harold Stewart who set out to prove that

506
00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:40.260
all this new poetry was Much Ado About
Nothing they edited a couple of existing

507
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.520
poems and wrote a couple of new ones to
be what they consider to be bad writing

508
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.080
and developed a tragic backstory for the
late Ern Mali and mailed off the poems

509
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.919
but even after they were revealed to be
a hoax earn Mali remained a celebrity

510
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:56.099
poet
even though people knew he was fake

511
00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:00.000
poets especially in America and England
believe that Stuart and McCauley had

512
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.660
outsmarted themselves and that in the
process of trying to create nonsense

513
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.420
they somehow managed to reach down and
tap into true genius genius that they

514
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.500
never could reach in their own poetry in
other words

515
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.700
imagine your head is so far up your ass
that you would literally rather claim

516
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.859
that your pranker is too stupid to write
bad poetry then admit that you suck at

517
00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:27.780
analyzing it but am I saying that attack
on Titan is a modern day urn Mali no

518
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.640
because from what we can gather about it
it's not trying to troll conventions in

519
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.900
manga or anime it's very earnestly
trying to talk about trauma grief group

520
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:42.119
think war and terrorism the series will
very deliberately orate what a viewer

521
00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:46.440
could simply observe the series very
much wants you to know that it's talking

522
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.980
about specific things to the point of
coming out and just telling you this

523
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.119
happens so often I think that if the
series was trying to make a statement

524
00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:57.300
about fascism and Military culture it
would have the characters actively

525
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.079
engage in that discussion analyzing
literature is about looking for patterns

526
00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:05.400
and this is clearly the pattern that
attack on Titan uses but when it comes

527
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.540
to everything else that isn't directly
stated see the relevance of the urn Mali

528
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.200
hoax doesn't just demonstrate that it is
possible to convince an audience to read

529
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.579
meaning into nonsense The hoax shows us
that if an audience already believes

530
00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:21.000
there is meaning in a piece of media
there is little to nothing that can be

531
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.500
done to convince them that the meaning
they read into it isn't there this

532
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.460
fascist messaging in Attack on Titan
almost exclusively is presented in

533
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.599
visual cues but isayama was horribly
critical of his own artistic abilities

534
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:36.720
and may have simply borrowed the
established fascist looks instead of

535
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.079
creating his own so other than that
what's specifically about Attack on

536
00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:43.020
Titan implores the audience to feel that
there's anything that needs to be read

537
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.460
into it in the first place why read into
this media in a way that you would not

538
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.599
look at what we do in the shadows as a
complex commentary about generational

539
00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:56.579
gaslighting entitlement and exploitation
why do we look at one and say no that's

540
00:36:56.579 --> 00:37:01.560
just pansexual vampires and then go to
such lengths to justify a fascist or

541
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.400
non-fascist reading of the other I spoke
about this before but tragedy is almost

542
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.079
universally held up as Superior forms of
dramatic expression next to Comedy this

543
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:13.500
is almost entirely thanks to writings by
Aristotle who felt the drama was super

544
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.859
carrier because it had the emotional
ammunition capable of imparting

545
00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:21.420
political and social messages onto the
audience some may call that propaganda

546
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.720
but they risk having a black bag pulled
over their head by the hit squad of

547
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.619
academics and taken away into an
unmarked van so we're not going to say

548
00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:32.099
that because I have more to do my simple
rationale for why people may

549
00:37:32.099 --> 00:37:36.599
specifically Scholars and intellectuals
hold drama to be so significant is

550
00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:41.160
because
smart people tend to be sad it's a dull

551
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.760
cruel world when you can rationalize all
the ways that Society is constructed to

552
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.660
beat you down defaulting to the
self-evident truth that life is

553
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.280
suffering we hold media that reflects
this suffering to be closer to a truth

554
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.599
about The Human Experience a simpler
assessment would be the tragic media is

555
00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:02.280
emotionally exhausting to see your
Heroes best laid plans fail and to see

556
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.000
beloved characters meet their end and to
see possibly hours of emotional

557
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.740
investment end in sadness this takes its
toll perhaps we feel the need to read

558
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.359
meaning into these things to justify the
emotional fatigue an attack on Titan is

559
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:19.200
certainly emotionally draining entire
episode arcs are spent to establish

560
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.800
characters and within minutes not only
are they devoured alive but they are

561
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.660
denied any satisfaction or dignity Time
After Time After Time plans fail Heroes

562
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.380
fall and good people have everything
taken away from them even victories in

563
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.500
Attack on Titan feel hollow and
disappointing everything is so

564
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.880
gratuitously Bleak that at times it
reaches this kind of Lemony Snicket

565
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.720
absurdity where anything that could
possibly go wrong somehow does go wrong

566
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.220
where the plot is Twisted to scrape
every shred of dignity away from these

567
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.300
characters who fought for the greater
good tragedy and heartbreak seem to be

568
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.859
the only narrative beat it's willing to
explore for the first three seasons the

569
00:38:55.859 --> 00:38:59.400
day is only really saved because the
main characters fail upwards almost by

570
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.060
accident for all the secret hidden
abilities enemies have there's almost

571
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.599
always a trump card that the heroes
couldn't have possibly foreseen

572
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:10.859
resulting in a lot of dead secondary
characters in fact it's not until the

573
00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:13.619
fourth season where we see the main
characters essentially framed as the

574
00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:18.119
villains that they become competent and
that their plans are successful the

575
00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:21.900
series does have a pattern of characters
becoming alarmingly competent and Death

576
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.400
Proof the second they become villains
these tragedies implore us to feel that

577
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.820
there must be something to be said about
it that the audience is being pulled

578
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.320
through this bleakness in order to get
some kind of human truth out of it or is

579
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.079
tragedy using trauma in the way that
comedy use is levity that the dying and

580
00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:44.460
the suffering are merely present to give
the audience an outlet and keep them

581
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.599
engaged in the series Attack on Titan
presents the message that war is

582
00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:52.500
senseless and has no meaning this is
something the characters actually do

583
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.480
talk about however if we try to extract
meaning from this conflict when we are

584
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:03.000
told that conflict is meaningless
are we not giving meaning to those

585
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.540
fictional tragedies and if we can read
meaning into fictitious War what's

586
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.380
stopping us from Reading meaning into
actual meaningless War

587
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.560
there is a lot of stuff in Attack on
Titan and yes there is the possibility

588
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.400
that it's not saying anything at all
beyond the textual messaging of war is

589
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.520
bad but when it comes to the rampant
discourse about whether this media

590
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.300
supports fascist ideology or whether
it's subverting it

591
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.400
there's a lot of strong evidence to
point in either direction as we've

592
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.579
discussed the problem here is that
messaging is broadly applied and that

593
00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:41.579
there seems to be multiple different
interpretations of each character event

594
00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:46.320
and symbol the LDN people contain
elements of a Jewish analogy as per the

595
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.560
Discrimination they face in Marley and
the rhetoric around being the chosen

596
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.920
people of God however if Marley is seen
as a Third Reich analogy then the Nazis

597
00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.359
never used Elite Jewish combat units nor
was there any widespread success at

598
00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:03.540
fostering a sense of internalized
self-loathing amongst the Jewish people

599
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.640
they were meant to be removed from Aryan
Society not give any use and even made

600
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.680
honorary Aryans like eldians can be made
honorary Marlins by becoming one of the

601
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.940
nine Elite Titans conversely if eldians
living in Marley are meant to be Jewish

602
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.260
then what are parodiesian eldians meant
to be if parody was meant to be an

603
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.760
allegorical ghetto then how does that
symbol function when we are exposed to

604
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.200
literal ghettos at the end of season 3
is parody a ghetto

605
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.400
or is it Israel you can make that
argument but it also falls apart pretty

606
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.560
quickly because you don't have foreign
Jews trying to come kill Israelis it's

607
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.940
either an incredibly messy allegory or
it's not an allegory at all the problem

608
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.420
with any reading of Attack on Titan is
allegory itself there's no clear

609
00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.980
one-to-one comparison any comparison
that can be drawn has counter evidence

610
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.300
but just because there isn't any clear
messaging through allegory symbolism nor

611
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.220
illusion does that mean there is no
messaging at all as it happens there is

612
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.760
an alternative to allegory and that is
the much less commonly employed

613
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.500
applicability which is the driving force
behind none other than the Lord of the

614
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.720
Rings author J.R.R Tolkien developed the
Lord of the Rings as a substitution for

615
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.839
the English mythology that was erased
during the Norman occupation of Great

616
00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:23.400
Britain in 1066. during this period
through the 11th century Invaders from

617
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.240
what is modern day friends brought an
end to what was the Anglo-Saxon era of

618
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.140
England come to think of it even this
could be read as an allegory for attack

619
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.400
on Titan an island nation dominated by a
foreign Continental power that shook off

620
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.260
its oppressors to then go on and conquer
the entire world so maybe Aaron is

621
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.700
actually King George III anyway this
period of British history was marked by

622
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.480
a cultural adjustment away from the
local Germanic and Pagan roots of the

623
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.960
Island's post-roman Independence this
included not only the introduction of

624
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.560
Latin and Greek grammatical conventions
into a Germanic language system if you

625
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.680
ever wondered why English has so many
silent letters this is why but the

626
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.660
complete Erasure of English mythological
cycles pre-norm and English Heroes of

627
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.500
myth would have resembled a cross
between the Germanic likes of Siegfried

628
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.680
and the Celtic likes of kukalan Beowulf
was one of these figures but is believed

629
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.819
to be a later Edition and far from the
only one instead the Normans replace

630
00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:23.520
that with French derivative Heroes like
King Arthur Tolkien was not at all a fan

631
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.300
of this and his creation of Middle Earth
was developed over a lifetime of

632
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.420
researching scraps of surviving
documents relics and anthropological

633
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.839
discoveries the objective was to create
the closest approximation to a

634
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:38.220
mythological cycle that would not have
felt out of place among the Anglo-Saxons

635
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:43.319
famously Tolkien loathed the concept of
allegory I can imagine he felt it was a

636
00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:47.819
cheap way to beat direct moral messages
into the readers cordially dislike

637
00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:53.940
allegory and all its manifestations and
always have done so since I grew old and

638
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.800
worry enough to detect its presence
I much prefer history

639
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.380
true or famed with its varied
applicability to the thought

640
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.700
s readers
I think that many confuse applicability

641
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.900
with with allegory
but the one resides in the freedom of

642
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:19.020
the reader and the other in the purposed
domination of the author and compared to

643
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.640
his contemporaries he wasn't altogether
wrong C.S Lewis a good friend of his by

644
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.180
contrast was going to personally come to
your house and beat your parents with a

645
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.640
cricket bat if you didn't understand
that the lion is literally Jesus

646
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.440
allegory is closed off this fake thing
is this real thing in the case of

647
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.980
allegory there is an intended meaning
and there are wrong interpretations

648
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.780
furthermore if allegory is referencing
something specific then there is a point

649
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.160
at which this media loses its relevance
or when people start interpreting it the

650
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.460
wrong way look at the Book of
Revelations which is not prophesying the

651
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.060
end of the world it's prophesying the
fall of the Roman Empire which was

652
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.079
currently taking place upon its writing
suffice to say if a myth does not speak

653
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:01.800
to the ongoing culture of a Nation then
it is not a myth that will be remembered

654
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.579
because the nation cannot continue using
it for a sense of ongoing cultural

655
00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:09.599
identity and tolkien's going to roll
over in his grave when I say this but

656
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:13.740
there are allegorical parallels between
Middle Earth and the United Kingdom of

657
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.339
the early 20th century first of all it's
shaped like whales for starters there's

658
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:21.119
also strong overtones of axis themed
villains and allusions to environmental

659
00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:25.079
destroying industrialization of the
blackened land in the Southeast Tolkien

660
00:45:25.079 --> 00:45:29.339
existed within the culture of the day so
it's nearly impossible for him to not

661
00:45:29.339 --> 00:45:34.680
draw inspiration from Real World events
aware or not however these are details

662
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.520
that aren't crucial to the plot but the
symbols the plot does revolve around

663
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:44.040
were intendedly Universal and intendedly
vague the most famous among them is the

664
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.760
One Ring itself many felt that it was an
allegory for the nuclear bomb which

665
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.780
frustrated Tolkien to no end others felt
it could be wealth influence drugs

666
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.920
politics power or even the temptation of
power it's all of these things and none

667
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.160
of them what the ring represents is
something much closer to a human

668
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.960
Universal the ring represents something
that is Coveted and coveted for

669
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.220
different reasons it can't be a bomb or
a weapon because it does not give total

670
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.900
power to all those who use it it can't
be wealth because it has no utility it

671
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.460
can't be power because its users are not
invulnerable it can't be a drug because

672
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.000
drugs don't make you functionally
immortal talking about what the One Ring

673
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.780
could be is a video all on its own but
it's a symbol that speaks to the

674
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.700
cyclical corrupting elements that reside
in all people that not one person is

675
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.319
invulnerable to the Ring's call whether
they have the ability to use it or not

676
00:46:33.319 --> 00:46:38.220
applicability helps the Lord of the
Rings function as a retroactive

677
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.780
mythology because the pivotal symbols
can be reapplied to as many

678
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.740
circumstances as needed there will
always be an analogy for the One Ring

679
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.359
because there is always something that
will corrupt even the best of us even if

680
00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:55.560
the thing changes over time and from
culture to culture but is this what's

681
00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.780
going on in Attack on Titan and if it is
what is being made applicable there are

682
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.560
direct allegories to real world events
such as the ghettos and the armbands but

683
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.579
are these meant to be symbols that draw
the audience's attention to whatever the

684
00:47:08.579 --> 00:47:12.720
applicability is bear in mind that the
running of internment camps was not

685
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.440
limited to Germans and here in North
America both Canadian and American

686
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.000
internal security push Japanese people
into camps just like these are the

687
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.300
allusions to Jewish ghettos meant to
implore the audience to observe this

688
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.200
kind of ethnic persecution rather than
being a specific reference to the

689
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.640
Holocaust and instead the aldians can
possibly represent persecuted people of

690
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.900
all types rather than specifically
European Jews and especially when you

691
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.319
begin to broaden the definition of
internment camps in the imagery of

692
00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:44.280
ghettos to a broader sense of ethnic
isolation this theme could also include

693
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.960
native internment during colonial
periods and later reservations and

694
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.579
residential schools but there is a great
deal of debate in literary criticism if

695
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:57.540
characters in fiction can function as
symbols at all after all the more a

696
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.619
character needs to function as a symbol
the less agency they appear to have can

697
00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:06.119
a fictional ethnic group appropriately
function as a symbol especially provided

698
00:48:06.119 --> 00:48:09.720
that the ethnic group in question
actually does the thing that their

699
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.040
persecutors use to justify their
institutional discrimination one of them

700
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.180
does try to use the power of the Titans
to destroy the world other applicable

701
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.040
symbols such as totalitarian rule
militarization despotism sacrifice

702
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.800
propaganda humanity and consumption
again are moralized contextually these

703
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:34.380
are Concepts and themes not necessarily
symbols but applicable nevertheless hell

704
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.220
the imagery of fascism itself falls
under applicability when we think of

705
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.280
soldiers Goose stepping down a street
our brains immediately go to the German

706
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:46.140
fascists but look at the Soviets the
Chinese the North Koreans these

707
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.940
countries adopted the look and pomp of
Nazi fascism for their own brand because

708
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:55.380
it worked but those are all examples of
bad things problem with applicability

709
00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.520
and Attack on Titan is that these
applicable concepts are good and or bad

710
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.760
depending on the circumstance
applicability functions so well in The

711
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.819
Lord of the Rings because the
moralization around the applied symbol

712
00:49:05.819 --> 00:49:10.980
is universal the ring is always bad and
those who intend to use it for good

713
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:16.200
either become bad or have a very selfish
definition of what good is if you use

714
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.720
ultimate power to bring about world
peace

715
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.339
you still have a lot of ultimate power
left over just lying around those that

716
00:49:23.339 --> 00:49:27.000
want the Ring's power cannot be trusted
with it and those who do not want the

717
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.720
Ring's power aren't immune to it either
one could argue that the same line of

718
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.020
thinking can be applied to the power of
the Titans that even under the best

719
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.099
intentions those with the power of the
nine universally Resort

720
00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:41.880
to evil and that Aaron and Zeke
especially fall prey to the godly power

721
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.300
of the founding Titan but Zeke and Aaron
were flawed from the beginning and they

722
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.960
had intentions for the power of the
founder even before they had a plan to

723
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.500
use it furthermore Aaron had the power
of the founding Titan for almost the

724
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:56.579
entire duration of the series and yet
his personality made no shift from

725
00:49:56.579 --> 00:50:00.420
before and after he received it even his
ability to transform into the attack

726
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.800
Titan did not corrupt him and he used
both the attack Titan and the founding

727
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.180
Titan to help the civilians and soldiers
of parodies survived the Titan Onslaught

728
00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:13.980
applicability in Attack on Titan loses a
lot of the Finesse in nuances meant to

729
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:19.020
drive drama in the plot even once held
truths of Titan's bad is turned on its

730
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:23.339
head when the Gallant Heroes learned
that Titans are or once were humans

731
00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:27.359
which does fit into a rhetoric around
militarization practices where soldiers

732
00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:31.800
are conditioned to see the enemy as
sub-human between seasons 1 2 and the

733
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.400
first half of season 3 Titans themselves
function as an incredibly applicable

734
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.300
symbol for instance I first read the
Titans as a symbol for capitalist

735
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.440
hoarding you have a collection of large
people in differently consuming

736
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.640
everything without discrimination it's
not a stretch to see this as a criticism

737
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.839
for a handful of aged capitalists
hoarding an abundance of wealth and

738
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:55.920
making life miserable for everybody else
the small people do their best to resist

739
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.760
but most will be consumed regardless
especially since this media was

740
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.180
developed by someone who lived through
the Japanese depression of the 1990s

741
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.859
there is contextual evidence to support
this but there are other readings of

742
00:51:07.859 --> 00:51:11.339
them such as the aforementioned
dehumanized militant enemy but they

743
00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:14.819
could also refer to the process of
gentrification as they seek to push

744
00:51:14.819 --> 00:51:18.660
locals out of their communities or even
the military powers of Asia such as

745
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.700
China that bear down on the relatively
militarily weak Japan so they could mean

746
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.180
anything you want them to mean even if
we can dig through the source material

747
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.380
to find scraps of meaning that point one
way or the other is there any way to

748
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:36.240
actually discern what intended meaning
if any

749
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.079
there was

750
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:46.380
take the aforementioned quote from
Hajime asiyama being a writer I believe

751
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:51.420
it is impolite to instruct your readers
the way of how to read your story ice I

752
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.800
spend a lot of time following movie
creators press tours commentaries

753
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.520
interviews take the simplest slasher
movie and fans and interviewers will

754
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.059
inquire as to what possible
interpretations were intended filmmakers

755
00:52:03.059 --> 00:52:07.500
especially get a particular kind of
question is your Blockbuster movie about

756
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.099
X
the answer almost always runs along the

757
00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:14.040
lines of being reluctant to tell Their
audience how to watch their movie in

758
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:18.720
some instances yes there is a deliberate
social commentary scream highlights the

759
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.559
facade of suburban safety and comfort
alien speaks to the threat of venereal

760
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:26.280
infection in a society that had
abandoned condoms for the pill but a lot

761
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.599
of the time filmmakers just want to make
a fun movie it's inevitable as mentioned

762
00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:35.099
for real world events to inspire plot
beats but that doesn't mean that social

763
00:52:35.099 --> 00:52:39.359
commentary is what the movie is for
believe it or not but most entertainers

764
00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:43.559
just want to entertain that isn't to say
they aren't methodical insightful or

765
00:52:43.559 --> 00:52:47.400
elegant people it just means that
sometimes they just want to push the

766
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.359
boundaries of how many ways they can use
artificial blood provided that isayama

767
00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:55.440
offered a similar answer about art being
in the eye of the beholder maybe all the

768
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.280
tragedy and militarism and Attack on
Titan is just meant for spectacle maybe

769
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.220
all the imagery is meant to have no
deeper significance than to set the

770
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.660
stage for a world that only really seems
to function because of war and to allow

771
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.200
the audience to understand how these
characters interact with trauma the way

772
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.280
they do maybe there is no statement
about the nature of military regime

773
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.359
Doctrine and the manifestations of
Martial law maybe it's just about a

774
00:53:18.359 --> 00:53:21.420
bunch of sad people who don't know
anything but War because that's what

775
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.319
they grew up in that doesn't mean Attack
on Titan has no value with or without

776
00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:29.280
fascistic messaging there are plenty of
reasons to like it and there are plenty

777
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.619
of reasons to dislike it personal taste
is enough of a justification media needs

778
00:53:34.619 --> 00:53:38.700
to neither be grand nor demonic to
facilitate an opinion you don't need to

779
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.960
dig into the subtext to either hail it
as genius or the root of all evil being

780
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.559
entertaining is enough and I feel that
the divisive nature of this anime

781
00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:50.579
results from people having a conflict
over messaging that may or may not even

782
00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:54.300
be there to justify that their
interpretation is the correct one and

783
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.480
that if everyone else could just see
like they do it would either be the

784
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.859
Masterpiece or Pariah that it ought to
be arguing that it's the greatest piece

785
00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:04.859
of art ever created or the most
destructive or two extremes that refuse

786
00:54:04.859 --> 00:54:08.579
to see the Shades of Gray in between
Attack on Titan is good because I say so

787
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:12.960
attack on Titan is dangerous because I
say so all eldians are evil because I

788
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.160
say so all Marlins are evil because I
say so we don't live in a black and

789
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.700
white world of perfection and
inferiority where nothing is okay where

790
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:26.520
things can only be great or horrible in
this world good and evil rarely exist as

791
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.200
absolutes a world of absolutes can't
really exist the only truly absolute

792
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.280
thing is death itself which a component
of fascist ideology is this Cult of

793
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.059
death that how one dies is more
significant than how one lives perhaps

794
00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:42.540
all these characters are meant to be
cautionary tales so many of them let

795
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.200
single-minded Devotion to the greater
good lead them to their deaths and in

796
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:51.839
that process did they ever truly live
were they ever truly free death as an

797
00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:55.800
absolute shouldn't lock us into
fatalistic paths but should allow us to

798
00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.180
realize what freedoms we do have while
we are alive if death is the absolute

799
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:04.859
then all other things exist as nuances
in Shades of Gray ascribing absolute

800
00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:09.960
values of good or evil is to reject the
range of experience that life has to

801
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.800
offer the more we cling to absolutes in
anything in life

802
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:19.140
the more we can sign ourselves to a path
with no way to turn around or change

803
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.859
course
that's what Aaron did he decided that

804
00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:27.480
the greater good was worth trapping
himself on a doomed road that would only

805
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.880
end in his premature death
that's what hatred does to people hatred

806
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.040
traps you hatred removes your options
hatred takes away your freedom and it

807
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.000
tricks you into thinking those you hate
are the ones who have taken your freedom

808
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.700
away and like the characters in Attack
on Titan we exist in a world so full of

809
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:52.140
hatred that it's hard not to get mired
in it sometimes it's our job to reject

810
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.160
hate and those who propagate it not to
hate them in return but to pity them

811
00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.000
they've let their intolerance control
their lives

812
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.160
don't let it control yours
fly free and when the fascists and

813
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.599
bigots and hate mongers of the world try
to demonize you know that it's because

814
00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:13.800
they see your freedom
they see you being yourself not trapped

815
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.700
inside a cage and they hate that you can
be free

816
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.780
and they can't
you have strength they can't even

817
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:27.420
imagine and it horrifies them
because there is nothing more horrifying

818
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:31.920
to a fascist
than someone they hate

819
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.839
who refuses to die
