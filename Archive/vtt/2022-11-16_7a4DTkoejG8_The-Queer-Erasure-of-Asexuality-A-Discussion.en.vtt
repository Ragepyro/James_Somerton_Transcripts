2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.460
channel that we're gonna try out for a
bit and if you like it let us know in

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.280
the comments my name is James I'm Nick
and Gay's Behaving Badly is basically a

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.699
podcast with cameras we will be
discussing things that the queer

5
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.960
Community doesn't like to talk about or
doesn't like to acknowledge very much uh

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040
this first episode we're going to be
talking about

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:40.020
the kind of queer Erasure of all of
asexual and asexuality and aromanticism

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.140
um

9
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.539
um that's kind of one of the um
it's in a lot of ways considered one of

10
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.219
the ugly step children of the queer
community and um when I was working in

11
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.379
queer circles I there was that kind of
you worked for a pride there was that

12
00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.440
discussion very innocently had about
like

13
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.360
like they wanted to make sure that only
queer groups got like a um uh there was

14
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.659
kind of a um a kiosk sort of station
where were different groups and

15
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.080
organizations organizations would set up
kiosks that people could visit and there

16
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
was a and they wanted to make sure that
only queer people could have these spots

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
because what would happen is people
would just kind of get a spot yeah even

18
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.979
though they had nothing really to do
with queerness

19
00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
um so like there was kind of an asexual
group and there was a discussion like

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.140
is that specifically a queer group I've
seen that a lot because there's a debate

21
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.680
among especially I've seen it among gay
men that asexual people shouldn't be

22
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.100
included so much because you know
asexual people are not persecuted

23
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.100
actively persecuted for their sexuality
I I see that sort of

24
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
angle however my just I'm not saying I
agree with that oh yeah yeah that's the

25
00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.899
information but my justification for why
we should just call this disclaimer the

26
00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.979
podcast
my my organization my sort of

27
00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.300
qualification for this and we've talked
about this and you agree is um the the

28
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.660
queer Community is a community of people
established by a means of exclusion uh

29
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.760
we weren't collected in the hegemony so
we kind of banded together yeah

30
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
um and while there might be no specific
persecution for asexual people in the

31
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
way that gay people have faced there is
a kind of very quiet persecution for

32
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.860
asexuals it seem as being for instance I
think uh asexuality in the American

33
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.379
Psychological Journal is still qualified
as a mental as a psychological disease a

34
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.860
mental health disease uh correct me if
I'm wrong

35
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.560
um but like
when you are asexual you do see a myriad

36
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.319
of ways that uh there's basically a
psychological warfare against you

37
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.519
um every piece of media is focused
around a romance or sexual attraction

38
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.420
um it's seen as a for granted thing for
almost every piece of media almost

39
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.019
everyone there's that sexual expectation
and even when there's not yeah it's

40
00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.220
viewers will assume that especially if
there's a male and female character if

41
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.280
there isn't a romance between them
viewers will assume by the end of the

42
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.540
movie or the TV show that there will be
right absolutely and and outside of

43
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.459
media in like sort of polite discussion
um

44
00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.239
there's a way that people kind of you
know when you're outside of polite

45
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.480
discussion and you're kind of being more
personal with someone there's a comfort

46
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.220
with sex that is taken for granted like
you know if you're having you know a

47
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.180
rough time your close friend might say
like just go out and tag someone

48
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.659
um yeah uh and that's kind of seen as
just like a universal so it's a lot of

49
00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.620
very subtle ways that the hegemony
reminds you that you're not really

50
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.459
welcome or that you should be different
or that you're there's something wrong

51
00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
with you
um and while there isn't really any

52
00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.599
conversion therapy directed to the
asexual people

53
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.720
um and while you think that there
wouldn't be because Society is kind of

54
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.019
geared towards this neopuritan attitude
of avoiding sex and avoiding uh sexual

55
00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.519
attraction at least in public discourse
and especially like in public areas

56
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.479
um there is that expectation that it's
something that is going to happen behind

57
00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.479
closed doors yeah again just kind of
going back to the idea of of that in

58
00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.740
Media
if there's not the romantic interest if

59
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.199
there's not the sexual interest that
there will be you know the Assumption

60
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.979
because
the you know overt sexuality is the

61
00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.660
default oh yeah yeah yeah
um and like you said that there's not

62
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.979
like conversion therapy taste people but
I think there's

63
00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.240
a huge amount of pressure social
pressure yes so there's not like but

64
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.120
organized and you want to sort of have
evidence of like what you're saying

65
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.660
about there being like an expectation of
sexuality take two queer-coded

66
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.100
characters or a queer-coded character
and straight people will automatically

67
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.139
assume that they are straight like look
at Yuri from Victor from Yuri on Ice uh

68
00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.080
there is a huge straight component of
the audience for that show that assumes

69
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.100
that Victor is straight and Hyper which
is hilarious which is hilarious because

70
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.380
he's the bottom
um

71
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.759
so like there's that expectation that
it's going to be there even if in the

72
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.840
media it's not depicted that way very
clearly

73
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.280
um but like and asexuality is beginning
to be discussed in a larger broader

74
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.780
context uh nowadays
um I feel like sorry for interrupting I

75
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.280
feel like we should pause and just kind
of explain to anyone who doesn't know

76
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.740
what asexuality is that's what we're
getting that's what we're getting

77
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.220
there's there's a perception of what it
is uh there's a perception of it versus

78
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.000
what it is yeah
um and this discussion the ways that

79
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.620
asexuality is beginning to manifest in
sort of representation in media and a

80
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.520
discussion in public even when it's done
well it's usually or when it's done

81
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.860
earnestly it's usually only ever sort of
half half-baked it's a much larger

82
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.220
Spectrum it's a large larger fish fish
pond than what people see

83
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.440
um so there's
asexuality is defined as a you know

84
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.780
aversion to sex lack of sexual drive
lack of sexual attraction

85
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.060
um
and that's kind of where the definition

86
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.139
is formally very very vaguely uh there
it's very unspecific because there is

87
00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.800
you know obviously within sexuality
there is a spectrum of sexuality but

88
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.419
there is just as big a spectrum within
asexuality right of where you kind of

89
00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.500
land but the public perception of
asexuality is Sheldon from Big Bang

90
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.160
Theory I don't even think it's Sheldon
because Sheldon does have sex I know but

91
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.900
like married and
once again like that's true actually

92
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.220
um because well I see that it is asexual
it's like a lot of people in the

93
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.240
audience might think oh Sheldon is no
longer asexual

94
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.419
um when I was kind of experimenting
around with kind of identifying as

95
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.520
asexual University I was kind of close
with this one girl who lacked a lot of

96
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.319
social skills
um and when she did get a boyfriend she

97
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.639
was like guess what I'm no longer
asexual and

98
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.539
I I think that's how a lot of people
feel that it does work it's like it's

99
00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.240
like the bisexual thing when you get
married to a man or a woman it's like no

100
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.599
longer straight you're no longer gay
yeah as soon as you you know if you're a

101
00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:37.259
man and you start dating it this is this
is oddly a a belief within uh the queer

102
00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.580
Community especially especially among
gay men is that if a man is bisexual and

103
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.419
starts dating a woman he's actually not
bisexual he was you know just looking if

104
00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.560
you get married as you're Straight For
Life yeah uh or to a woman damage to a

105
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.580
woman yeah your bisexuality just
disappears and if you get married and if

106
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.000
you get a check up with a guy or get
married to a guy it's like well it's a

107
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.319
transitional period well yeah that's
that that was a big thing for

108
00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:06.539
bisexuality it was by now gay later yeah
um and like I understand why that

109
00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:12.599
existed at the time because we came from
a very binary system not just a binary

110
00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:16.319
system but a very persecutional system
where being bisexual meant that you

111
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:21.780
could still latch onto some of that
straight privilege and make you didn't

112
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.520
have to get a boyfriend yeah and sort of
make an easier transition uh into this

113
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.400
kind of sexuality
um I've actually heard the inverse too

114
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.599
that people will kind of um they'll be
straight and then they'll snap to dating

115
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.899
a guy and be like oh I guess I'm gay now
and then they'll realize wait a second I

116
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:41.159
still like girls yeah so
um I think that's where a lot of the

117
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.959
perception that my people are sneaky
um very wrongly came from because we

118
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.600
have this idea we've talked about this
the other day that there isn't really

119
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.260
room for experimentation in society
you're not really allowed to experiment

120
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.220
or play around or sort of investigate
different things it's like when you are

121
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.180
when you begin to exhibit signs of being
gay oh you're just gay it's like there's

122
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.680
no room for fluidity yeah um but back to
the asexuals that was I was living that

123
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.560
around I was saying like asexuality is
actually a lot more fluid than people

124
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.940
think it is because Sheldon can get
married well I don't think Sheldon was

125
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.180
ever I'm using that as an emergency I'm
using that yeah that's what people think

126
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.000
of asexual as the people who just have
no uh sexual drive who have no no

127
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.360
interest in sex who have no interest in
Romance who have no interest in any kind

128
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.800
of pairing whatsoever that's also not
this well yeah that is that's the

129
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.260
Assumption yes yes that's the Assumption
whereas in reality like I said there is

130
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.600
a spectrum of asexuality that goes from
that to any number Something That We're

131
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.959
beginning to realize is that there is a
separation between asexuality and

132
00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:46.620
aromantic
um yeah which I feel a little bit

133
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.140
concerned with the thing I'm starting
I'm starting to see not that I'm

134
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.040
concerned I'm starting to see a trend
for people to describe asexuality as

135
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.279
Aero Ace I'm like that's not necessarily
the case

136
00:09:56.279 --> 00:10:03.779
um yeah that's kind of the um the lgbtq
kind of yeah we'll just call you lgbtq

137
00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:07.560
it's like actually I'm a lesbian it's
like well you're LGBT some people are

138
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.899
Arrow Ace and they have neither romantic
nor sexual attraction to anyone but some

139
00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:16.380
people can fall in love very easily with
no sexual attraction and some people can

140
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.800
be very horny with no romantic
attraction talk to any asexual person

141
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.000
they will tell you they are incredibly
kinky and horny

142
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.920
asexual people I mean there's plenty of
asexual people who have no that's true

143
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.560
within the community there is kind of a
marked

144
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.700
um acknowledgment a very quiet
acknowledgment that some of the kinkiest

145
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.779
people ever meet are identifying as
asexual because they keep their sex up

146
00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:44.700
here like just don't let it get out of
their head it's um it's all internal and

147
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.180
because it never has to exist in real
life they never have to face it I'm

148
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:54.540
pretty sure that a very strong component
of fan fiction like slash fiction erotic

149
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.320
fan fiction
um libraries are contributed to by

150
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.339
asexual people

151
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.279
um so we're gonna play a game and assume
that this video gets monetized and for

152
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:11.880
anyone watching it not on YouTube plus
YouTube premium YouTube that page Fancy

153
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.019

um we're gonna take a quick break and

154
00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:22.440
we'll be right back and for anyone who
doesn't have that

155
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.820
we're back all right so this is I get
segment two

156
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.720
um so kinky
you were talking about kinky yes I was

157
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.200
talking about kinky
um and this is kind of the appearance

158
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.140
versus reality of asexuality the reality
of asexual sexuality is that it is a

159
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:46.320
very broad area and this has troubles
translating into the dating World

160
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.899
um I can imagine yeah because for me
online on Grindr the things that I will

161
00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:56.399
say to people
um first of all hopefully we'll never

162
00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:01.079
get leaked into the world uh second of
all I

163
00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:04.680
before I meet a guy and this was a
historic thing I had to kind of give a

164
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.120
disclaimer like hey heads up I know
we've been talking about certain things

165
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.440
but I need to tell you that the more you
get to know me in person I'm not as

166
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.339
horny as I seem to be yeah and that's
just because I have a very active

167
00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:22.800
imagination and I really you're a writer
yeah I enjoy the idea of sex

168
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.240
um
uh but like there are some branches of

169
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.040
asexuality which much prefer to do sex
online or sex on the phone uh sex in a

170
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.940
hypothetical context yeah
um some prefer some do not like

171
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.320
penetration and like uh and I mean
that's becoming a whole thing within the

172
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.100
gay community now is you know there's
tops and bottoms and verse blah blah but

173
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.839
now there's sides which are people who
do enjoy sex but not penetrative sex

174
00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:52.980
yeah and I I really like that that
um I always thought that butt sex was a

175
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.320
little bit overrated and just just but a
huge portion is the idea that so many

176
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.459
gay people and you might qualify as this
don't think that it counts as sex unless

177
00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:05.760
it's unless it's penetrative I've
actually really changed my mind about

178
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.740
that even even as of six months ago I
was very in the backward thinking of

179
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.120
like sex needs to be penetrative if it's
not then it doesn't count and you know

180
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.579
I've really come around to that because
you know sex I think

181
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:30.000
to me now encompasses such a wide range
from the most intense sweaty nasty thing

182
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.480
that you know Treasure Island Media
produces to you know phone sex yeah and

183
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.860
or making out in the back of a car and
you know it all depends it's a personal

184
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.339
person between like sex a sex act I
qualify anything as a sex act as asexual

185
00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:51.360
encounter anything with the intention of
having that kind of sexual passion

186
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.480
associated with it yeah
um

187
00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:02.160
and so like there there is a lot of um
explaining what I have to do

188
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.680
um and usually I get ghosted after that
because it's like because I can see

189
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.019
where they're coming where guys are
coming from in that case because it's

190
00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:13.460
like oh you're suddenly getting cold
feet and you need an out

191
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.860
[Music]
um and that's kind of how I

192
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.360
get that kind of out feeling sometimes
yeah like people would could look at

193
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.480
that as you know that you're really just
looking that you're oh what's the term

194
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.839
screening no maybe something like that
but it's there's a specific term for it

195
00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:37.980
for you know people who are just you
know they just want to you know cyber

196
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.260
and yeah that's it they'll lead you on
for weeks and weeks and weeks I I have

197
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.699
done that
um because like sometimes I need like a

198
00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:52.980
bonk I could go like bad
well listen what that is is I'm never

199
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:58.260
dishonest about it I sort of upfront and
I say like I I'm not really interested

200
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.800
in meeting up
um but I love doing cyber I love talking

201
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.480
to people and regardless of that there
is still an ongoing expectation that oh

202
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.839
we're gonna meet up eventually he's just
saying he's not into meeting people so

203
00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:15.300
he he can bypass all of the undesirable
oops I'll bypass all the undesirable

204
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.180
gays
um and when I was kind of coming of age

205
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.139
on gay data that isn't that's the first
I've heard about that just today the

206
00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:28.519
screening process yeah whenever people
that will put on the that kind of

207
00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:32.279
asexual-esque gaze to kind of screen out
the ones they're really not doing

208
00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:36.000
because like you know when I was kind of
coming of age on Grindr it was a big

209
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.540
thing to sort of say not into meeting up
not into hooking up

210
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.560
um and I like that because like
sometimes I wasn't but then sometimes I

211
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.740
was and I would find the right
personally realized oh people are doing

212
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.880
this maliciously yeah they are doing
this to screen out people who are not

213
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.600
physically attractive they're not
they're not physically attracted to

214
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.360
um
and so when you did get that kind of

215
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.880
good chemistry regardless of whether you
wanted to meet or not the other person

216
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.519
would have that expectation because it's
like oh I passed the screening process

217
00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:07.019
yeah so when you would kind of when it
would become a became apparent that you

218
00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:11.699
weren't really as into hookup culture as
they wanted to be or thought you would

219
00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:15.600
be they kind of just abandoned you
um and when you were up front and you

220
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.180
said like I'm not really into meeting up
I just want to talk

221
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.019
um
I think they got the Vibes that I was

222
00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:24.720
just consistently going to be putting
them off yeah or that they would

223
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.620
eventually pass the test one day and you
know would get to do the physical stuff

224
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:35.519
but it took me a long time to sort of be
comfortable with like being not as

225
00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:39.779
intimately sexual with people yeah um
and I kind of for the sake of being

226
00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:44.459
polite I forced myself into a lot of
kind of hookups that I wasn't really

227
00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:48.839
that interested in or that I knew I
wasn't going to have a fun time from the

228
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:52.259
beginning uh not that there was any
consent problems it's just that I wasn't

229
00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.980
really into it and I was kind of like it
was kind of like you know laying there

230
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.399
like a fish

231
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.519
yeah it seems like from the asexual
people that I've talked to that it's

232
00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:06.419
it's like a second coming out process
that you know you kind of spend your

233
00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:09.720
teenage years figuring out if you're
getting because you think you have to be

234
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.260
hypersexual because that's the kind of
depiction especially with the gay guy

235
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.120
yeah that's kind of like we have kind of
the the culture the gay culture has

236
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.439
really up until very recently when it
was kind of the gay culture has become

237
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:27.839
two dads and a kid in the suburbs that
it was circuit parties and you know

238
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:32.820
ecstasy and stuff like that that gay
culture was the height and the the the

239
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.020
absolute peak of sexuality or that
regard even if you are so how can you be

240
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.260
gay and asexual even if you are that
kind of monogamous kind of person like

241
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:46.799
when like you know watch any gay drama
like uh Elite is it Elites or Elite uh

242
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.280
that's not just gay that's gay and
straight no I know I know but like very

243
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.419
hypersexual when you were when you did
get a permanent you know boyfriend you

244
00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.840
would kind of when the door is closed
oof that's when the heat would hit like

245
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.640
it's like okay now we need to you know
the sweat needs to start pouring off us

246
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.240
and yeah and it needs to be a porno film
yeah

247
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.320
um and if it's anything less then we're
doing it wrong yeah especially when when

248
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.679
you're gay the only when you're
specifically attracted a man attracted

249
00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:16.740
to men or you know
um

250
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:22.559
then it's very much
that is your early exposure to gayness

251
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:27.539
there's not a whole lot of you know like
kids movies with a you know child

252
00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:30.960
there's no Little Rascals for gay people
or there's a childhood romance it's like

253
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.500
you you watch the kind of raunchy gay
movies a little bit earlier because

254
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.580
you're much more Curious than yeah so
that's kind of you know you're

255
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.600
hypersexual like you and Queer as Folk
yeah like I uh Queer as Folk was really

256
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.500
my first
um not my first exposure to gay people

257
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.120
but it was certainly the most so like
you know you you young little Gaby comes

258
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.960
of age and yeah like and if they're
exposure to oh this is how I beat gray

259
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.760
as an adult yeah that this is what
gayness as is as an adult this is what

260
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.260
gayness is in high school yeah even but
the the the other side of that is this

261
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:09.380
kind of and that you have that and that
conflicts with the perception of

262
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:15.299
asexuality yeah which is the doesn't
have sex and in media uh this is very

263
00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:18.960
often the case and a lot of asexual
people are kind of upset by this

264
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.600
um asexuality is represented by robots
aliens and autistic people yeah

265
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.039
um and as it happens a lot rarely
confirmed in any of those cases

266
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:34.320
um a lot of or completely unconfirmed
and just not acknowledged like with Elsa

267
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.440
yeah
um in a lot of those cases like asexual

268
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.480
people don't really like that because we
can be incredibly vibrant colorful zany

269
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.460
people uh well yeah I don't know any
asexual people who are like and even

270
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.400
Sheldon or data I think that's uh David
was snarky though I've never seen Star

271
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.760
Trek I'm just going by YouTube clips
when I was young my mom said that I was

272
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.539
a carbon copy of data uh I always loved
the character because my mom had Star

273
00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:05.039
Trek Online a lot when I was younger and
like I think that's a discredited to

274
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:08.640
autistic people too I identify as
somewhere on the Spectrum I don't know

275
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.919
what but uh because like autistic people
can be incredibly hypersexual and that's

276
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:17.940
perfectly fine too and so like kind of
pigeonholing these identities together

277
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.679
because you know this privilege
writer of privilege this creator of

278
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:26.160
privilege has this one experiment
experience with this one person thinks

279
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.820
oh this one this must be what it likes
it's like for everyone so those are two

280
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.740
very conflicting public perceptions of
what these identities ought to be yeah

281
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.179
and when you put them together it's
what do you get like people just don't

282
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:42.539
believe you
um you have no idea how many times I've

283
00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:46.679
gotten
um like I said I'm asexual and then kind

284
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:51.120
of get the retort oh you just have them
with the right person oh I I absolutely

285
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.320
believe that
um that's I've seen that in so many

286
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.940
different conversations and podcasts and
whatnot people kind of talking about you

287
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.840
know I'll tell someone I'm asexual and
it's just oh you just haven't met the

288
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.880
right guy yet
um and and it's the same with

289
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.419
um it's the same kind of thing with
women who say like I never want to get

290
00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:15.840
married and it's you just haven't met
the right guy yet or I never want to

291
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.620
have a kid yeah I was just like all your
chain you'll change your mind change

292
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.280
your mind yeah once it happens you'll
change your mind kind of thing

293
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.160
um
and so that seems to be a that seems to

294
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.179
be a societal thing that if you're
anywhere outside of the societal Norm

295
00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:33.600
which is very restrictive like I said
even a woman who doesn't want to get

296
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.140
married is outside the societal Norm
yeah that's something Society kind of

297
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.500
says to you like just wait you'll get
that's something that I was really

298
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.059
trying to push in the um the video about
Black Swan yeah kind of the concept of

299
00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:48.840
okay you're not here to procreate what
are you here for which if we haven't

300
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.200
watched that video yet go watch it I I
was really happy with how that came

301
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.780
together I wear costumes you wanted to
do that for so long you finally got to I

302
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:03.860
read a script with no glasses and I am
blind without these glasses

303
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.320
um and and so it's really just hard to
get across the the weird little nuances

304
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.940
uh yes I want to meet people I'd like to
have these experiences but like I want

305
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.780
to have them my way I want to have them
in a way that I'm I'm going to enjoy and

306
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:24.659
it's like I'm also not opposed to
negotiation like yeah but then when you

307
00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:28.080
kind of say and this is the thing about
asexuality some people some asexuals are

308
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.799
like I do not like sex I don't want to
have it it does not feel good I hate it

309
00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.740
and other people are like I could take
it or leave it yeah and that's that's

310
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.640
what I was going to say is that when you
do kind of put it on the table that like

311
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:45.120
I don't really like sex very much but
with the right person you know I will

312
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.600
you know lower my boundaries and I'll do
it which kind of poses the question

313
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:57.000
how are you asexual enough which we will
get to after the break okay so after a

314
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
break and a camera and microphone
meltdown we're back uh so yeah posing

315
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.340
the question how asexual is enough uh
that's a really really really you had

316
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.179
glasses on it's a really good question I
did I guess it doesn't matter magically

317
00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:16.080
disappeared okay
um between the two of us I don't need

318
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.940
glasses to read the loveliness of
shooting with three cameras and an

319
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:27.360
external microphone Growing Pains oh boy
uh asexual enough and that is a question

320
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.280
for the ages in the Ace Community uh
because it is

321
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.900
large in the sense of there are a lot of
people in it and not so much large in

322
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.340
the sense that ever I think there's more
people who would identify with asexual

323
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.380
if they realize that it wasn't you know
Sheldon and data yeah that it was an

324
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.820
option the discussion of what is Ace
enough comes up from a matter of some

325
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.860
ACE people do enjoy some kind of sex yes
different circumstances

326
00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.299
um but the question arises
um you know what qualifies as asexual

327
00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:03.960
because you get the purest you say ace
or aromantic means that you have no

328
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.340
sexual desire or that you have no
romantic connections uh but some people

329
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.700
have these things but in very specific
circumstances you mentioned people who

330
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.080
like to only do it for cyber yeah
um there are people who only are into

331
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.100
cyber sex people who only like to have
sex with people they are in love with

332
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.280
people who don't like who only like to
have sex with people there you have no

333
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.200
romantic connection with uh there's some
debate about like does a side qualify

334
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.799
like you know have top bottoms and sizes
that asexual because you know they don't

335
00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:35.700
enjoy penetration yeah
um and I kind of fit into that kind of

336
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:42.440
camp like and like that's I don't think
most sides within the gay community

337
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.220
would say that they're asexual probably
not no because there are plenty of

338
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.460
reasons to not enjoy butt sex aside from
just I don't like having sexual contact

339
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.539
yeah
um so like and the thing about painful

340
00:24:54.539 --> 00:25:01.200
it's messy it takes a lot of work I work
health applications just kills your legs

341
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.580
but yeah asexual enough the question is
that I had this struggle with my own

342
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.500
kind of identity because I identified as
asexual because

343
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.260
um you know I I had
I had some sexual drive I had sexual

344
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.820
urges but like when push came to shove
like I didn't really like doing it that

345
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:25.260
much yeah
um but I loved think I love the build up

346
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.960
to that I love the lead up to that I
loved thinking about it I love putting

347
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.980
myself in situations everything until
you got to his door uh yeah and then I

348
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.980
would just feel immense shame after we
were done I didn't really get that kind

349
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:41.400
of elation afterwards now is that shame
of you know shame of having had sex or

350
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.539
is that shame of not having enjoyed it
the shame of not having enjoyed it okay

351
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:48.900
um so it's not like a Puritan thing yeah
it didn't build it didn't lead up to my

352
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.039
expectations it wasn't what no is it
that it didn't meet your ad your

353
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:57.539
expectations or did you just flat out
not enjoy the deep throat thing there

354
00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:01.140
wasn't the bells the whistles the
Rockets the fireworks I didn't get that

355
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.640
for anyone not in the know
um there's a scene in the movie Deep

356
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:12.900
Throat which is a 1972 1972. uh a
straight adult movie in which some

357
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.520
somebody has an orgasm and that's where
the you know the bells and the whistles

358
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.539
and the fireworks and everything that's
where that saying comes from

359
00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:25.740
um comes from our Lord and savior Linda
Lovelace uh

360
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.580
oh there's a lot about Linda Lovelace we
won't get into it here but uh

361
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.320
fascinating figure though
um historic figure but like I I just

362
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.559
changed the world
her and Indira Gandhi

363
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.120
yeah so like I I but then again like
there I am again like a few days later

364
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.860
being like developing these very Vivid
fantasies yeah

365
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.700
um and then once again just being let
down being let down

366
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.820
um and I found that the people that I
like being around the most are the

367
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.900
people that I liked spending time around
with clothes on maybe not with clothes

368
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.500
on but you know not doing sexual things
yeah

369
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.760
um and so like for about
seven years this has been this has been

370
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.299
dodging me seven to ten years like what
what is going on with me and so I talked

371
00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:15.600
to a friend and sort of describe that
like describe this things and you said

372
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.080
okay when you have your sexual fantasies
when you kind of you know go off on your

373
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.400
own head are they about you and I'm like
no they're about circumstances and

374
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.460
situations I make up sometimes sexual
characters and he's like okay you're a

375
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.799
good sexual you're what a ego sexual a
bit of a mouthful but when the original

376
00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:36.480
studies were done on asexuality so
you're full of yourself

377
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.020
the researcher realized that there's a
very strange pattern among some of the

378
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.520
research subjects where they have sexual
desire they desire desire but they

379
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.020
didn't really have they didn't really
find fulfillment in sex or the original

380
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:55.559
term was forgive me but Auto Crow is
autocroisexuality which was more of a

381
00:27:55.559 --> 00:28:01.200
mouthful than a ego sexual but the
people of asexuals decided that aego

382
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.679
sexual is probably a better way to say
it it means that you are the ego of your

383
00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:07.679
sexuality and other people don't really
have much effector in there it means

384
00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:11.580
that you arouse yourself but not that
you're aroused by yourself it's just

385
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.520
that your imagination does the lifting
okay

386
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.240
um and I I almost had a like meltdown
because I was like that's me how did I

387
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.720
not know about this and he's like that's
because like so few people nobody talks

388
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.159
no this exists
um but unlike a lot of other

389
00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:29.940
um like it's like women not having
orgasms nobody talks about it and so so

390
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.720
many women just feel shame that they've
never done the fact that we didn't know

391
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.880
that the clitoris was as large as it is
until like the last 10 years because we

392
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.880
didn't research the in inside
no one bothered to research what the

393
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.220
inside what the internal as someone who
had to watch a lot of straight porn as a

394
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.640
teenager uh because I didn't have
internet access and we had a

395
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:59.580
pay-per-view descrambler I don't know
how straight men can't find the clitoris

396
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.640
right it's not hidden it anyway

397
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.220
um
lesbians have been finding it for

398
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.520
Millennia uh so the sexuality fandom uh
Wikipedia describes it as being

399
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.059
distinguished by the tendency towards
having sexual fantasies at times despite

400
00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:22.320
feeling a disconnect between themselves
and the sexual targets that's object of

401
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.840
arousal my friend described it as we
desire desire uh this friend also

402
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.679
identifies as he actually went into
gender studies specifically to study

403
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:37.500
this and write a dissertation about this
I'd love to read it yeah uh he plays

404
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.399
match of the Gathering now

405
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.779
as you would do a legacy format where
all the Queer as furries and uh

406
00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:51.059
Communists are uh and aegosexual
actually means sexuality without the sex

407
00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:56.760
a ego sexuality
um so I like to participate in sex as a

408
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.220
living sort of subject I examine myself
as a fantasy person so that's that's the

409
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.919
context that I like having sex and
that's why I like don't like doing it

410
00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:09.240
that often Because the actual sensation
is of having it is less than the

411
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.020
imagined sensation of what it appears or
how it appears yeah

412
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:19.860
um it's like people who have you know in
their fantasies they have you know maybe

413
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.120
an extreme Kink that would be you know
not necessarily like violence or

414
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.899
anything but something that most people
would be like I found some of those but

415
00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:31.200
then in real life they're just kind of
like oh no I would never actually do it

416
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.860
yeah yeah and so like when I say that or
they did or they would and then it would

417
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.820
ruin the fantasy but yeah when I say
that asexual people can be some of the

418
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.240
horniest and kinkiest people you're
leveling ever Evelyn ever encounter it's

419
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:48.360
because that outside of the puritism
purism of asexuality there are a myriad

420
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.580
of different ways that the human brain
is just really weird about sex yeah not

421
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.020
weird isn't bad but weird as in like
it's it's complicated it's complicated

422
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.919
uh it's like she's complex but
um so yeah like there are these are

423
00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:08.640
things that are the subject of research
and the subject of academic Fascination

424
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.059
even if there isn't really a lot of
academic interest in these things some

425
00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:15.659
people are we're gonna see start seeing
a little bit more of this

426
00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:20.700
um but there is a bit of a distinction
between these between you know these

427
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.120
sort of more psychological elements of
asexual and the more self-identifying

428
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.659
ones which you know there are legion of
flags

429
00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:31.679
um because you know the asexual
Community has been kind of ignored like

430
00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:36.779
we said by the queer community at large
so I feel like there is a over tendency

431
00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:42.240
to self-identify and to sort of
construct a the version of asexuality

432
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.539
around a specific you know circumstances
yeah and I feel like the pure the

433
00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:52.679
gatekeeping the purest gatekeeping of
asexual aromanticism has led to that

434
00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:57.779
like you can't be asexual because you
enjoy sex and these circumstances and

435
00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:05.100
it's like but yeah I'm still you know
I'm still weird about it um and so like

436
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.820
it's I I feel like this is a situation
where self-identified having the

437
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.299
openness do I just identify
self-identifies asexual meaning like I

438
00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:18.720
don't fit the sexual Norm of either the
CIS had hegemony or the queer community

439
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.640
so I I need to belong here because I
don't belong anywhere anywhere else yeah

440
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.140
um and I really hope we can start moving
towards that because I hate seeing so

441
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.460
much fragmentation within within sub
communities yeah

442
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.960
because it it does cut I feel like there
is an extent like yeah it's important to

443
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.980
recognize the distinction between gays
and lesbians and bisexual people and how

444
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.520
uh and especially trans people in the
LGBT and how the assistant hegemony

445
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.760
uniquely persecutes against each of
these camps of people and yeah different

446
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.500
cocktails of privilege that they might
that gay men will in particular kind of

447
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.700
push back against all the other letters
in the alphabet well that's that's honey

448
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.580
oh that's a whole that's a whole other
discussion I'm talking about how the

449
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.899
persecution of a gay man is different
than a gay woman yeah

450
00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:11.100
um is different from bisexual man is
different from a bisexual and especially

451
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.240
it gets different when you factor in
people of color and how these respective

452
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.019
communities approach queerness very
different uh and so like I there is it

453
00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:22.860
is important to recognize the difference
in discrimination and the difference in

454
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.700
the Dynamics of social dynamics as they
fit into the society at large but and so

455
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.440
I feel like if if your version of this
thing doesn't really change the dynamic

456
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.039
of persecution against issue or the
manifestation of your relationship with

457
00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:37.500
the culture and I don't I don't feel
like it's

458
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.399
like it's fine if you want to kind of
have this sort of label on yourself but

459
00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:43.919
make sure you're putting the label there
yourself don't let anyone else label you

460
00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:48.179
about you but you yeah
um that's fine but I feel like a formal

461
00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:51.840
definition or distinction of this kind
of does take away from a lot of the

462
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.140
discussion especially when you get CIS
people straight people so straight

463
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.320
people who are like there are so many
more letters than there used to be I

464
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.120
just can't keep up and it's like don't
try yeah that's you know we made a whole

465
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.360
video talking about why we need to just
get rid of the letters and just go first

466
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.800
describing it to like um and a big part
of that I think is you know if there was

467
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:17.520
Queer as an umbrella term then all the
different flavors of asexuality would be

468
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.760
you know you would have you couldn't
devalue different kinds of asexual

469
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:29.220
because you know they're all on the same
Turf as all the other ones that an

470
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:34.080
asexual who is incredibly horny but only
for a specific type of person you know

471
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.820
is on the same level as an asexual who
has abs absolutely no interest in sex

472
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.480
whatsoever and they just want to you
know play D D

473
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.040
um and that's one of the reasons I do
think funny fact um people who play D

474
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.460
get laid more than you would believe
but yeah that's that's like I said

475
00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:57.000
that's why I think there should be an
overarching term that isn't so uh and I

476
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.380
don't blame the the fragmentation on
individuals needing to be special Stars

477
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.760
I blame it on purist gatekeeping oh
absolutely and that's kind of I know I

478
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.500
want to be clear about that like I you
know like the the gold star gay yeah

479
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.780
thing the Platinum star gay yeah I had a
C-section yeah like I was born via

480
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:21.780
C-section were you yeah oh I wasn't 48
hours at Labor beforehand but

481
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.619
um
before we continue we will do one last

482
00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:31.560
break and uh then we'll come back with
our final thoughts and welcome back to

483
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.579
the show gaze Behaving Badly that's what
we're called we haven't really behaving

484
00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:40.980
that badly today so yeah in you know
closing thoughts section would be kind

485
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.700
of
uh you were saying that uh we just

486
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:50.520
watched hell of a boss uh yeah and you
watched the husband hotel which was the

487
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.000
thing that's spun off of yeah and you
said that there is an asexual character

488
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.579
and you quite enjoyed that well they're
identified in the wiki as asexual like

489
00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:02.700
they don't say it in the show but
because you know they only have one

490
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.820
episode he only Pops in at the end of
the episode

491
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:13.619
um but the Creator and the in the wiki
they are I think identified as asexual

492
00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:17.460
um and I thought that was cool because
basically has been between has been

493
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.020
hotel and hell of a boss every letter of
the eye

494
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.740
every one of them
um because apparently even in Hell of

495
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:31.020
the boss Moxie is bisexual
I buy that which I didn't I I didn't

496
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.280
Roxy's the cute little boy right well
he's not a little boy but like he's a no

497
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.700
Boi like he's yeah he's adorable he's a
boy

498
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.380
um I mean like I buy that like not that
pegging or getting pegged makes you buy

499
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.220
makes you queer but like
but

500
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.079
um I I've seen him kind of be flustered
around the boys yeah yeah but yeah

501
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:56.160
there's you know a character who is at
least in the wiki identified as asexual

502
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:03.180
and you wouldn't guess it from his
character because you know he's not the

503
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:09.119
Sheldon or the data or the and he
I like that in hell of a boss uh

504
00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:13.560
monogamous is the
um

505
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.260
is the taboo that's the one that nobody
likes to talk about or like is

506
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.740
hell yeah yeah I I just really really
enjoyed that sort of flipping the script

507
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:28.260
yeah but I would like to see more of
that going forward even if it's if it's

508
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.400
characters that are uh identified as
asexual that would be great but for whom

509
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.720
the well like ASAP like asexual does
like does there need to be a declaration

510
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.940
made or sort of a specification made or
is just the plot acknowledging that

511
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.320
there is no romantic future for this
character that sounds so Bleak but there

512
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.700
is no intended romantic future for this
character yeah um and this character is

513
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.240
comfortable with that yeah is just
writing that into the character and into

514
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:59.040
the plot enough or a
is that good enough or does there need

515
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.400
to be a soapbox moment
yeah and I mean that's that's kind of a

516
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.359
question with gay stuff too is it okay
to just have a gay character who is a

517
00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:11.220
great character or do they have to have
a boyfriend to confirm the gayness yeah

518
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.960
um you know it's like in wakanda forever
there is a lesbian character and she's

519
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.800
pretty badass throughout the movie she
only has you know that one moment where

520
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:25.619
it's confirmed that she is queer and a
lot of people say you know that's really

521
00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:30.000
good representation and a lot of people
say that doesn't count because it can be

522
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.440
sucked out for for screening which it is
being it's the movie's not getting a

523
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.099
Chinese a Chinese release
um but it is being

524
00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:42.480
um uh it has been requested to be
removed by Kuwait

525
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.520
um so it's short enough to be removed
and so does it count if it is so

526
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.760
insubstantial that it is removable yeah
that's a whole other discussion that'll

527
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.599
be a video yeah not necessarily about
wakanda forever but about that whole

528
00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:59.760
thing when it comes to gay people I like
I I don't like having the soapbox moment

529
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.060
because I don't think straight when you
have gay representation when you want to

530
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.200
have gay representation straight people
don't need gay representation gay people

531
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.320
need gay queer people need queer
representation yeah

532
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.380
um so having that soapbox moment where
you explain to queer P to straight

533
00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:18.119
people that it's okay to be gay
that's not useful to us because we

534
00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:22.079
already have these messages we already
have and the ways that gay people or

535
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:25.740
queer people would interpret
self-acceptance is different than the

536
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.980
way that straight people wouldn't
interpret accepting queer people yeah so

537
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.400
there's need to be two very different
manifestations of how this media handles

538
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.200
that thing and you know with a gay
character I think you know I I am

539
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.599
growing more okay with the incidental
well I like the incidentally queer

540
00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.599
characters
um the ones that there is no soapbox

541
00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:50.220
moment yeah I like it if maybe they
actively show their attraction to

542
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.180
someone of the same sex but for an
asexual character I think it would be

543
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.680
enough like lose from the owl house I
think that is like she's not asexual

544
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.640
bisexual she's bisexual but like that
kind kind of attitude where it's

545
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.180
apparent but it's never made a deal out
of no one really questions and she

546
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.780
doesn't need to get in a soapbox because
everyone's like oh okay yeah but with an

547
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.040
asexual character I think it would be
enough to have another character kind of

548
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.400
say you know like the stereotypical you
just need to get laid Yeah like oh

549
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.339
you're stressed out you just need to get
laid and then be like I don't like doing

550
00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:22.800
that but yeah like and then that's
enough and I've always kind of felt like

551
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.260
there are ways instead of having that
soapbox moment driving that

552
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.920
identification you can do that but also
there are ways that uh queer people

553
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.820
asexual people bisexual people they
interact with the world differently than

554
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.540
other people of different sort of camps
yeah so as long as you write that in and

555
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.900
you do it earnestly and I think your
opinion as an asexual person your

556
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.839
opinion on this matters more than mine
but like I also don't want to speak for

557
00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:46.560
the entire Ace Community I think that
you do need a balance of soapbox moments

558
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.140
as well as you need to have that
incidental incidental representation

559
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.619
yeah like I feel like the soapbox
moments should be like on Disney plus we

560
00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:57.180
all be made on for TV shows for movies
for kids and teenagers but I think you

561
00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:05.099
also need that mix of uh fastos from um
eternals where like his motivation was

562
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:09.240
Inseparable from his you know really
from his gay gay marriage oh yeah

563
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.000
absolutely yeah
um I I do think that kind of

564
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.380
representation is important I think we
need a mix and that's the thing that you

565
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.540
know CIS straight Holly males old white
yeah they think they get is that they

566
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.619
think okay this is how we do
representation instead of as a formula

567
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:29.579
because it's like as long as we do this
and they'll be happy and it's like think

568
00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:32.280
but you got to do other things too and
it's like that's too much yeah like I

569
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.760
think which which and that's like a sort
of thing which representation do we use

570
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.820
for this media and it's like you need to
let a creative person do that in which

571
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.240
they point they their heads start
spinning around and they start throwing

572
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.060
up
um the soup and God forbid let a

573
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.140
creative person do something so I think
that's kind of the message of this is

574
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.680
Maybe
Maybe

575
00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:00.359
to any Executives listening
let the creative people tell the stories

576
00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:03.780
because you know there are plenty of
straight people who've told great gay

577
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.020
stories God knows there's plenty of gay
people who've told great straight

578
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.760
stories right and there are plenty of
people out there who are asexual who

579
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.220
have stories to tell that might be
hilarious comedies or might be very oh

580
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.640
asexuality is absolutely hilarious I can
everything that I've kind of said in

581
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.760
here that's kind of like oh poor Nick no
it can be funny with a different well

582
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.119
yeah I look at the same time like like
it can be really funny stories they can

583
00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:30.660
be comedies they could be dramas and
they have stories to tell so maybe let

584
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.700
them tell them instead of having someone
who is definitely not asexual say this

585
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.020
is what I think one of them is
okay

586
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.099
so that's the end of the first episode
of gays Behaving Badly yeah tell us what

587
00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:48.420
you think we know you will yeah

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.060
um if you liked our show tell everyone
that

590
00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:58.560
if you think this sucks keep your pig
it's from it's the um the uh I've heard

591
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.420
that before it's from The Producers it's
their Encore all right right yeah

592
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.720
um so yeah let us know in the comments
if you like this style if so we'll do

593
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.640
one a month
um and if there's any topics that we try

594
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.760
to avoid as a community but you think
are kind of important to talk about
