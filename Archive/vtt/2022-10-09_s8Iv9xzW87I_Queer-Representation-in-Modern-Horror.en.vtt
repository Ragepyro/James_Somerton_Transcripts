00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.179
at the 1984 Democratic National
Convention Bobby Campbell a prominent

2
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.160
AIDS activist argued for a presidential
candidate who would actually address the

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
AIDS crisis unlike the Reagan
Administration whose mandate regarding

4
00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.420
the growing pandemic was to look pretty
and do as little as possible in

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.800
Campbell's speech he discussed the need
for diverse representation of queer

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
people in Media I have a message for the
nation

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.920
very often lesbians and gay men are
portrayed as isolated alienated and

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.940
alone or else in a pathetic search for
desperate sexuality

9
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
I don't think that that's true and I
think that it's important for people to

10
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
understand that lesbians and gay men do
not exist outside of a context we exist

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.280
in the context of the people we love and
those that love us Campbell's demand for

12
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.619
more stories that truly represent the
queer experience as human experience has

13
00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.540
oddly
taken hold most strongly within the

14
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
horror genre in one way or another
despite their focus on pain and

15
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
suffering horror films explore a wide
range of human fears often these fears

16
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.060
are projections of mass societal
anxieties that touch upon politics

17
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.259
psychology sociology and relationships
between vastly different life

18
00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
experiences the horror genre
consistently mirrors the concerns and

19
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.840
fears of society as a whole
Invasion of the Body Snatchers depicts

20
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
the apprehension of the 1950s regarding
an alien or foreign Invasion the hunger

21
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.240
and Fright Night portray the
infectiousness of queer culture in the

22
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.159
1980s and the final moments of Night of
the Living Dead shed light on the racism

23
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.020
of the 1960s and Cloverfield depicted
the apprehension of a societal

24
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
Apocalypse in the wake of September the
11th horror utilizes the Fantastic to

25
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.259
develop the internal fears of these and
countless other periods thereby

26
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.400
extrapolating their shared realities
I've tried to look at how horror affects

27
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.300
us over the last couple of years first
with a look at the history of queer

28
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.040
representation and Horror in my video
monsters in the closet then as society's

29
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.520
Fear of Everything queer and different
in deep cuts

30
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.840
and then last year I looked at how we
queer people will let monsters into our

31
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.900
lives because we think we deserve
nothing better

32
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.379
this has become a sort of tradition for
me every October

33
00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.640
a tradition I have all too much fun
digging my teeth into

34
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.480
and this year is no different
but instead of looking at how horror is

35
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.660
queer-coded
let's actually take a look at horror

36
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.519
from a truly queer perspective
queer creators queer characters queer

37
00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.540
monsters and something that Hollywood so
very rarely deigns to give us

thank you

44
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.940
I spoke about The Silence of the Lambs
all the way back in monsters in the

45
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.280
closet and touched again on it briefly
and fear-coded so I feel it is best to

46
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.939
start with something that happened right
after the release of the film The

47
00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.979
revelation of a truly horrific queer
monster that was all too real

48
00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.180
Jeffrey Dahmer
Dahmer was a gay serial killer with a

49
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.680
penchant for pedophilia he frequently
abducted young men and boys from gay

50
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.780
bars raped and murdered them and then
used their bodies in gruesome medical

51
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.460
experiments he'd admit that he was
trying to make sex zombies out of the

52
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.860
bodies he dismembered and experimented
on so that they'd fulfill his sexual

53
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.300
needs and never leave his side Dahmer
said he drugged and raped the men then

54
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.960
drilled holes into their brains and
injected chemicals to turn them into

55
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.380
mute zombie sex slaves after his victims
passed on he would do anything from

56
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.360
keeping their body parts as souvenirs to
engaging in necrophilia

57
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.979
to even eating them unfortunately the
police largely rejected the evidence of

58
00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.680
gay survivors and their families after
Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys most of

59
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.040
whom were young men of color in May of
1991 police found one victim a 14 year

60
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.800
old walking the streets naked and still
confused from Dahmer's drugging

61
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.639
he had fled from Dahmer's apartment
Dahmer told the authorities that the

62
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.320
young man was his boyfriend and asked
that he'd be returned to his care

63
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.460
the cops complied
and Dahmer killed the boy shortly

64
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.560
thereafter in 1991 when Jeffrey Dahmer
was in the news and Buffalo Bill was in

65
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.180
theaters the public received a barrage
of messaging claiming that homosexual

66
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.740
serial killers were widespread in the
United States and often connected to

67
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.820
pedophilia the notoriety of serial
killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and John

68
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.759
Wayne Gacy before him along with the
media's unrelenting focus on them

69
00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.560
contributed to the stereotype that all
gay men were perverts while heterosexual

70
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.840
serial killers Like Richard Ramirez and
Ted Bundy were rarely categorized as

71
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.300
such and their sexual orientation was
rarely the focus of public attention

72
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.560
unless it was women throwing themselves
at Ted Bundy one source of violence

73
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.520
against LGBT individuals is The
Stereotype that they're more likely to

74
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.199
engage in violent Behavior due to their
malicious sexuality

75
00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.880
in addition the Casual homophobia of
1980s films and toxic masculinity

76
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.080
portrayed therein contributed to the
violence against queer people in the

77
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.600
1990s and afterwards Nightbreed directed
by Clive Barker explores the formation

78
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.580
of a queer family as a means of safety
from the violence of the outside world

79
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.740
Clive Barker a pioneering openly gay
author and filmmaker encodes almost all

80
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.479
of his works with queer themes after
being duped by his psychiatrist into

81
00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.919
thinking that he's a serial killer our
protagonist seeks Solace among the

82
00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:07.080
Nightbreed a group of outcast creatures
who dwell in a deserted Cemetery for

83
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.660
protection from the rest of society
can anyone watch Nightbreed and not

84
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.160
automatically associate the titular
characters with queer people asks Trace

85
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.660
Thurman co-host of the horror queers
podcast they've been Outcast by society

86
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.220
and are deemed as dangerous by the
normal people the climax of the film

87
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.900
culminates in an assault on the
nightbreed's home base of Midian as the

88
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.620
normies would rather kill all of them as
opposed to understand them

89
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.599
sound familiar queer undertones are a
vital part of Nightbreed rather than

90
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:45.180
risk the anger of respectable citizens
the film's monsters retreated into their

91
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.380
own Enclave
the normies want to hurt and kill

92
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.720
everyone who is different from them
the monsters who were othered because of

93
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.460
their looks came together to establish
Midian and their own

94
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.660
other queer family
the creatures of night breeds Midian

95
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.000
were very much present in the 1990s
American reality we monsters knew we had

96
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.860
to stick together to avoid being victims
of regular people's aggression and to

97
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.180
look out for each other in case one of
them was attacked not surprisingly

98
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.960
anti-queer and transphobic violence
continued to be a problem throughout the

99
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.759
1990s with two of the most high profile
killings of the time that of Brandon

100
00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.720
Tina in 1993 and that of Matthew Shepard
in 1998

101
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.399
acting as sort of horrific bookends that
saw the American government first

102
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:39.539
Embrace queer people well at least gay
people and then throw us under the bus

103
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.039
for political expediency but in the
fictions of the big screen queer writers

104
00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:48.000
and directors have had much more of a
say in what happens than in real life

105
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.740
since the 1930s such creators have been
at the Forefront of the horror genre but

106
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.000
that doesn't mean they always have the
LGBT community's best interests at heart

107
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.100
Kevin Williamson who penned the faculty
and scream came out as gay to his family

108
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.380
and friends in 1992. unfortunately the
character of stokely's betrayal and the

109
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.940
faculty perpetuates the Trope of the
butch lesbian who after meeting the

110
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.180
right boy
suddenly becomes comfortable with her

111
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.140
own femininity
but is that Williamson's fault queer

112
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.519
filmmakers especially queer
screenwriters will have their work

113
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:27.360
relentlessly scrutinized by Executives
for markers of queer sexuality as

114
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.339
queerness has been suppressed or
portrayed as evil for decades a lot of

115
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:36.300
pressure gets put on gay artists to fix
the queer image

116
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.380
when it really should be shared more
evenly with their straight and cisgender

117
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.640
contemporaries however queer authors and
filmmakers of the genre have an

118
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.640
opportunity to give audiences a peek
into and through the queer lens and to

119
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.260
create characters that are not Odes to
the repeated stereotypes that have

120
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.220
plagued gay characters for most of
Cinema history

121
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.720
but we queers had some reason to hope
that perhaps

122
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.920
we wouldn't be straight washed out of
horror Cinema anymore with the character

123
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.899
of David from the Bride of Chucky an out
gay character who isn't tragic or the

124
00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:16.560
butt of a joke
he's killed on screen of course but not

125
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.820
by our Plucky team of Serial killing
dolls Chucky and Tiffany instead he

126
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.240
accidentally steps in front of a semi
and gets liquefied on the highway he's

127
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.959
not killed because he's gay but because
he wasn't watching where he was going

128
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:33.480
and so the 1990s ended on a hopeful note
for queer visibility in the horror genre

129
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.160
sadly the queer Persona is created for
the horror spoofs that swamped the box

130
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.720
office in the 2000s would derail this
ambition due to the widespread coverage

131
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.820
of falling and broken bodies from the
World Trade Center attacks in 2001 as

132
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.260
well as Internet footage depicting
suspected terrorists being subjected to

133
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.380
gruesome torture techniques like
waterboarding and bodily stress

134
00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.959
positions by American CIA agents
Americans had become desensitized to

135
00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:05.820
your typical slasher films and so a
sub-genre focusing on body horror

136
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.839
emerged alongside the rise of the horror
comedy

137
00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:13.260
there would be just as much anger at the
start of the new decade due to

138
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.100
inaccurate portrayals of the queer
Community as there had been

139
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.600
at the end of the last one

140
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.380
unfortunately outdated homophobic
stereotypes jokes and slurs persisted in

141
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.399
the media depictions of queer people
especially in the horror genre Kelly

142
00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:40.620
Rowland a real-life member of Destiny's
Child plays the character of Kia in the

143
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.240
slasher Blockbuster Freddy vs Jason
which had the guts to include a

144
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.740
homophobic slur intended at horror
Legend Freddy Krueger the question is

145
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.940
posed
what kind of runs around in a Christmas

146
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.480
sweater
I don't know what else could serve as a

147
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.339
better time capsule for the early 2000s
than this line Chris egerton editor of

148
00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:06.180
billboard magazine said Kia uses it as a
term of

149
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.459
denigration and emasculation it is
lobbed in an effort to diminish his

150
00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:15.899
power just as it has been against LGBT
individuals throughout history you're

151
00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:20.279
not even scary she follows up Freddy
goes on to semi-refute this by having

152
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:24.240
Jason brutally murder her
if only he could have murdered that line

153
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.160
too Freddy versus Jason wasn't the only
example of casual homophobia finding its

154
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.300
way into the horror genre though
Millennium horror tends to Echo the

155
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.519
Casual homophobia of the 1980s
films like American Psycho which is set

156
00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.380
in the 1980s Wall Street World revealed
the homophobia rooted in fear of the

157
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.100
other that was at the root of the
Decades usage of queer people as punch

158
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.839

documentary how to survive a plague

his breakout 2006 film hostile written
and directed by Roth hostile follows

themselves at the hands of psychotic

violence profanity and bro talk with
several of the characters using gay

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.540
slurs as forms of insult and comedy in
addition while riding the train Josh

hostile in fengoria magazine in 2006 the

187
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.560
lesson learned
no matter how nice they seem never be

188
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.079
nice to a homosexual because in the end
they'll get you the characters

189
00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:21.000
continuously refer to each other as
Edgar you're gay and everyone laughs and

190
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.480
everything is Jolly
but not for a lot of queer rights

191
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.740
supporters I understand that this is
just a horror film and that it probably

192
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.060
won't impact much of society but as long
as a movie like this continues to Target

193
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.760
an audience of teens to late 20s
heterosexual males issues of anti-gay

194
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.040
Prejudice will never be satisfied Roth
initially met this criticism with a

195
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.260
reaction akin to boys will be boys
the following year a musician turned

Halloween
as with Roth's hostile homophobia rears

198
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.680
its ugly head with slurs littered
throughout the film

199
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.420
however while Roth's use of homophobia
is more gratuitous chalked up to Young

200
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.260
people's vernacular
zombies frequent uses of homophobic

201
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.300
slurs particularly the epsler are said
by characters the audience is not

202
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.320
supposed to empathize with
but rather revile

203
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.240
unlike Roth's protagonists hostile part
2 is an example of how a filmmaker can

204
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.139
actually take criticism and grow this
film is still Tethered to the torture

205
00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:33.180
porn trend of post-9 11 horror so no
character is safe from mutilation but

206
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.779
the film does feature a queer lead
character who is level-headed and not

207
00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:42.779
fetishized she dies of course because
well hostile but you know baby steps and

208
00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:47.519
those baby steps were needed film
historian Vito Russo said gave his

209
00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:52.259
ability has never really been an issue
in the movies it's how they have been

210
00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:56.519
visible that has remained offensive for
almost a century

211
00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:02.100
so no more films about homosexuality
instead more films that explore people

212
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.439
who happen to be gay in America and how
their lives intersect with the dominant

213
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:12.179
culture he said this in the 80s as the
New Millennium lumbered on fresh gay

214
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:17.040
narratives were much appreciated if rare
it was time for a new narrative one that

215
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.160
didn't dwell on the difficulties of
being queer in America but instead

216
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.100
focused on everyday Americans who
just happened to be queer in 2002's May

a doll May speaks with when nobody's
around

225
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.580
the audience sympathizes with this odd
girl who just wants some attention

226
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.539
despite the fact that she turns into a
horrible killer later in the film

227
00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:11.640
spurred on by Adam dumping her and
calling her strange May runs away from

228
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.740

the arms of Paulie who says to kiss you

May is skeptical at first but she soon

discovers that she actually likes Polly
Polly noticing May's reticence says do

you feel weird diamonds I am weird

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.080
despite the fact that Paulie and her
other lover Ambrosia are eventually

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.980
killed by May in her quest to construct
a doll out of human parts in the style

neither paulies nor May's sexualities

film doomed to the same fate as
countless other female protagonists in

237
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.140

nothing special about being queer in a

the show have argued about whether or
not the presence of Edwards and

246
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.700
Meriwether is objectionable and whether
or not it's a rare opportunity for

247
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.580
mainstream audiences to experience gay
black male sexuality on film in 1990

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.860
okay black filmmaker Marlon Riggs said I
feel very ambivalent

249
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.260
it plays into the stereotypes the
dominant culture has of us

250
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.799
but that's not my concern
not that they're Queens they're Camp

251
00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:08.580
Queens
but rather it's an image of Queens who

252
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.260
function in a way that justifies all the
very traditional beliefs about black gay

253
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.480
sexuality it plays into an ocean of
black asexuality held by the black gay

254
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.640
community a notion that black gay men
are sissies ineffectual ineffective

255
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.660

inferiority rather than empowerment

both the first and second film of the

260

perpetuation of homophobic stereotypes

261
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.620
and the gay antics of the characters of
In Living Color Rey's homosexuality is

262
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.700
strongly implied by the fact that he is
constantly making lewd advances toward

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.280
the United States of America in the
2010s was teeming with newly discovered

portended difficult days ahead for the
queer community in the U.S for queer

313
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.140
Americans Trump's selection of openly
anti-gay Mike Pence as vice president

314
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.400
was a clear signal that his government
would be far less welcoming than the

315
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.840
previous one despite Trump's own
half-hearted attempts to appeal to queer

316
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.059
voters all of this led to a terrorist
attack on the queer community

317
00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:24.960
which would become the bloodiest mass
shooting in U.S history up to that time

318
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.240
a shooter opened fire at the Pulse
Nightclub in Orlando Florida on June 12

319
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:36.299
2016. there were 50 fatalities the vast
majority of them LGBT Latino men

320
00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:40.620
after the events of September 11 2001
this was the worst terrorist assault in

321
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.940
the United States and the deadliest mass
shooting in American history since the

322
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.299
Pulse Nightclub was so well known for
its queer clientele it was immediately

323
00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:52.980
recognized as the target of a homophobic
attack when news of the shooting spread

324
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:59.100
another blow was dealt to the queer
community on July 26 2017 when President

325
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.779
Trump declared his intention to Bar
transgender people from serving in the

326
00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:07.380
U.S military
in a series of tweets

327
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.100
and yet despite the devastating and
frustrating defeats queer Americans

328
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.659
endured throughout the Trump
Administration film would prove more

329
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:19.260
accessible than ever to the experiences
of queer people

330
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.059
even more so than in other genres horror
films regularly feature dozens of queer

331
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:29.279
characters often depicted with Grace and
respect for the queer experience horror

332
00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:33.840
at its best has always been political
from Invasion of the Body Snatchers

333
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.460
extrapolating the fear of the Cold War
into stories of violent alien encounters

334
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.900
tonight of the Living Dead having the
black hero of a zombie apocalypse slain

335
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.580
by white police officers
this sub-genre of fiction takes a

336
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.440
fantastic and horrific look at the state
of American politics it's possible that

337
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.419
the generally positive gay portrayals
and horror films of the 2010s

338
00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:01.740
could help to counter The increased
hostility and backlash that had been

339
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.400
directed at members of the community
after the election of Donald Trump and

340
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.559
the emergence of white supremacist
Neo-Nazi movements all across the

341
00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:13.919
country
sometimes horror movies even act as a

342
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:17.820
Force for good as part of their
marketing campaigns for new films one of

343
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.919
the bloodiest film franchises in history
saw had organized wildly successful

344
00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:27.960
blood donation campaigns since the
franchise's Inception in 2004 the blood

345
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.659
drive has been an integral part of the
saw franchise serving both to promote

346
00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:38.340
the famed torture porn blood Fest that
are the saw films and to thank donors

347
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.380
with complementary seats to the premiere
in 2017 the campaign took a more

348
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.159
political turn
drawing attention to the discriminatory

349
00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:52.260
of blood donation policies that Target
gay men the FDA instituted a lifetime

350
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.539
prohibition on any potential male donor
who had had sex with a man at the outset

351
00:27:57.539 --> 00:28:01.860
of the AIDS crisis even though blood
donation programs are mandated to check

352
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.539
all participants blood
this implies that gay blood is

353
00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:10.860
inherently unhealthy and undesirable
social media personalities with huge

354
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:16.260
queer fan bases were featured in the
blood drives campaign in 2017. as of now

355
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.580
the saw blood drives have collected over
250

356
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.799
000 pints of blood despite the fact that
few are safe from the clutches of evil

357
00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:29.039
and horror movies the genre has in
recent years

358
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:33.240
provided a welcoming environment in
which gay characters can be explored and

359
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.919
regarded seriously like in happy death
day and happy death day to you

360
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:42.419
where a recurring queer character named
Tim is given multiple opportunities to

361
00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:45.659
come out
at first glance he comes across as a

362
00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:53.580
typical sexist dude bro but is revealed
by the protagonist to be in fact gay

363
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.900
Tim's screen time is relatively short in
both movies but the director's decision

364
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.340
to incorporate and emphasize what may
seem like a side narrative to the main

365
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.960
plot will always stick with gay viewers
the film's director the openly gay

366
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.059
Christopher Landon was bullied as a
child for being gay and an outcast as a

367
00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:16.200
child Landon sought comfort in horrific
stories which sparked his interests and

368
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.580
Ambitions in the horror genre by
including Tim's narrative in his films

369
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.020
the director sends a message of
acceptance to the many other queer Youth

370
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.080
and adults
all across the world

371
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.919
Don Mancini via his iconic Child's Play
franchise is well known for queering

372
00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:46.260
horror a bit more with each installment
especially with 2004's Seed of Chucky

373
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.880
Glenn slash Glenda they them pronouns
child of Chucky and his doll bride

374
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.419
Tiffany was separated at Birth from
their parents in the final scene of

375
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:58.440
Bride of Chucky Mancini's use of the
names Glenn and Glenda for the character

376
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.600
calling back to the Edward classic Glenn
or Glenda six years after being born in

377
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.340
a New Jersey cemetery and being taken to
the UK by a cruel Puppet Master the

378
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.419
child now known as [ __ ] decides to
go in search of their parents in

379
00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:16.320
Hollywood after seeing commercials for a
film featuring two dolls with the same

380
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.960
made in Japan markings on their wrists
Glenn slash Glenda is mistaken for a boy

381
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.559
at first because of their haircut and
the way their Puppeteer refers to them

382
00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:29.520
but when Chucky and Tiffany finally get
to meet their offspring they get into an

383
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.720
argument over whether or not they should
be called Glenn or Glenda she just had

384
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.380
an accident
you mean

385
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.419
he had an accident even though Chucky
has chosen the name Glenn for his future

386
00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:46.799
child Tiffany insists that they be
called Glenda and I'm gonna call you

387
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:53.179
Glenn
the name is that for a girl your name is

388
00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:57.659
Glenda they pull down Glenn slash
blender's pants to show that they like

389
00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:02.100
all other dolls have nothing going on
down there this genitalia scene points

390
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.740
out the absurdity of choosing a child's
gender and how parents expectations and

391
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.779
desires get in the way of what a child
actually wants in a rather Progressive

392
00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:17.460
scene Tiffany and Chucky have a dialogue
with Glenn slash Glenda about who they

393
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:25.860
want to be I want a girl I want a boy
what about what I want well which is it

394
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.779
sometimes I feel like a boy
sometimes I feel like a girl no matter

395
00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:36.659
what happens we'll deal with it together
as a family as a result of their

396
00:31:36.659 --> 00:31:40.740
conversation Tiffany now supports her
child's non-binary gender expression

397
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:46.380
Noreen giffney and Myra J heard in
queering the non-human discuss just how

398
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.899
imperative this scene is in This
brilliant intersexual thematic gender

399
00:31:51.899 --> 00:31:56.580
legibility is shown to be important for
the parents not the child

400
00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.080
and the film foregrounds the ways in
which normative identity requires stable

401
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.700
gender in refusing to be either Glenn or
Glenda and insisting on being both

402
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.260
Chucky and Tiffany's kid focuses our
attention on the horrific effects of

403
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.820
heteronormativity and turns attention
away from the monstrosity of The

404
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.140
Ambiguously gendered body the queer
future of horror depicted in Glenn

405
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.140
Glenda is one that places a greater
emphasis on the problematic social

406
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:29.399
constructions of gender and the fact
that queer people and Dolls exist not to

407
00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:33.600
be a spectacle but to have truthful
narratives told about them the

408
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.039
monstrosity is in the way their parents
quarrel about their gender not in the

409
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:43.679
way Glenn slash Glenda looks or acts
Mancini utilizes Glenn slash Glenda to

410
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:47.820
show that a non-binary person is valid
and should be able to study their gender

411
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:52.200
identity and sexuality without the
influence of others rather than showing

412
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.360
the character as a horrific device
bodies belong to those who habit them

413
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.279
transgender and non-binary people exist
across the queer sexuality and gender

414
00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:08.640
spectrum and as such they should not be
forced into tiny acceptable boxes under

415
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.799
Mancini's Authority Seed of Chucky is
gloriously queer and refuses to paint

416
00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:18.360
trans and non-binary bodies as violent
and grotesque despite their physical

417
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.700
scary doll appearance Mancini continued
his queer inclusion with the following

418
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.640
Chucky films The Curse of Chucky in 2013
and Cult of Chucky in 2017 but most of

419
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.419
all in the new TV series simply titled
Chucky

420
00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:38.340
in which we find ourselves watching the
development of a sweet gay teen romance

421
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.080
in the middle of a horror show when 14
year old Jake wheeler gets his hands on

422
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.220
the titular possessed doll things get
interesting for the budding artist who

423
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.919
has a crush on classmate Devin Chucky
played once again by Brad Dourif and not

424
00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:56.700
the knockoff Mark Hamill version I love
Mark Hamill

425
00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.840
but no Chucky may still enjoy
ingeniously killing off his victims by

426
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.279
means of electrocution or throwing them
out of Windows or stabbing them but he

427
00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:08.700
also has a lot of heart and it's not
just a heart that he stole from somebody

428
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.139
else's body the show is fundamentally a
coming-of-age story despite being

429
00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:18.119
marketed as a coming-of-rage story and
Jake's developing queerness is presented

430
00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:22.919
as both instrumental and incidental to
the plot his first love just happens to

431
00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:27.300
be a boy while Chucky arguably
represents his inner turmoil when Jake's

432
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.220
drunken and violent father teases him
about his interests in dolls and his

433
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.240
tendency to spend time alone Jake or
tortz hi you don't care that they think

434
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.639
I'm weird
you just care that they know my

435
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:45.599
and then Chucky kills him
a lovely little inversion of the kill

436
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:50.220
your gaze Trope kill your homophobes
Chucky might say in episode 2 Chucky

437
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:56.159
points out that he has a queer kid a
call back to Glenn slash Glenda you know

438
00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:03.000
I have a queer kid you have a kid gender
fluid you're you're cool with it

439
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.440
I'm not a monster Jake and as we've come
to expect from the child's play

440
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.700
franchise since 1998's Bride of Chucky
introduced Jennifer Tilly to the series

441
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:17.400
the show is deliciously camp with Tilly
returning to chew the scenery and Fiona

442
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.200
Dora vying for her MVP Crown as a young
version of her father Brad's character

443
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.880
Charles Lee Ray the serial killer who's
transferred via blood magic into Chucky

444
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.380
Mancini has stated that he's infused his
work with a queer sensibility whether

445
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.579
through the use of black humor the
inclusion of queer supporting characters

446
00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:39.900
or the portrayal of Glenn slash glinda's
struggle to determine their gender

447
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.619
identity in Seed of Chucky Tilly
recalled how producers deemed Seed of

448
00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:47.339
Chucky which features John Waters a
Britney Spears look-alike and Hannah

449
00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:52.260
from S Club 7 getting killed off by the
doll to be too gay though they maybe

450
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.400
should have realized that when they had
a movie about a non-binary doll starring

451
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.300
Jennifer Tilly but in a genre with
queera tours such as screams Kevin

452
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.040
Williamson who says the Scream movies
are coded gay survival Hellraisers Clive

453
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.700
Barker and final destinations Jeffrey
Reddick queer references traditionally

454
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.599
had to be subtext that's one of the joys
of Chucky that it gives outright

455
00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:17.220
representation to slasher film fans who
previously had to find it piecemeal

456
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.200
where they could usually in villains who
could not identify with Jason a kid

457
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.040
bullied for being different and then
gets to come back and have his revenge

458
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.940
on the preppy jocks who made his
childhood a living hell but now

459
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:35.820
Chucky's Jake gets to do what very very
few have done before not only be a rare

460
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.680
final boy but one who makes it to the
end and gets the guy even though horror

461
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.980
has become much more diverse in recent
years there's still something queerly

462
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.839
revelatory about anchoring a 33 year old
stab-happy franchise a better killer

463
00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:54.540
doll to an adolescent gay love story
further cementing Chucky's Legacy as a

464
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.480
queer icon who quite literally slays

465
00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:10.079
queer people have developed an unusual
system of identification you see we

466
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:13.619
queers have always been reduced to
villains or worthless Side characters

467
00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:18.240
with little to no backbone because of
this terrible dearth of positive

468
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.260
representation
gay people have had to make a choice

469
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.579
identify with the side character or the
main villain and so we connect with

470
00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:32.040
these perceived evil characters because
of their overt or covert queerness such

471
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.599
as Dr pretorius from the Bride of
Frankenstein or Countess Maria's Alaska

472
00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:40.859
from Dracula's daughter we have become
accustomed to identifying with the

473
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:45.599
villain due to the fact that film has
historically repressed us and designated

474
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:50.160
us as scapegoats for villainy as a
result marginalized people desperate for

475
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.380
representation continue to adopt these
horror monsters as their own to

476
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.540
celebrate as anti-heroes final girls are
also being embraced by queer people who

477
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.760
want to be symbolized by powerful
empathetic androgynous Victors of

478
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.780
Oppression traits that are undoubtedly
familiar to many throughout the queer

479
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:15.180
Spectrum in horror the final girl is
typically portrayed as a heterosexual

480
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:19.560
cisgender white woman because straight
white faces have dominated horror films

481
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.060
from the earliest days of the silent
horror era the final girl's look has

482
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.940
been cliched and expected fans of horror
who are black Asian gay trans Hispanic

483
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.339
non-binary or any other race gender or
sexual orientation other than the stock

484
00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:39.420
model for the sole survivor and horror
films must find themselves within the

485
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.140
characterizations of the final girl in
films with little to no minority

486
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.180
representation despite her outward
appearance looking for representation

487
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:52.380
beyond the physical may be satisfying
for individuals particularly gay people

488
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:57.599
when one looks beyond the white female
face of the final girl one might find

489
00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:01.320
amazing personality qualities and
attributes that mirror the gay

490
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.480
experience the final girl may appear to
be a gorgeous face on the surface but on

491
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.900
the inside she is brimming with the
fortitude strength and persistence

492
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.400
required to fight monstrous slashers and
high school bullies qualities that many

493
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.020
queer people have gained in order to
thrive in a queerphobic world Carol J

494
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.420
Clover a cinema and gender historian and
Final girl specialist deconstructs what

495
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.820
a final girl means in the horror Canon
her Book Men Women in chainsaws provides

496
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.920
a hypothesis for what the Final Girl
implies in a horror film as well as the

497
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.240
characteristics that make her a feminist
hero the final girl is usually the only

498
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.160
character who is mentally developed with
wits and Brawn in times of peril and

499
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.780
finally beats the villain towards the
conclusion of the film audiences relate

500
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:53.280
with her since she is usually the lone
rational character even if she makes

501
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.599
mistakes along the way such as going up
the stairs instead of sprinting out the

502
00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:01.140
front door the final girl's humanity is
acknowledged

503
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.200
she is the one who brings down the
oppressor

504
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.720
and the crowd cheers her on Clover
explains that she is by any measure the

505
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:15.300
slasher film's hero the final girl has
not just manned herself she specifically

506
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.700
unmans the oppressor the Final Girl
holds the traits required not just to

507
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:26.160
preserve herself for No One generally
comes to her Aid but also to avenge all

508
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.119
those slaughtered and tormented by the
oppressor her bravery though is not

509
00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:34.320
gendered despite the name given to the
horror film survivors the final girl is

510
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.160
neither conventionally or
stereotypically feminine she is a hybrid

511
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.079
of masculine and female characteristics
as Clover states she alternates between

512
00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:47.880
registers of masculine and feminine from
the outset before her final struggle she

513
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.440
endures the deepest throws of femininity
and even during that final struggle she

514
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.660
is now weak and now strong
now flee's the Killer and now charges

515
00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.260
him now stabs and is stabbed now Cries
Out In Fear And now shouts in anger

516
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:09.420
she is a physical female and character
illogical Androgen the concept of the

517
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.460
final girl actually being non-binaries
kind of groundbreaking in terms of

518
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.480
gender queer identity films like Brian
De Palma's carry allow for

519
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.460
identification by mistreated Outsiders
who desire just to fit in but reach a

520
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.579
Breaking Point from which there's no
return

521
00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:30.900
Clover's theoretical final girl
perspective allows us to see clear-cut

522
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.640
final girls like Nancy Thompson in a
Nightmare on Elm Street in a new light

523
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.200
Nancy Thompson is a young high school
student struggling with the strange

524
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.460
death of her closest friend and
persistent dreams of a burnt man in a

525
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.440
red and green sweater Freddy Krueger the
infamous child killer although she looks

526
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.420
to be the adorable girl next door
Nancy's Talent stem from her bravery and

527
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.740
confronting Krueger in her nightmares
and her ability to bring him into the

528
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.160
real world when no one else would or
could

529
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.660
she outwits the adversary while also
fighting her oppressor physically

530
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.160
Heather langenkamp who plays Nancy in
the film spoke with gay times about the

531
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.700
significance of her role among gay
horror fans she was surprised to see

532
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.960
that many young gay men relate with
Nancy who they see as a crucial

533
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.220
character in the film series as a whole
more than langenkamp had anticipated

534
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:28.079
further more lesbian women can recognize
themselves in the All-American Girl Next

535
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:31.500
Door in the framework of Nancy's story
in the first Nightmare on Elm Street

536
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.599
film Nancy although having a boyfriend
rarely thinks of him romantically

537
00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:40.680
they're more than Pals pledging to
protect each other from the evil Freddy

538
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:46.020
Krueger but when Glenn tries to initiate
sex with a preoccupied Nancy at her best

539
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.740
friend Tina's Place early in the film
Nancy's comforting Tina while she's home

540
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.900
alone and plagued with fears of the man
in her nightmares Nancy stops him saying

541
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.920
not now

542
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:03.119
ourselves
Nancy is a character on a mission

543
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:07.980
to defend her friends while also killing
Freddy Krueger she has no time for

544
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:12.480
adolescent activities which is a
characteristic shared by practically all

545
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.880
final girls that's why they make it out
alive movies like A Nightmare on Elm

546
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.619
Street and Halloween which along with
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre kind of

547
00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:27.480
birthed the Final Girl archetype are not
meant to be queer nevertheless the

548
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.099
character of the final girl in each as
well as across the spectrum of Horror

549
00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:37.380
can be used as a vessel for queer
experience oppression and Hope the Final

550
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.020
Girl depicts a monstrous gender
a gender that splatters rips at the

551
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.599
seams and then is stitched back together
as something messier than male or female

552
00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:53.339
though Clover theorizes that the final
girl's Essence is non-binary her body

553
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:57.060
becomes a place where queer people of
All Sorts can project their experience

554
00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.640
and find solace in seeing themselves
Triumph on screen and their tormentors

555
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.339
whatever or whomever the Tormentor
represents to them

556
00:44:07.339 --> 00:44:11.160
perish
by their own queer hand

557
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.460
Joshua Anderson in his essay the Final
Girl an lgbtq representation states that

558
00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.359
the journey through that confusion of
coming to terms with your sexuality is

559
00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:26.579
in essence the journey that these final
girls take when they are chased and

560
00:44:26.579 --> 00:44:31.740
battered almost to the brink of death
for those of us who grew up in a world

561
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.540
where what we were learning about
ourselves was considered immorally or

562
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:41.040
internally wrong queer people in their
bodies have been utilized by and for

563
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.480
horror for over a century the bodies of
queer horror characters bruised and

564
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.220
bleeding had largely witnessed abuse and
Scorn their lives utilized for Wicked

565
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.119
actions or malicious laughter the
growing identification of queer people

566
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:57.780
with the Final Girl represents a
psychological need to repair the damage

567
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:03.180
that horror has inflicted on queer
bodies and Minds in the past as well as

568
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.680
a need to reclaim a genre that has
explicit queer Roots but lost sight of

569
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.880
such roots
somewhere in the 20th century this drive

570
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.319
for reclamation
is a reaction to the bullying of queer

571
00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:21.619
people in horror films and Society in
general

572
00:45:26.839 --> 00:45:31.440
horrific fiction has traditionally found
a fertile ground in the fear of

573
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.180
femininity it's the driving force behind
The Exorcist in which a male demon takes

574
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.800
over a girl's body and transforms her
into a muttering twisted and

575
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.540
self-mutilating Monster
Rosemary and Rosemary's Baby is pregnant

576
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.040
but not with a human child she wants
instead she is a host for the son of the

577
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.900
devil when she realizes this she takes
drastic action by changing her hairstyle

578
00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:00.119
from a demure Bob to a harsh boyish
pixie

579
00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:04.079
which her complicit husband publicly
condemns movies like this transform

580
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:08.040
natural processes like puberty and
pregnancy into Tales of demonic Invasion

581
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.380
by imbuing them with satanic potency
they use the same method that was used

582
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.800
to make the monsters in Silence of the
Lambs and psycho

583
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.319
only backward the trans feminine is a
common theme in many horror films with

584
00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:26.819
characters like Buffalo Bill preying on
young girls for their skin and Norman

585
00:46:26.819 --> 00:46:31.740
Bates killing as his mother to prevent
trans feminine persons from using

586
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:37.980
women's restrooms and shelters turfs and
far-right fear mongers invoke the image

587
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.599
of the wild
predatory transphalus fear of the

588
00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:46.740
transmasculine a group far more
dismissed by Society has been rarely

589
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.599
voiced in mainstream Publications before
recently nevertheless transmasculinity

590
00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:56.819
is still a breach of gender norms and
since it most frequently affects people

591
00:46:56.819 --> 00:47:01.619
who have uteruses and so have the
capacity to produce children

592
00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:05.900
it elicits a special kind of fear that
is cloaked in

593
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:11.400
condescending compassion a particularly
contentious report from Jessie's single

594
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.720
attempts to argue that it has become too
easy for young trans people to begin

595
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:21.780
gender confirmation procedures that some
young people may be misdiagnosing severe

596
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.079
gender dysphoria as something less
serious

597
00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:30.599
such as sadness anxiety or patriarchal
oppression meanwhile I've spoken to

598
00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:35.579
trans people who took so long to start
their transition because Society had

599
00:47:35.579 --> 00:47:41.099
convinced them that their dysphoria was
all just internalized misogyny at the

600
00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:44.940
same side I have read testimonies from a
number of trans people who figured out

601
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.680
that they were trans because of gender
Euphoria not dysphoria as though the

602
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.440
subjective experience of gender were a
nefarious opaque mystery he asks where

603
00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.420
is the line between not feeling like a
girl because society makes it difficult

604
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.800
to be a girl and needing hormones to
alleviate dysphoria that otherwise won't

605
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.220
go away in a particularly revealing
thought

606
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.540
single rights that kids who go on
puberty blockers and then on cross-sex

607
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.800
hormones may not be able to have
biological children as though the life

608
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.400
of a theoretical future child matters
more than the life of a potentially

609
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.920
trans but certainly already living child
2018's hereditary plays upon the fears

610
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.540
single stirs up the film's villain
Charlie loses their grandmother at the

611
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.740
start of the film after the funeral
their mother Annie checks in on them in

612
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.160
a scene in which Charlie reveals that
their grandmother wanted them to be a

613
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.339
boy
but their mother responds as though

614
00:48:41.339 --> 00:48:45.660
she's heard something else something
like I want to be a boy

615
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.319
declaring that they were a tomboy
growing up but in the end they got over

616
00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:54.180
it we never see Charlie interact with
their grandmother so we never find out

617
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.660
exactly why she felt like they were
supposed to be a boy

618
00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.720
but Charlie makes it quite apparent that
they feel

619
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.800
disconnected from their physical form
they have an extreme allergy to nuts

620
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.140
walk in a shuffle don't look at people
directly create Effigies out of garbage

621
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.579
and constantly click their tongue their
mother feels they need to be socialized

622
00:49:14.579 --> 00:49:18.300
so their older brother Peter reluctantly
brings them to a party where they stand

623
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.440
out like a sore thumb
an awkward 13 year old

624
00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.579
in a knee-length orange sweatshirt
clutching to their brother because they

625
00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:30.180
don't know what else to do
Peter forces Charlie to eat chocolate

626
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.280
cake so he and his Crush can get high
but there's walnuts in that cake and

627
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.240
Charlie's throat begins to constrict and
they barge in and beg for help from

628
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.940
their brother who's in the middle of a
bong hit

629
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.079
in his haste to get them to the hospital
he swerves around a dead deer and

630
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:50.160
decapitates Charlie on a telephone pole
as they were leaning out the window for

631
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.060
air in a horrified Haze Peter travels
home

632
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.780
goes to sleep
and awakens to his mother's cries of

633
00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.500
anguish
the camera cuts from Peter's anguished

634
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.660
face to an indelible shot of Charlie's
severed head swarming with ants but

635
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.400
Charlie's beheading was no accident it
was part of a ceremony to free them from

636
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.599
their body and reveal their true
identity as pymon the eighth king of

637
00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:18.839
hell
they get occult's help to torment Peter

638
00:50:18.839 --> 00:50:23.460
into a possessed State at which point
they take over his body

639
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.560
as Peter Charlie clicks his tongue to
show that he is now in control slowly he

640
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.339
makes his way up to his tree house where
his cult members are waiting to anoint

641
00:50:32.339 --> 00:50:35.579
him King
one of the cult's leaders assures

642
00:50:35.579 --> 00:50:40.380
Charlie that he is okay now
Charlie now in the body of Peter gazes

643
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.319
just beyond the camera mouth slightly a
gape

644
00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:47.160
he does not look afraid
if anything

645
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.880
he seems for the first time to be at
home

646
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.720
the fact that Charlie's transition calls
for such Extreme Measures of physical

647
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.760
violence reflects a residual fear among
many CIS people the transition is a type

648
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:04.619
of Mutilation and at worst a kind of
death the sloughing off of one body in

649
00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:08.819
exchange for a new different one those
who identify as trans masculine may have

650
00:51:08.819 --> 00:51:12.599
their desire to transition misunderstood
as a magnetic draw away from the

651
00:51:12.599 --> 00:51:16.440
submissive gender and toward the
dominant one

652
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.540
a power play rather than an act to feel
whole as a person if hereditary were a

653
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.079
typical drama it would simply follow the
family disillusion surrounding the

654
00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:29.640
transition of a child the over-dramatic
concept of a person dying and a new one

655
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.260
being born a fantastically fictitious
morning process that so many CIS people

656
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.460
say they have to go through when friends
or family transition but because it's a

657
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:44.579
horror movie we get actual death murder
possession and a literal king of Hell a

658
00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:48.300
queer person is never given more power
than within the scenes of a horror movie

659
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:53.300
and if hereditary says anything about
the trans experience

660
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.440
it's that it's a hell of a lot easier to
change your body

661
00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.760
than to change your soul

662
00:52:07.079 --> 00:52:11.640
in March of 2020
as the world failed to prepare for the

663
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.500
coming covid-19 pandemic
so did Hollywood the film industry's

664
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.059
reaction was for the most part to Simply
shut down for months movie theaters were

665
00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:24.960
deserted and many customers didn't
return to theaters at all the following

666
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.619
year since streaming services had taken
over the void traditional Studios had

667
00:52:28.619 --> 00:52:33.900
left empty in response several companies
shifted their focus to online streaming

668
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.859
and video on demand Services among the
earliest horror films to make the quick

669
00:52:37.859 --> 00:52:42.300
transition from theaters to streaming
was freaky which originally opened in

670
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:46.020
cinemas in October of 2020 and then
became available on streaming services

671
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:50.520
two months later slasher comedy freaky
directed by Christopher Landon of happy

672
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:55.319
death day includes Josh the
protagonist's gay best friend in the

673
00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:59.280
history of horror having a gay best
friend is Not Unusual the non-binary

674
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.859
actor Misha oshirovich who played Josh
said my character is a gay best friend

675
00:53:04.859 --> 00:53:10.559
but also a commentary on the gay best
friend both they and Nyla an

676
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:14.099
African-American character who befriends
the protagonist are depicted as

677
00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:18.720
independent characters who highlight the
genre's history of discrimination in one

678
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.099
scene Josh says to Nyla as the slasher
that once took the form of Vince Vaughn

679
00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:26.220
now inhabits the body of their best
friend Millie and is on a murderous

680
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.680
Rampage you're black I'm gay we are so
dead filmmakers in the horror genre now

681
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.940
have a Keener understanding of Their
audience and make no deliberate effort

682
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.200
to turn away from underrepresented
groups the slasher movies Halloween

683
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.059
kills and the new Candyman both feature
gay male couples although in each film

684
00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:49.500
only one of them survives to the end
horror fans know that Killers don't care

685
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:54.420
who they kill but what makes these two
films Stand Out is the attention paid to

686
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:58.500
the relationships between these couples
queer bodies are no longer a source of

687
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:04.680
Terror queer bodies were exploited to
shock terrify and make audiences laugh

688
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:09.140
during the bulk of the 20th century
there were punching bags sissies

689
00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:14.760
Phantoms and ghosts monsters beneath the
bed and in the closet queer horror

690
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.260
Figures were rarely much more than
fodder for American gay Terror over the

691
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.400
last two decades though a new queer era
has emerged in which queer people in

692
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.180
horror May gain empathy from viewers
however in order to comprehend the

693
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:31.200
decade's significance previous failures
and accomplishments must be remembered

694
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.859
horror films are historical time
capsules whether it's aliens

695
00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:38.640
representing foreigners vampires
representing sexually promiscuous

696
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.420
disease carriers or vicious serial
killers

697
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.760
each picture represents the concerns of
the day looking back at the history of

698
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.099
horror queer people will undoubtedly see
how we were utilized for violence

699
00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:59.400
humor sympathy and Dread
however if a queer person looks deeper

700
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.240
it will find themselves as they have in
the pages of History

701
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.800
as survivors
final girls final boys and final people

702
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.400
in which to place themselves more
victoriously

703
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.020
than in the monsters that American
society has tried to turn them into and

704
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.160
at the same time
perhaps we can own the power of the

705
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.319
cisgender straight majority accidentally
gave to us via the movie Monster

706
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:29.579
the slasher returning from the grave to
take revenge on the heteronormative

707
00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:34.980
stand-in of the day
the monster created by society and then

708
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:39.240
disowned by it
the Misunderstood Beast looking for its

709
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.859
brood
we are and always have been the heroes

710
00:55:43.859 --> 00:55:50.160
of our own stories
even if we were the monsters and theirs

711
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:56.339
and so we made the monsters the hero
and now we've even taken ownership of

712
00:55:56.339 --> 00:55:59.780
the Gilded Heroes themselves

713
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.760
we are the monsters
we are the heroes

714
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:10.200
and no matter how many times they think
they've beaten us

715
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.880
we always get up
one

716
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.480
