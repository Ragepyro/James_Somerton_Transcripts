[Music]

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
so I've noticed that a lot of people in
the comments take issue with my use of

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.420
the word queer in respect to the whole
Squad of CIS hetero hegemony resistance

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.660
some people have told me to just use
LGBT others have said to Simply say gay

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
for the whole crew because that's not
exclusionary at all

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
so seeing as how I apparently love
nothing more than poking Bears on the

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.399
internet I wanted to explain my
rationale behind this

9
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.860
which
ended up going a lot deeper than I

10
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.030
expected
shocker

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:01:06.170
[Music]

12
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:35.880
[Music]
okay so LGBT this as a term started

13
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
being used in 1988 by some small groups
in the United States but didn't gain

14
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.500
mainstream use until the late 1990s
though it started out as G LBT because

15
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.740
gay men were running most of the
organizations and of course we had to

16
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.500
come first and then LGB because what the
hell is a trans person but eventually

17
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
LGBT became the accepted acronym mainly
because it could refer to the community

18
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840
without any words that might trigger The
Straits

19
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.940
like lesbian okay or bisexual or
transgender

20
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.980
you know not people just letters
but as you can see from the initial

21
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
evolution of the term it has its
problems mainly that it in any use is

22
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.700
naturally exclusionary the only widely
agreed upon abbreviation is LGBT though

23
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.500
many people will use lgbtq or lgbtqia or
lgbtqia Plus or what's common here in

24
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.800
Canada lgbtqia 2s Plus
however when it comes to branding any

25
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.239
word longer than four syllables is an
absolute no-go and there's years of

26
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.760
market research to back this up so
mostly you wouldn't normally hear anyone

27
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.060
outside the community using anything
more than LGBT even though I've seen

28
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.560
some people use
lgbtq i p d o g s a a plus lesbian gay

29
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860
bisexual transgender transsexual queer
questioning intersex pansexual

30
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.019
demisexual omnisexual genderqueer
straight asexual Ally Plus

31
00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.879
JFC right now this is all in the name of
being as inclusive as possible which is

32
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.260
good we people of the alphabet soup are
excluded from enough spaces we don't

33
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.620
need to be [ __ ] and exclude each
other that goes there to the people with

34
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.239
just LGB listed in their Twitter
profiles but the thing is our community

35
00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.140
has so many small niches of
self-identification that no matter what

36
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.340
version of alphabet soup you're using in
casual language you will likely be

37
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
excluding someone and then you get to
situations where people at Pride

38
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.720
festivals have to use some version of
the full thing seven or eight times in a

39
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.220
speech that's neither practical nor does
it accomplish the desired effect of

40
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.840
inclusion because you've either left a
letter out or someone has stopped

41
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.560
listening and thinks that you've left a
letter out because you've been reciting

42
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.739
a more complicated version of the ABCs
for the last

43
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.480
forever furthermore it opens up a door
for Selective and deliberate exclusion

44
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.920
as I mentioned with the LGB people on
Twitter or the G's and the L's who don't

45
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.480
want to acknowledge anyone else or a
society of allies that will Swoon at the

46
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.120
progress of lgbtqia plus representation
when there's actually just

47
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.240
gay people being represented or one
lesbian and half a scene and as an

48
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.259
anxious person who makes videos for and
about this community I can say that I

49
00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.400
fully understand the amount of energy
put into overthinking if a given script

50
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.660
is leaving out a letter after spending
weeks writing and shooting a video just

51
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.100
to start editing and realizing I forgot
a letter because someone will get angry

52
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.740
at me for not including gender
non-conforming demisexual straight

53
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.600
allies this complaint is based on a true
YouTube comment and not to play the

54
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.960
gatekeeper but I'm not entirely
comfortable with having an a for allies

55
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.520
for a few reasons I've never heard an
ally refer to themselves as part of the

56
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.699
community I haven't heard a straight
person say I'm lgbtqia or check that off

57
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.479
on a survey as an identity option it's
like when expecting parents say we are

58
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.660
pregnant
no if a cisman is involved in this

59
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.680
process that is literally impossible
girls I know you want to make a complete

60
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.759
family and you want him to be involved
but he's not pregnant he's not up at 4

61
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.360
30 a.m puking his guts up he doesn't
have to stretch his dick hole out the

62
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.320
size of a coconut he doesn't have the
back problems the food cravings the

63
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.940
lifelong stretch marks unless he's trans
or non-binary and you've both hit the

64
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.820
baby batter at the same time
then yes you could both be pregnant

65
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.039
but not usually anyway allies I am
grateful for straight people who support

66
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.759
us and I'm grateful that straight people
recognize how amazing this community can

67
00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.600
be at its best so much so that they
steal our culture any chance they get

68
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.600
and I am so grateful
straight guys in my life

69
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.440
who have been perfectly comfortable with
me staring at their asses thing is you

70
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.380
can go back to your straight lives
anytime you like you can be with us

71
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.060
while we come out be there to support us
but you don't experience it you don't

72
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.600
internalize the emotions or the
circumstances surrounding it maybe

73
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.660
straight CIS women have a better
understanding of what it's like because

74
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.500
they too come from a culture which
historically likes to Badger them into

75
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.180
certain expectations but even then
they've never had to sit their family

76
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.600
down and reveal that they've actually
been a woman this whole time at the end

77
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.800
of the day being an ally is a choice
regardless if it's a choice that you've

78
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.639
made because you just can't stand
Injustice it's still an action that you

79
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.800
chose this doesn't necessarily fit the
whole branding image that we queers are

80
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.600
as mother monster once sang Born This
Way But consistency

81
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.539
is a whole other problem with the
lgbtqip

82
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.259
so LG not the TV sexualities you like
people who have the same gender

83
00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.600
appearance I mean there's problems with
that but we'll get into that a bit then

84
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.380
you have bisexual which used to mean
that you liked everyone

85
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.979
but then as we started to include gender
non-conformists into the larger

86
00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.240
awareness of gender identity it meant
that you only liked people who binarily

87
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.620
identified as men or women
and now it seems that you can like

88
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.099
everyone again or not it depends on who
you ask so right after B comes T which

89
00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.940
being trans has nothing to do with who
you want to have sex with a big problem

90
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.560
I've seen in the past among the sishats
is that a lot of people seem to be under

91
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.620
the impression that transgender is
actually a sexuality

92
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.880
are they willfully ignorant or simply
misinformed

93
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.979
debatable after that tea we have another
T this one stands for transsexual which

94
00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.419
some say is different from transgender
While others say it's just an older term

95
00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:55.680
meaning the same thing I'm sis so I'll
leave that argument up to other people

96
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.960
so after the t's we have q which itself
is ambiguous Q stands for queer or

97
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.860
sometimes questioning but usually queer
which is used as a placeholder and a

98
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.500
catch-all for everything that isn't
already described

99
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.880
which then is kind of redundant because
the letters after it go on to be more

100
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.680
specific then you get I I stands for
intersex which is neither a sexuality

101
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.180
and not necessarily an identity more
specifically it's a physiological

102
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.020
phenomenon as the phenotypical result of
chromosome combinations beyond the

103
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:31.740
simple x x and XY binary which
Jesus Christ biology so in genetics a

104
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.839
phenotype is the set of observable
characteristics or traits of an organism

105
00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:40.380
the term covers the organism's
morphology or physical form and

106
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.520
structure its developmental processes
it's biochemical and physiological

107
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.779
properties Its Behavior and the products
of said Behavior among humans in this

108
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:53.940
context it basically means are you
visually identifiable as male or female

109
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.140
but intersex means that you're not
technically male or female on a

110
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.740
biological level
though you likely present as one or the

111
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.399
other which really gets under the skin
of the gender critical types who are

112
00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:09.600
married to the idea that male and female
are etched in stone you'd think that

113
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.680
given that this has been a documented
component of biology and almost all

114
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.180
species that gender critical folks would
piss off because it is proof positive

115
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.019
that human beings do not exist
exclusively on a male female binary but

116
00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.080
they're dumb and don't understand
biology despite their propensity to

117
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.220
pretend that they're biologists and I'm
greatly simplifying here for the sake of

118
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.380
time anyway a as I mentioned this means
allies or at least it did now there's

119
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.920
two ways because it could also mean
asexual which is a far more valid a to

120
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.459
have on the list but a lot of people are
reluctant to let asexuals into the inner

121
00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:46.320
Circles of lgbtism the thought process
goes well if you're asexual then your

122
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.880
sexuality has no influence on your daily
life so GTFO it doesn't help that the

123
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.019
asexual or Ace Community itself is
splintered where the vast majority of

124
00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:59.100
non-asexual people think they're
completely sexless and the vast majority

125
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.180
of media depicts them as emotionless
robots who are usually autistic when in

126
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.459
reality yes you do have the no sex folks
but also the very specific circumstances

127
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:12.300
folks and the only people I'm
emotionally attracted to folks and the

128
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.560
people I have no emotional attraction to
folks the phone sex only the cyber sex

129
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.940
only the I just like to watch and the
high libido asexual folks who have a

130
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.120
barrel of Ky next to their bed and
several terabytes of porn and within the

131
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.140
community itself there is gatekeeping
going on that's trying to say who on the

132
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:34.320
aforementioned list is a real asexual
then there's 2s or two-spirited which I

133
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.620
gotta say I love that North American
Pride organizations are acting like

134
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.740
their next level woke for their minimal
amount of effort to include First

135
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.300
Nations people because you know actually
going out of your way to help First

136
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.880
Nations people economically and or
socially would simply be absurd oh you'd

137
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.640
like help getting out of the giant
economic hole that we've put you in or

138
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.320
maybe help stopping native women being
murdered every other night how about a

139
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.700
new stripe on the pride flag instead
anyway throwing 2s into the mix is an

140
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.360
ice gesture
if nothing else though it does project

141
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.320
an idea of pre-colonial pan-americanism
where the whole of Native American

142
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.060
people represent a single monolithic
culture when in fact it was composed of

143
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.779
hundreds of tribes and languages North
America had more disparate native

144
00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:22.140
cultures than Europe had white ones but
it's hard to acknowledge that now

145
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.620
because the English Dutch and French
genocided entire nations without a

146
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.420
second thought white people which cue
the I'm not like other white people

147
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.220
speeches from the ones who read a book
about First Nations beliefs in

148
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.160
spiritualism and then hang a
dreamcatcher on the wall you want to be

149
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.600
spiritual white people there are other
religions you know pray to Jupiter or

150
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.220
Odin there's all kinds of gods and
deities to pray to from Europe instead

151
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.959
of appropriating the beliefs of victims
of genocide we could give sermons to pan

152
00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:57.000
speaking of pan Which can also be short
for pansexual which is the p in the LGBT

153
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.700
mess
essentially pansexual means that you're

154
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.120
attracted to anyone no matter how they
present on the gender Spectrum bottom

155
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.600
line is that the whole abbreviation
which it stopped being an abbreviation

156
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.279
about eight letters ago it's a big long
jumbled confusing mess of this isn't

157
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:15.360
really straight which caps off with some
cultural appropriation

158
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.820
especially when you attack on the plus
at the end of it what's the Plus for

159
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.779
some people say it's for HIV positive
folks which is good but a lot of people

160
00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.279
in the community don't want to include
positive people so it's taken to be read

161
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:32.160
as just
Plus

162
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.040
like plus whoever else comes along which
isn't that what the queue is for it

163
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.760
seems to me the more we as the people of
the alphabet soup continue to identify

164
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.459
as things other than simply LGBT and or
t the more messy the acronym becomes

165
00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:53.070
but cleaning it up isn't so simple
[Music]

166
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.560
foreign
another big reason why I dislike the

167
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.579
LGBT label is that it is a very
fragmented collection of identities

168
00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:06.540
we're adding new letters to the mix all
the time as we carry on the old ones

169
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.320
which more research we do the more we're
indicating that our initial assumptions

170
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.700
about gender and sexuality were false
all right history lesson

171
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.540
so homosexuality was a term coined in
the late 19th century but didn't

172
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.160
actually achieve widespread use until
the mid-1900s this is a distinct sort of

173
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.540
switch in the way people thought about
sex acts between those of the same

174
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.980
physiological sex homosexual is a term
which refers to an individual and thus

175
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.060
paints same-sex attraction as an
intrinsic element of one's personality

176
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.019
but earlier phrases tell a different
story through most of christianized

177
00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:44.880
Europe the descriptor was sodomites in
reference to the act of sodomy or also

178
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.380
tributism when referring to two women
later would come sexual inversion or

179
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.720
sexual deviants I like that second one
and yes queer was a term used but more

180
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.200
so to describe someone of a certain set
of behaviors in the same language as

181
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.519
dandeism in England though queer was a
bit more of a negative term it wasn't

182
00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.620
explicitly derogatory though until the
late 1800s in the American Northwest

183
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:12.200
whereas Dandy was more of an endearment
queer in English just means weird

184
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.740
strange or outside the ordinary the key
difference was that before the budding

185
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.720
field of psychology sprung up around the
turn of the 20th century gay sex was an

186
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.940
action which led to engaging in gay sex
as a lifestyle Freud Kinsey and other

187
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.100
psychologists and sexologists sought not
only to draw people into categories but

188
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.660
also ascribe actions of an individual's
daily life to an inner fixed state of

189
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.740
personhood basically queer had been
something you did but now queer was

190
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.100
something that you were for whatever
good intention these researchers may

191
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.600
have had the public interpreted this
knowledge as there was now a category of

192
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.260
people for whom God-fearing
heteronormativity he was something they

193
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:58.500
were completely incapable of due to
their fixed psychological condition as a

194
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.680
homosexual I try to explain this to
people sometimes and they don't quite

195
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.760
realize just how much of a fundamental
shift in understanding this was consider

196
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.500
that criminal persecution was focused on
the specific Act of sodomy and fellatio

197
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.699
and that a sense of justice among the
public was rooted in punishing the

198
00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:18.540
person who committed the act the
antagonism was directed at the act of

199
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.040
sex but following psychological
qualifications the antagonism was now

200
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.959
directed at the individual the
individual was homosexual it was

201
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:32.040
intrinsic to one's sense of being in
fact Freud's writings on the topic

202
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.459
stated that homosexuality was not
something someone was born with but the

203
00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:39.000
result of a snag in early age
psychological development and while he

204
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.019
did believe that was no fault of the
individual it was still considered to be

205
00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:47.160
a kind of defect or malformity basically
he thought we were the sexual version of

206
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.540
the Elephant Man but Freud was office
rocker and we don't have to take what he

207
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.560
said seriously but he was pivotal in
shifting a societal understanding of

208
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.160
queerness where anybody could be
homosexual if it was an element of

209
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.880
Developmental personhood or genetic
determinism then there might be no

210
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.180
apparent indication of this person's
queerness they could be hiding anywhere

211
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.339
suddenly the crime of being gay was not
the actual Act of sex but a matter of

212
00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:17.820
being your actions were not illegal you
were illegal which correct me if I'm off

213
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.899
base here but
that seems a whole lot worse to me

214
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.959
at least from an internally
psychological level think of the way

215
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:29.279
that changed how we think of ourselves
for instance in Europe up until around

216
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:33.240
the early 1900s male male sex was seen
as something that every man was capable

217
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.860
of doing this is obvious in early
English writings about Italy where

218
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.600
wealthy parents were informed not to let
their sons travel there because the much

219
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.320
more sexually fluid Italian Catholic
boys would corrupt Englishmen into

220
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.740
same-sex engagements
because the gays could spread it

221
00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:55.320
though even this was subject to vast
variants across Europe in terms of

222
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.339
attitudes towards sexuality the
prevailing concept of homosexuality was

223
00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:03.240
taken for granted some guys like to
point other guys whether that was okay

224
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.900
or not dependent upon where you lived
and What social class you were in though

225
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.199
the thought process about sexuality as
being part of identity didn't really

226
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:13.740
factor into the question in fact
sexuality as a term and a concept wasn't

227
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.459
even used to describe what gender or sex
you were attracted to the subject of

228
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:21.299
someone's sexuality was a description of
their sexual habits which yes could be

229
00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:25.439
same-sex attraction but more likely
we're going to be talking about what

230
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:28.439
Kinks they were into and if you're
wondering why this section is so

231
00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:32.340
man-centric this is because the vast
majority of legal persecution of early

232
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.960
queers was focused on men firstly there
was just much less legal effort when it

233
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.740
came to documenting women in general
we're missing information on that front

234
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.360
so we can't really speak to it secondly
information about early lesbians kind of

235
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.340
results in men not really being willing
to talk about it in the legal case of

236
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.700
Radcliffe Hall she in her book The Well
of Loneliness depicted World War One

237
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.100
ambulance drivers as being primarily
lesbians English courts were really not

238
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.360
pleased with this depiction but women
who love women with such an

239
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.919
uncomfortable topic for them they threw
her case out of the courts and just let

240
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:11.700
her carry on in her happy life which is
mostly me trying to apologize for not

241
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.720
having as much fem on Femme content in
this video here have some Sarah ponsby

242
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.520
and Lady Eleanor Butler and their dog
sappho

243
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:31.559
[Music]
so the term homosexual was developed as

244
00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:35.640
a term to reclassify an element of
culture that had existed since the dawn

245
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.660
of time in many pre-christian cultures
men boinking other men was simply an

246
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.780
element of the culture itself it was
seen as a deterministic inevitability

247
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.620
yeah we knew that Spartans were going to
Spartan but the more research is done

248
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.860
into ancient cultures the more we
learned that it was perfectly acceptable

249
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.600
to be in an openly male male
relationship we're also learning that

250
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.640
these ancient cultures did not in fact
place any stigma on bottoming Achilles

251
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.539
was a power bottom archaeological
anthropology as a whole is giving us a

252
00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:07.020
version of history in which
pre-christianized societies had no

253
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.080
specific language for making a
distinction between same-sex and

254
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.100
heterosexual relationships as well being
very comfortable with members of society

255
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.660
who did not conform to gender binaries
to a much greater degree than we've ever

256
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.919
been willing to admit or aware of
Vikings and Celts and Goths didn't see

257
00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:26.520
any reason to develop a descriptive
language for queerness because they

258
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.240
didn't see queer people as being
incompatible with how these societies

259
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.740
functioned being queer didn't mean you
couldn't build boats raise livestock

260
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.960
fight Wars or command fleets
in many cases gender non-conformity also

261
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.160
had positions within Society across
multiple societies homosexuality was

262
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.240
actually a term coined and pushed by
non-queer academics and regardless of

263
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.960
their intentions and regardless of how
it has shaped the progression toward

264
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.940
queer rights it itself is an invented
term but we keep celebrating this

265
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.620
concept of homosexuality as an inherent
truth when even our ancestors who were

266
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.539
queer friendly would have looked at it
as such a strange rigid qualification

267
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.020
and especially because it was used by
others to describe the group of us

268
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.520
rather than us opting to Define
ourselves the creation of the word gave

269
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.720
homosexual men and women something to
call ourselves an identity not just a

270
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.140
descriptor but we didn't come up with it
and now just look at the writing on the

271
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.980
wall every passing generation has a
growing number of people who identify as

272
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.960
bi or pansexual every year psychological
research tells us that sexuality and

273
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.100
gender are getting more and more fluid
and that outside of social conditioning

274
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.140
a lot of people don't really have strict
rules about gender attraction at all

275
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.640
which
is going to end up adding a lot more

276
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.559
letters the alternative is what we have
now I see a major cultural push to

277
00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:53.760
funnel people into a limited finite
number of acceptable identities which

278
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.200
have been pre-approved by The Straits
you'll notice a pattern that queer folks

279
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.700
who the straights are still comfortable
bullying are those who choose not to fit

280
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.299
into one of the very reasonable
selections that they've been offered

281
00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:10.740
it's an expected compromise yes the
Straits will let us get married but only

282
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.820
if we exist as the kind of gaze that
they're okay with which should be a bit

283
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.900
off-putting to the alphabet soup people
around us who don't like the word queer

284
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.940
the straights control what is okay what
we can call ourselves do you realize how

285
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.080
many other things they've called us
which were in objective sense probably

286
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:35.159
way more dehumanizing and sometimes just
stupid like yeah they've called us

287
00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:39.539
but I can't in my right mind imagine
being upset at being called a cream puff

288
00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:44.820
like if someone calls me a cream puff
there's just gonna be a big old okay

289
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.559
Boomer eye roll and
whenever someone tries to insult me with

290
00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:53.039
queer
then I just feel bad that they're so

291
00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:56.340
disconnected from the modern world that
they resort to an outdated insult

292
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.580
there's a point where someone is so
disconnected from reality that they

293
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.900
don't matter anymore let's take a moment
to remember the archaic and forgotten

294
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:09.559
insults to queer people
[Music]

295
00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:14.280
and this is the wonderful part about
language things change do you think it

296
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.340
matters that the original definition of
ultimate meant that it was just

297
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.179
something at the end of a list no people
don't give a [ __ ] they're gonna say

298
00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:26.880
ultimate because it means awesome best
biggest incredible amazing show-stopping

299
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.780
spectacular words don't have any
inherent value they mean what we think

300
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.980
they mean so if everyone thinks that
queer is an insult that's what it

301
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.400
becomes and besides if you've got a
younger group of gabies growing up with

302
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.820
a positive take on the word queer why do
you want to tell them that it's a bad

303
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.140
word why do you want people to feel more
oppressed than they already do like I

304
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.200
get that you don't like the word
probably for some very valid reasons

305
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.460
that we'll get into but it was never the
word that was attacking you it was the

306
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:59.700
homophobe the religious zealot the bigot
words themselves don't mean anything but

307
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.539
they carry meaning and if you choose to
see this word as carrying hatred and

308
00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:07.080
bigotry especially when this is a word
that is largely outside of the realm of

309
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.520
common use you are choosing to carry the
pain and suffering from your past into

310
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.580
the present
and given shifting attitudes toward

311
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.440
queer folk in many places in the world
that is pain and suffering that does not

312
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.760
need to be here which we can certainly
do without though we're going to face

313
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.600
some difficulties from the older
generations of people who have grown up

314
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.440
in a world where you were meant to shape
your entire identity around your

315
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.760
sexuality either in Conformity to
stereotypes or in spite of them and to

316
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.080
them I don't really have anything
reassuring to say we're not living in

317
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.860
the same world that we were and the
younger generations of gay and trans

318
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.840
babies have every right to Define
themselves as you fought for the right

319
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.120
to Define yourselves it would be a bit
hypocritical of us to turn around and

320
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.020
say
um no actually we defined ourselves this

321
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:03.299
way so you have to Define yourself the
same way especially as the way we

322
00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:06.659
defined ourselves as insufficient to
describe developments and how we are

323
00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:10.620
coming to discover and ReDiscover gender
and sexual expression

324
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.620
foreign

325
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:19.980
[Music]
the word queer is already being widely

326
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.720
adopted despite resistance by the old
guard in academic circles queer theory

327
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.220
is the term used by many within social
and literary criticism because you know

328
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.520
a bunch of literate queers wanted to
qualify the interactive and reactive

329
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.419
elements within the many factions of
queer culture and their relation to the

330
00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:40.559
hetero world and if a room full of
pig-headed academics can agree the queer

331
00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:43.980
is a term that can apply to the room as
a whole

332
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.520
maybe it's something we should think
about have you ever been in a room with

333
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.820
an academic
you can't even agree with themselves but

334
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.059
regardless of this not only is queer
useful as a description of the

335
00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:59.039
overarching collection of often Misfit
identities it's entirely appropriate to

336
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.400
repurpose an archaic insult into
something that can be interpreted by

337
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.640
many as a positive so my big question to
everyone who doesn't like the idea is

338
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.520
why do you want to make a world
with more negativity in it if queer is

339
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.260
an insult then that's just one more
negative word in the world

340
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.520
straight people took an otherwise
unremarkable word removed it from word

341
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.720
neutrality and made it into something
malignant and by us allowing that word

342
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.159
to continue to be a negative not only
are we perpetuating that hatred but we

343
00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:36.059
are giving straight people an insane
amount of power

344
00:25:36.059 --> 00:25:41.100
over how we the queers identify
ourselves why should the Straits

345
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.120
influence us so much
we should be influencing them by

346
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.440
shifting queer into the category of
exclusive language like many of you

347
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.580
constantly harass me about you are
letting a negative toxic hetero hegemony

348
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.880
limit your language
if you want to limit your own language

349
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.260
that's fine because it's a result of the
self making an assertion of what one is

350
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.039
comfortable with
but I have strong ethical concerns about

351
00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:08.640
living in an apparently politically
correct Society where the class of

352
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.340
reformed oppressors are still dictating
our existence

353
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.200
hold on a minute really let that sink in

354
00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:22.799
this time they are not limiting our
actions but rather and this is worse

355
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:28.140
shaping the way we think about ourselves
and that isn't to dismiss the pain and

356
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.679
suffering that people have gone through
queer has been used as an insult within

357
00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:37.080
lived history yes and your trauma
matters but there is a problem when you

358
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.940
are telling others that they should have
your trauma why do you want more people

359
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.919
to have trauma isn't that the entire
point of gay queer whatever rights

360
00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:51.659
remember when that's gay was an insult
basically someone saying that something

361
00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:55.740
that they didn't like was gay
that's what I grew up with

362
00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.559
gay was the worst word in the world
now when someone says that's gay they

363
00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:05.940
mean
yeah that's pretty gay gay pride and

364
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:11.039
then out comes the I don't understand
why we need new gay representation we

365
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:15.120
have plenty of gay movies from the 90s
and they helped me

366
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.020
so these damn kids complaining about not
having any gay movies just need to watch

367
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.140
in and out yes
in and out

368
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.559
Pinnacle of filmmaking and remains
relevant to Modern queer audiences

369
00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:30.480
around the world
culture defined and then emerges this

370
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.100
kind of toxicity within the queer
Community where all you'll ever need has

371
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.340
already been done
which is a very inspiring message by the

372
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.059
way to automatically snap back in
history to more homophobic and

373
00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:46.500
transphobic decades
identify with queers facing 20 year old

374
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.419
problems and if you're a creator
you're just [ __ ] out of luck might as

375
00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:55.020
well give up everything we need has
already been done feed the machine of

376
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.140
dredging up suffering from the past and
twisting it into something that can fit

377
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.940
in today all the while ignoring members
of our community who today suffer and

378
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:09.240
are underrepresented and who suffer
because they are not represented we lost

379
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.039
an entire generation of queer artists
because of AIDS we don't need to stifle

380
00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:16.940
the Next Generation

381
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.819
[Music]

382
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:25.740
I realize that there's a few
contradictions developing here at the

383
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.880
same time that I'm advocating replacing
one overarching umbrella term LGBT for

384
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.440
another queer I'm also pushing for a
stronger presence in self-identification

385
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.360
how does changing the overarching
descriptive term accomplish that and

386
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.039
furthermore how does it help bolster the
voices of internal communities in a way

387
00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:48.960
that LGBT doesn't already do well for
starters someone will have to make a

388
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.679
conscious decision am I referring to the
whole Community or am I just referring

389
00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:58.559
to a singular group because as a single
word queer refers to a specific idea

390
00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:03.539
whereas LGBT refers to many things
however in practice there is an

391
00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:07.980
encouragement to default to LGBT when
even just one of the given identity

392
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.059
criteria are met speaking to the most
publicly accepted and privileged of us

393
00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:16.500
does not facilitate a presence for the
entire community and especially in idle

394
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.220
conversations when people gloss over the
letters and CIS people are especially

395
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.820
guilty of this it's like they aren't
really aware of what the letters

396
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.140
actually stand for instead they just
vomit out the jumble of sounds because

397
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.020
this is what they've been told they're
supposed to say

398
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.840
and they're going to stick to the script
God damn it but these aren't words

399
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.260
they're letters and letters don't carry
the history of the words that they

400
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.340
represent but if people start using
queer maybe they'll take half a second

401
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.299
to acknowledge to themselves The
Suffering that has been inflicted on the

402
00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:50.039
queer community that is still inflicted
on this community and will continue to

403
00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:55.200
be inflicted for as long as we keep
declaring every narcissistic twink on

404
00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.320
YouTube and Wall Street gay to be a
champion of lgbtqia plus rights

405
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.159
maybe they'll think
maybe I shouldn't call this queer

406
00:30:05.159 --> 00:30:08.880
representation because this does not
represent all queers

407
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.659
it only represents the gays or the
lesbians or the bias or the trans people

408
00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:16.559
or the envies because it's not like
being queer means that lesbian and trans

409
00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:21.960
and non-binary will just vanish in fact
I hope that having a singular term will

410
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.679
help these communities have the ability
to describe their own presence in the

411
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:28.679
world
suddenly Hollywood journalists will

412
00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:33.960
maybe stop saying that a movie has
lgbtqia plus representation when really

413
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.799
there's just a cyclops monster lady like
as far as visible clearly stated

414
00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:42.000
representation goes that's just L
representation and that's fine that's

415
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.539
that's more than fine that's great
lesbian representation but having a

416
00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:49.200
cyclops lesbian in a movie does not
qualify for representing trans people

417
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.399
and saying that a movie has lgbtqia plus
representation when it's only

418
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:57.720
representing one letter is bad
I want media to be clear and distinct

419
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.960
about what identities are being
presented

420
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.940
don't give a Studio lgbtqia Plus Credit
points for having a lesbian sister

421
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.240
character or a gay best friend and
that's it

422
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.640
not all lgbtqia plus people get equal
time in the spotlight

423
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.899
let's talk about media actually since
that's kind of my wheelhouse two TV

424
00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:22.860
shows that both are described as having
lgbtqia plus representation Queer as

425
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.880
Folk and Shameless
Queer as Folk is a show about a group of

426
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.539
gay and lesbian friends in turn of the
Millennium Pittsburgh and focuses mainly

427
00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:34.740
on a whole host of queer issues
including gay bashing same-sex marriage

428
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.940
monogamy drugs and addiction
relationships between HIV positive and

429
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.620
negative people coming out porn
surrogacy family Dynamics and dealing

430
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.179
with anti-gay politicians
Shameless on the other hand is a show

431
00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:52.500
about an impoverished family in Chicago
trying to get by as the city gentrifies

432
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.159
and their flawed upbringings lead them
down paths that destroy opportunities

433
00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:00.840
for Education career advancement and
emotional stability which one sounds

434
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.039
more lgbtqia plus inclusive if you
haven't watched them you might be

435
00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:08.460
surprised to find out that it's not the
one about gay people

436
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.419
queers folk focuses almost entirely on
gays and lesbians with a hint of

437
00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:15.539
bisexuality around the edges and that's
it

438
00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:21.419
one of my favorite shows of all time but
it's very LGB focused which isn't a bad

439
00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:26.880
thing but we can't really say it's an
lgbtqia Plus show while Shameless which

440
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.960
is ostensibly a straight show about
poverty actually is far more inclusive

441
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.940
of the lgbtqia spectrum we've got queer
characters like Monica the never around

442
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.380
mom of the family who's pansexual Ian
her gay son who actually had his own

443
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.100
vomiting scene after being forced to
have sex with a woman a nice Twist on a

444
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.059
very tired trope
Mickey Ian's OTP who is also gay in a

445
00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:51.960
bossy bottom but who gets married to a
woman at one point in the series The

446
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.799
Woman being Svetlana a bisexual Russian
who ends up in a three-way relationship

447
00:32:55.799 --> 00:33:00.179
with another by character V and her
husband Kev Ian's sister Debbie is

448
00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:04.200
eventually bisexual with multiple
girlfriends and Ian dates trans man

449
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.100
Trevor for a while who was probably the
most down-to-earth and stable character

450
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.480
to appear on the show and they're just
the characters with major story arcs

451
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.820
there's a lot more so the straight show
actually has far more lgbtqia plus

452
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:23.760
representation than the show with queer
in the title and yet the objective of

453
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.779
Queer as Folk
is to discuss issues and elements of the

454
00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:31.559
queer Community as a whole
perhaps not as inclusive as it could

455
00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:36.120
have or should have been but it speaks
more to a queer state of being even as

456
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.279
Shameless has it beat for quantifiable
representation check boxes which is what

457
00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:48.240
my hope for the word queer would be
LGBT is a term which basically functions

458
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.860
as a checklist a head count but it's
really hard to qualify an overarching

459
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.440
culture of shared values it's hard to
talk about lgbtqia plus culture because

460
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.340
it refers to the political and
sociological status of the group of

461
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:07.019
people it represents queer has greater
flexibility in describing not only the

462
00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:11.040
collection of these people but also
referring to the collective and shared

463
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.780
culture between them
at the same time the syntax itself makes

464
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.280
it less appropriate to refer to queer
representation when speaking to

465
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.480
representation of individual internal
communities would be more proper plus

466
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.139
making it a word that has been formerly
used as a slur

467
00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:32.820
may make the straight second guess just
using it by default

468
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.980
so when there's lesbian representation
without trans representation they'll say

469
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.399
lesbian representation instead of giving
a studio or network a pat on the back

470
00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:46.370
for diversity they didn't earn

[Applause]
[Music]

472
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:55.679
but at the end of the day we really need
to start to unify and recognize the

473
00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:00.480
individual needs within various groups
in the community and while that may seem

474
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.040
to be contradictory I don't think we
specifically the more privileged

475
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.780
elements within the community can really
address those needs without coming

476
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:15.420
together yes we are divided in our
identities but that doesn't mean we need

477
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:20.280
to be divided in our common objectives
the whole I've got mine it's up to you

478
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.560
to get yours has never been in season
and frankly it's a bad look on anyone

479
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:31.020
let's be honest anything and everything
can be used or misused as an insult

480
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.140
against us
you think it's a mental slip that Boomer

481
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:40.380
politicians say transgender to people
why do we condemn words so deeply while

482
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.460
ignoring the intention laid behind them
if you say fact while talking about how

483
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.900
much you love your tragically gay best
friend group you're homophobic but if

484
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.619
you pass harmful or dismissive
legislation while describing these

485
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:57.420
people as the LGBT community you're
doing great focusing on language and

486
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.880
politically correct language makes it so
easy for people to persecute us and

487
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.500
Escape consequences because technically
they're saying the right things if

488
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.240
that's all we care about using the right
language then we're just gonna let the

489
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.020
rest of society walk all over us we
already let ourselves get tone policed

490
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.740
every time one of us gets angry at
something that we should be angry about

491
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:25.880
the sish head folks cross their arms and
say well that's not how you make friends

492
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.020
you need to focus on getting people on
your side which

493
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.880
sure but at the same time
we would rather just be treated like

494
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.320
human beings without having to jump
through hoops while our allies hold our

495
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.460
rights hostage for our good behavior if
we take every word that has ever been

496
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.900
used against us and tell ourselves that
we can't say it we're going to become

497
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.780
very illiterate very quickly but we also
possess the transformative power of

498
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.640
looking at something hateful and taking
it away from our haters by removing

499
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.920
their language of hate we remove their
power over us at least some of it it

500
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.300
doesn't stop there granted they still
have legal protections to hate us but we

501
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.320
can take away their ability to force us
to react to their hate we're here we're

502
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.640
queer and by slinging insults at us
they're only demonstrating that they're

503
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.280
choosing not to ignore us which
a bunch of grown ass Christian men

504
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.960
obsessing over half-naked muscle Queens
grinding on each other on a pride float

505
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.000
that's kind of gay the straighter option
would just be to not think about it

506
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.599
try it
I know it's hard and if you don't want

507
00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:40.859
to identify as queer that's fine I can't
make you do anything unless you're into

508
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:45.960
that but I can say that the future does
not belong to us we can only push it in

509
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.320
the direction that we like and see what
sticks with young people

510
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.780
but what's the point in having Pride if
we're not proud to be different

511
00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:01.020
to be outside the normal to be queer
if we're ashamed of being queer of being

512
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:08.099
different then isn't this a fundamental
failure of Pride on a basic level I mean

513
00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:12.000
why would you want to be proud of being
like everyone else

514
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.040
congratulations you can function on a
base level of boringness established by

515
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.040
generations of restrictive social
conditioning hooray assimilation

516
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.140
successful
so in closing

517
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.300
as the emotional music swells

518
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.540
I'm not here to make you cry today just
don't be basic

519
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.140
be clear
