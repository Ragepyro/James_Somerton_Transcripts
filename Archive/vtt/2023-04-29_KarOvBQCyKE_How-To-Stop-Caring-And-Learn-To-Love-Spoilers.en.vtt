00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.580
The Last of Us TV show on HBO was one of
the most anticipated TV shows of recent

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.080
years based on the hit video game of the
same name The Last of Us follows the

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.300
story of Joel and Ellie two survivors in
a post-apocalyptic World ravaged by a

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
deadly fungal infection
the show garnered a lot of attention for

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
its high production values talented cast
and faithful adaptation of the game's

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
story however one of the most
significant aspects of the show is its

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
representation of queer characters one
of the most prominent gay characters in

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.280
The Last of Us is Bill in the game bill
is a loner and an expert in surviving in

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.260
this infected World however his past is
revealed to the player through notes and

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.520
diary entries scattered throughout the
game where it is revealed that he had a

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
partner named Frank
who was infected Bill's story is tragic

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.579
and his portrayal in the game is
sympathetic and nuanced avoiding the

14
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.420
common stereotypes the queer characters
are often subjected to the TV show

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.500
expands on his character's backstory in
episode 3 we see the full story of Bill

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.119
and Frank their relationship is depicted
in a heartfelt and authentic manner a

17
00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.540
long lasting relationship between two
men who create a sort of paradise for

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.080
themselves in the middle of the horrors
of the infected world the show also

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.159
explores the trauma that bill
experiences as a result of the idea of

20
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
losing Frank because in this apocalyptic
world neither of them could imagine

21
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.920
living without the other but Bill and
Frank are only in one episode a mostly

22
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.840
self-contained episode that particularly
homophobic viewers could skip over

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.780
without missing out much but with Ellie
they have no such luxury Ellie is really

24
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.979
the main protagonist of the show she's
not only a well-rounded character with

25
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
complex motivations and storylines but
she's also a representation of queer

26
00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
youth that has been rarely seen in
mainstream media the representation of

27
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.040
Ellie as a queer character in the show
is important because it may help to

28
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.960
normalize queer identities and create a
sense of sympathy and understanding for

29
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.740
queer people among the straight audience
but unlike many queer characters in

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.860
media Ellie's sexuality is not a
defining characteristic of her

31
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
personality but rather just one aspect
of her identity it is not used as a plot

32
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.140
device or a means to further the story
in a negative way instead her tragically

33
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.620
short relationship with Riley is
portrayed as a natural and beautiful

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.720
part of her life and unlike Bill and
Frank whose episode can be skipped over

35
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.980
Ellie's queerness isn't going anywhere
and will only become a more prominent

36
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
aspect of the ongoing story in the
second season when she's with Dina by

37
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
centering the only real romantic
relationships in the show around Bill

38
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.800
and Frank and Ellie and Riley the show
is pushing back against the idea that

39
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.599
heterosexuality is the only acceptable
form of romantic love so why was I so

40
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.879
annoyed by the online discourse around
the show and I don't mean the get woke

41
00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.780
go broke crowd who were Furious that the
show's ratings just kept getting better

42
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.620
and better every week even as it got
gayer and gayer I'm talking about the

43
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.840
people who complained incessantly every
week about spoilers as a gay I've never

44
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.140
much cared for spoilers especially when
it comes to Media about gay people

45
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.920
because there's only one of two possible
endings they live happily ever after or

46
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.580
at least one of them dies not much to
spoil there but the privilege of being

47
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.780
able to have more than two ending
options sure has seeped into the minds

48
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.040
of an awful lot of the mass audience
creating a fungal hive mind chanting no

49
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.599
spoilers no spoilers no spoilers no
spoilers so let's talk about some

50
00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.319
spoilers but first how about some
self-promotion and a word from this

the language of spoilers is a relatively

73
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.680
new term though it has roots in
Hollywood culture famously The Simpsons

74
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.400
once depicted a flashback to 1980 with
Homer and Marge leaving a screening of

75
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.460
The Empire Strikes Back while beside a
line of people going into the theater

76
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.479
Homer blunderously remarks wow what an
ending Huda thought Darth Vader was Luke

77
00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.560
Skywalker's father oh spoiler alert by
the way Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's

78
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.819
father and while surely that experience
is annoying the main distinction of this

79
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:32.039
spoiler is that at no given moment were
you ever expecting there to be a Twist

80
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.919
in the plot this seemingly
straightforward narrative about a Plucky

81
00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.819
Farm Boy becoming a space Knight is
flipped on its head Luke Skywalker's

82
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.300
innocent moral values are suddenly
brought into question when the audience

83
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.600
realizes that he is actually derived
from the story's symbol of evil

84
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.259
specifically when it comes to making
Darth Vader Luke's father George Lucas

85
00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.639
spent a great deal of time struggling
with not just how to pull this off but

86
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.360
also whether or not he should these
movies were not explicitly made for

87
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.900
children but he deliberately won wanted
them to be accessible to all ages he

88
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.039
worried that if Darth Vader was Luke's
father the children would find that too

89
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.419
frightening but he did want shock factor
to be a huge part of the reveal make no

90
00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.500
mistake shock value is a viable literary
tool this was a period of time where

91
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.600
movie trailers in the 1970s would more
or less synopsicize the whole damn movie

92
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.300
first of all the movie script for Empire
Strikes Back did not read that Darth

93
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.020
Vader was Luke's father the only people
who knew the truth were Lucas himself

94
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.259
and director of incursioner almost
immediately before shooting the scene

95
00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.800
kirschner pulled Mark Hamill aside and
told him what the script was actually

96
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.060
going to say meanwhile everyone else on
set thought that Hamill was just really

97
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.039
chewing the scenery when he was reacting
to finding out that per the script

98
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.680
Obi-Wan killed his father that's not
true

99
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.479
it seems that this degree of secret
keeping is the only real thing Disney

100
00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:58.259
learned from Lucas's rule book on
building a franchise Empire the Star

101
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:02.400
Wars franchise in part due to episode
5's Mass cultural shift and what we

102
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.080
could expect out of a Blockbuster movie
has become obsessively rooted in

103
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.479
withholding information from an audience
that now expects to be surprised which

104
00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:16.800
even by episode 7 it was at a point of
ridiculousness Anthony Daniels who

105
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.699
portrays C-3PO in the series remarked
that he had never been on a movie set

106
00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:24.240
with that much secrecy this is an actor
who had been one of the franchise's

107
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.860
first fans who saw illustrations of his
character and instantly fell in love and

108
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.000
yet even he could not be trusted with
the full script as per the structure of

109
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.020
these trilogies there was a lot riding
on Star Wars episode 8 where everybody

110
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.940
was expecting there to be a Twist Rey is
Luke's daughter or Obi-Wan's

111
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.839
granddaughter or a clone of Padme or
related to one of the other petite

112
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.380
brunette women in the franchise snoke
was a clone of the Emperor or Darth

113
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.240
Plagueis him himself Emperor Palpatine's
Sith Master but the twist here is that

114
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.019
there is no twist meanwhile a huge chunk
of the fan base gets pissed off because

115
00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:01.320
it's not the twist that they were
expecting do you want to be shocked by a

116
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.640
Twist or not spoiler alert by the way
Rey doesn't have special parents except

117
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.760
then it got retconned that she did
because JJ Abrams doesn't know how to

118
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.000
write engaging characters in drama so he
substitutes for an arbitrary sense of

119
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.540
mystery but we'll get to that in a
moment yet this hype around spoilers

120
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.899
that followed every new installation of
the Star Wars franchise since the Disney

121
00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:23.399
acquisition was not present during the
prequels in part I assume because they

122
00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:28.440
were prequels and everyone more or less
knew how they would end Lucas was also

123
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.700
doing very little to try and conceal
that Chancellor Palpatine was Darth

124
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.440
Sidious who would become the emperor Ian
McDermott was credited just the same as

125
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.800
he was in episode 6. Lucas wasn't
hinging the entire prequel trilogy

126
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.100
around making the audience speculate who
the emperor was he wanted you to know

127
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.060
what was going on so you could spot his
methods of manipulation on the

128
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.380
characters who were unaware of what what
his plan was which nobody really gives

129
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.620
the credit to McDermott for carrying the
prequels on his back the way he did in

130
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:01.380
episode 3 we go from Happy helpful
politician to I am the senate in no more

131
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.320
than 10 minutes and somehow it's
completely believable that turning point

132
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.220
in the narration wouldn't have been
possible if Lucas spent the prior four

133
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.000
hours of screen time trying to conceal
who the emperor really was from the

134
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.959
audience this is a case study on why
dramatic irony is still a very relevant

135
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.320
method of building tension because you
don't spend those first two movies

136
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.459
looking for a Twist you get to have a
sense of dredge whenever Palpatine is on

137
00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:28.560
screen you're watching the movie instead
of expecting a shock to happen however

138
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.640
the specific phrasing of spoiler wasn't
present for Darth Vader's Infamous

139
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.120
confession and Empire Strikes Back at
least not in a broadly applicable sense

140
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.240
of cultural awareness and it would have
been much easier to keep away from

141
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.839
spoilers in a world before social media
as a matter of fact the first time that

142
00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:48.360
no spoilers garnished a strong cultural
hold was not for a movie it was for a

143
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.899
book
one of her books

144
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.680
because everything comes back to her
these days this is all her fault spoiler

145
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.459
alert Snape kills Dumbledore now I don't
really have anything to say about her

146
00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.720
anymore and I don't want to start a
discourse on her either so I'm not even

147
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.320
gonna put this in the SEO of the video
but for reasons that can only really be

148
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.500
known through a comprehensive historical
understanding of our culture in the late

149
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.420
90s and early 2000s the Harry Potter
series permeated so deeply that it was

150
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.620
an anomaly in publishing that had never
been seen before even before they were

151
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.500
adapted into movies by the time the
sixth book in the franchise the

152
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.279
Half-Blood Prince was leading up to
release the hype was at an unprecedented

153
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:30.420
level and for those who can read a 500
page book in a matter of hours

154
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.620
like my online boyfriend at the time
fans took to the internet immediately to

155
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.700
find other people to discuss the whole
plot with others who can read that fast

156
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.420
in the process they spoiled one of the
most important narrative redirections in

157
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.899
the entire series when the primary
figure of mentorship is murdered by one

158
00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:49.200
of the longest-running personal
antagonists to the principal protagonist

159
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.560
and by all means doing this was a bit of
a dick move and by all means perhaps

160
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.920
readers should have been a little more
sensitive to those who cannot read so

161
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.640
fast or who cannot for whatever reason
purchase a hardcover book when

162
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.000
pre-orders exceeded the number of
printed copies upon release however

163
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.320
rather than opening a discussion about
when does a new thing stop being new or

164
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.339
where do we create safe spaces to talk
about these new things the word very

165
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.880
quickly became
don't talk about it at all because while

166
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.480
the murder of Dumbledore might not be
the first spoiler it seems to be the

167
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.440
Catalyst for what has become known as
spoiler culture now Snape killing

168
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.579
Dumbledore isn't a bad narrative
decision a good story always has

169
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.360
something to shake up the status quo but
the Legacy around this particular

170
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.740
spoiler quickly became a bit of a joke
in itself regardless of the fact that

171
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.279
there were any number of other mysteries
in the book namely who was the

172
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.240
Half-Blood Prince spoiler alert it was
Snape whether you were at the time a fan

173
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.500
of Harry Potter or not within the fandom
it was as if this detail was the

174
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.279
singular quality of the story that
mattered as if learning this information

175
00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:53.880
outside of experiencing it for yourself
while reading it rendered the entire

176
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.200
plot pointless does it really invalidate
the entire story though since then

177
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.120
spoiler culture has pushed us into this
kind of fervent tight-lipped secrecy how

178
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.260
do we enjoy media if the purpose is to
just consume it as fast as possible to

179
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.519
avoid spoilers where audiences refuse to
engage in any discussion about media for

180
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:15.300
fear of having it spoiled conversely
what if audiences sole method of

181
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.720
engaging with media is to speculate
about what may happen I bet it's

182
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.440
Mephisto what happens to the rest of the
filmmaking process if a project is

183
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.399
exclusively constructed around the
media's ability to generate hype around

184
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:31.380
secrets and twists how can we discuss a
fandom's desire for early birds wanting

185
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.060
to discuss and analyze their media with
others who have not yet seen this media

186
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.620
wanting that same engagement but without
wanting spoilers what about media for

187
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.880
which there's nothing really to spoil
but audiences still act like Minor

188
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.060
Details of a story are spoilers that
ruin everything we've got people

189
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.220
complaining about spoilers for Dune and
Lord of the Rings and any other range of

190
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.000
movies or books that have been available
for public consumption for decades

191
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.139
what's next complaining about spoiling
that Odysseus reconnects with Penelope

192
00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:05.100
spoiler alert in some versions of the
myth he kills her does this mean there's

193
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.579
no point in reading the Odyssey
classical birds and writers used to

194
00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:13.320
include a prologue to their work that
explicitly stated what happens at the

195
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.180
end of the story and yet they crafted
stories so renowned that they outlasted

196
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.040
regimes kingdoms Empires and entire
civilizations having a shift in

197
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.959
narrative Direction seems to be a staple
of media my issue is with spoilers not

198
00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:32.639
with twists or turning points it used to
be that a spoiler referred to the act of

199
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:36.500
sharing information in a story that is
better left being experienced firsthand

200
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.600
now it seems that spoilers refers to
elements of the story itself which

201
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.120
provided a broad enough definition could
be nearly anything about a movie spoiler

202
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.839
alert turns out that Dr Hannibal Lecter
is actually a Serial killing cannibal

203
00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:56.100
spoiler alert the Titanic sinks spoiler
alert Wednesday has a dance scene this

204
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.600
is setting a very restrictive culture
for people who want to publicly engage

205
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.500
with the media they enjoy and I can't
quite tell apart the chicken from the

206
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.660
egg here our audiences suffering such a
weak narrative Constitution that there

207
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.139
is an anaphylactic reaction to any
component of a story that they have not

208
00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:17.100
experienced firsthand yet or is our
climate of corporate generated media

209
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.180
becoming so dependent on formulas of
narrative twists that they have nothing

210
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.320
to offer audiences if they're not
dangling a mystery box over their head

211
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.220
on a string
[Music]

212
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.220
narratively in film there are two
different ways to describe the way that

213
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.740
a story can suddenly change a plot twist
and a turning point people these days

214
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.800
seem to think that they're the same
thing and scream spoilers if you so much

215
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.519
as mentioned the slightest plot
progression a plot twist is an

216
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:51.600
unexpected and dramatic shift in the
storyline that alters the viewers

217
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.220
understanding of the plot it can come in
many forms such as a character's sudden

218
00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.120
betrayal the revelation of a hidden
motive the introduction of a previously

219
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.139
unknown character or the death of a
previously well plot armored character

220
00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:08.040
plot twists can be used to create
suspense challenge the audience's

221
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.560
expectations or provide a surprising
ending when they're done well in

222
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.220
contrast a turning point is a
significant moment in the story that

223
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.480
changes the direction of the narrative
but doesn't change everything about the

224
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.560
movie strictly in literary terms a
turning point is when the character

225
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.920
makes a decision that alters the
direction of the story in a way that

226
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.079
cannot be reversed this is an important
element of dramatic tragedy where a

227
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:37.980
character's direct action prevents this
story from ending on a happy note

228
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.139
spoiler alert Romeo kills tibult while
both plot twists and turning points can

229
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:46.860
be important elements in storytelling
they serve different functions and have

230
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.880
different effects on the audience plot
twists are often used to create a moment

231
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.500
of surprise or shock they can come out
of nowhere and in many cases remove a

232
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.639
lot of the rewatchability value of the
film if the whole movie is built on the

233
00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:03.060
twist why bother watching it again
turning points on the other hand are

234
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.540
almost always necessary to advance the
plot and change the direction of the

235
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.140
story when needed another key difference
between plot twists and turning points

236
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.520
is the timing of their occurrence plot
twists usually occur towards the end of

237
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.720
the story often at the climax or
resolution and are designed to shock the

238
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.079
audience and hopefully have them leaving
the cinema talking about it there's an

239
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.500
old adage in filmmaking the quality of
the movie doesn't matter only the

240
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.460
quality of the last 15 minutes because
that's what people will remember turning

241
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.700
points on the other hand can occur at
any time in the story and are used to

242
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.419
create momentum and tension more often
than not they occur within the first

243
00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:40.740
half of the movie for instance spoiler
alert the shooting of Vito Corleone is a

244
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.580
pivotal moment in Francis Ford Coppola's
Masterpiece The Godfather the scene

245
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.360
takes place pretty early on in the film
and sets the stage for the rest of the

246
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.080
story the shooting itself is abrupt and
shocking it's a turning point for the

247
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.440
characters because it marks a shift in
power dynamics within the Corleone

248
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.760
family Vito is the head of the family
and has always been in charge however

249
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.380
after he is shot and left critically
injured his eldest son Sunny steps up to

250
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.640
take control this leads to a bit of a
power struggle between sunny and Vito's

251
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.960
youngest son Michael who is at first
first reluctant to get involved in the

252
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.200
family business Sunny's aggressive
leadership style though leads to a war

253
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.340
with rival families that eventually
leads to him being killed Michael's

254
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.940
eventual takeover of the family having
all of his enemies assassinated on the

255
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.960
day of his baby's christening sets him
on a path of corruption and violence

256
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.460
that we follow throughout the Godfather
Part 2 and part three I've seen way too

257
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.480
many people online complain about having
the Godfather spoiled for them when the

258
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.620
movie's quality has absolutely nothing
to do with turning points in the film

259
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.160
there's a reason this film is held up as
one of the quintessential masterpieces

260
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.200
of Cinema there's far more to watch it
for than just surprises contrast that

261
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.160
with the 2012 horror movie Cabin in the
Woods the film sets up the classic

262
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.220
horror movie tropes of a group of
college students heading out to a remote

263
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.240
Cabin in the Woods for a weekend of fun
only to encounter a mysterious and

264
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.840
terrifying force waiting for them
however spoiler alert the entire

265
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.960
scenario has been staged by a group of
technicians working for a mysterious

266
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.400
organization the horror is not real but
rather a simulated experience design to

267
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.480
appease ancient gods while this twist is
a clever subversion of horror movie

268
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.100
conventions it's such a 180
that there's not much you get out of it

269
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.640
watching it a second time the first half
of the movie is a straightforward horror

270
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.240
film with a suspenseful atmosphere of
fun dialogue more character development

271
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.559
for the ones who usually get killed off
first and a strong sense of dread the

272
00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:36.120
office workers leave the audience
wondering what's going on but they

273
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.419
aren't that distracting from the
deliberately paint by numbers plot

274
00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:42.840
however once the twist is revealed the
tone of the film becomes a much more

275
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.220
comedic meta commentary about horror
movies in general while the shift can be

276
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.700
entertaining it also means that the
audience is no longer invested in the

277
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.880
horrific elements of the film or the
characters it had been setting up the

278
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.660
sense of dread is replaced by a sense of
Detachment knowing the ending when you

279
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.799
watch The Godfather does not ruin the
experience of watching The Godfather but

280
00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:07.020
knowing the ending of Cabin in the Woods
why even bother watching it now plot

281
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.039
twists aren't evil a well-executed plot
twist can keep the audience guessing and

282
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:14.340
on the edge of their seats this is
because it creates uncertainty about the

283
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.240
outcome of the story which creates a
sense of anticipation and excitement

284
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.960
certainly there are many movies with
plot twists that are absolutely worth

285
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.100
re-watching we need to keep in mind that
it's the twist that becomes spoiled the

286
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.840
twist is not the spoiler however the
issue is when a spoiled twist spoils the

287
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.620
whole movie it can detract from the
overall experience of the story and

288
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.679
leave the audience feeling disappointed
or cheated what's the point of an

289
00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:41.700
audience getting emotionally invested in
a story if they are made aware of the

290
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.780
only worthwhile element of that story
another problem comes if the twist

291
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.559
undermines the logic or consistency of
the world if the twist contradicts

292
00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:53.760
established facts or character traits it
feels contrived and leaves the audience

293
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.780
feeling unsatisfied for example if a
character is actually another character

294
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.140
who the fans have already guessed is
that character but whom the filmmakers

295
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.260
swear up and down is not that character
spoiler alert my name

296
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:14.100
is Kai that's just
lying like some Creator whose only real

297
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.760
creative trick is to establish
mysterious contrivances that keep the

298
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.380
audience guessing and whose panicked
response to audiences figuring it out is

299
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.340
to insist that they're wrong in order to
give them a reason to buy a ticket so

300
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.380
when does a spoiler not spoil a movie I
used the example from The Empire Strikes

301
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.460
Back where the famous twist has reached
the point where most children have heard

302
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.120
the line referenced before they've ever
seen the movie I can't think of many

303
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.500
ways that someone could go into watching
episode 5 completely blind in this day

304
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.039
and age and yet this film is frequently
held up as a science fiction Masterpiece

305
00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:50.640
it should be a demonstration that
knowing what happens in a movie doesn't

306
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.480
mean that the movie itself is spoiled
how does this spoiler continue to

307
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.320
function as a successful twist first of
all nobody was expecting there to be a

308
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.380
Twist in the first place there's so
little of the movie's content that

309
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.919
hinges on the relationship between Darth
Vader and Luke Skywalker even up until

310
00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:08.460
the point where Darth Vader spoils
Luke's parentage we're under the

311
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.960
impression that he wants to capture Luke
to bring him to the emperor the prior

312
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.740
hour and a half is spent embroiled in a
discussion about military operations

313
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.960
against an overwhelming Force poignant
and subversive philosophical debate and

314
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.159
acute political discourse it's difficult
to spoil a movie when the highlights of

315
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:30.539
the story are contained in debate and
conversation Darth Vader's Revelation is

316
00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:34.740
a fantastic five minutes out of another
fantastic two hours what specifically

317
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.679
makes this twist so good is that the
twist is more significant for the

318
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:42.240
characters the characters affected by
the plot are entirely invested with why

319
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.380
this Revelation is so significant either
directly or by proxy not only does the

320
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.700
audience know what emotional effect this
has upon Luke but we also see Darth

321
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.740
Vader now as a human figure rather than
the more machine than man perspective of

322
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.380
him take a look at some of the other
most infamous twists in Hollywood

323
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.159
history such as Alfred Hitchcock's
Psycho spoiler alert Norman Bates

324
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.100
dresses up like his dead mother and
murders people and then blames it on his

325
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.120
mom nearly everybody knows this the
movie had a shot for shot remake in 1998

326
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.500
in a prequel TV series the movie still
remains one of the Masterworks of

327
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.100
cinematic horror and it's not because
you're so shocked when you learn what

328
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.260
happens it's a combination of tension
performance and some of the most iconic

329
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.760
melding of visuals and Orchestra ever
put to film while Norman Bates being the

330
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.960
Killer is certainly a shock it is not
the only twist in the movie audiences of

331
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.640
the day would have even said that it was
a far cry from the primary twist the

332
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.260
character of Marion crane is portrayed
by Janet Lee a close approximation would

333
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.520
be like comparing her to Margot Robbie
today a Hollywood actress at the peak of

334
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.000
the industry and although she is in all
the marketing she's killed 40 minutes

335
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.360
into the movie another reason why the
twist doesn't spoil the movie is that it

336
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.380
adds to the overall atmosphere from the
beginning psycho is a movie that is

337
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.159
designed to make audiences feel uneasy
the black and white cinematography the

338
00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:03.360
Eerie score the unconventional structure
all work together to create a sense of

339
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.020
foreboding the Revelation that Norman
Bates is the killer only adds to this

340
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.679
atmosphere of dread by the time the
twist comes audiences are already on the

341
00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:14.580
edge of their seats and they're ready to
be shocked the fact that mild-mannered

342
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.360
baits is capable of such violence is all
the more horrifying because of the mood

343
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.679
that has been established throughout the
whole film the film spends its duration

344
00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:27.059
earning that unsettling payoff it's a
natural conclusion to the story that is

345
00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:30.539
supported by the events of the film
Hitchcock carefully plants Clues and red

346
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:34.740
herrings throughout the movie leading
audiences down One path before revealing

347
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.100
the truth it's not a mystery for
mystery's sake there are no lingering

348
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.460
questions dangling over the audience's
head in a false belief that this is the

349
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.539
only way to engage the audience
Hitchcock's soft touch invites the

350
00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:49.020
audience into the mystery when the
mystery is solved it means as much to

351
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.340
the audience as it does to the
characters the twist for the sake of a

352
00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:00.480
Twist came about in recent years thanks
to in most part two filmmakers M Night

353
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.280
Shyamalan and JJ Abrams Shyamalan became
famous for his last minute twist in the

354
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.179
sixth sense when the audience discovers
that Bruce Willis was dead the entire

355
00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:13.440
time spoiler alert what's unfortunate is
that M Night Shyamalan got so big off of

356
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.220
this movie that he spent his entire
career trying to recreate that famous

357
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.640
twist that put him on the map though
nunner is renowned for twists as JJ

358
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.380
Abrams and his goddamn Mystery Box the
mystery box is a literal box that Abrams

359
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.039
purchased from a magic shop when he was
a child allegedly it contained various

360
00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:32.700
magic tricks and props but he never
opened it the Box became a symbol for

361
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.380
him of the power of mystery and the
unknown honestly this story sounds just

362
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.220
about as contrived as most of his movies
it's got that kind of feel-good

363
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.840
sensibility that you'd expect to find in
80 Spielberg movies and their CopyCats

364
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.700
in filmmaking the mystery box concept
refers to the use of mystery and

365
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.080
ambiguity to create interest and
suspense in a story even if the writer

366
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.320
doesn't know what the end result will be
Abrams has stated that he believes in

367
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.140
the power of mystery and that
withholding information can create a

368
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.919
sense of anticipation and excitement for
the audience that he's more interested

369
00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:09.419
in questions than answers most
notoriously he used this box I

370
00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:13.080
mean mystery box when he took over the
Star Wars series after Disney bought the

371
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.159
rights for my very depressed George
Lucas in JJ's sequel Trilogy the use of

372
00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:21.179
the mystery box was criticized for being
overused and poorly executed for example

373
00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:25.140
in the force awakens he introduced new
characters like Rey and kylo Ren and

374
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.799
deliberately left as many questions
unanswered about them as possible while

375
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:32.880
this initially created excitement and
speculation among fans it also left many

376
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.020
feeling unsatisfied and frustrated when
those questions were either left

377
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.240
unanswered or answered unsatisfactorily
by the end of the mess known as the rise

378
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.200
of Skywalker by that point many critics
who lauded episode 7 argued that the use

379
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.700
of the mystery box was used as a crutch
to cover up the plot holes or weak

380
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.120
writing rather than being an integral
part of the storytelling the lack of

381
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.659
coherent planning and consistent vision
for the sequel Trilogy also contributed

382
00:26:57.659 --> 00:27:01.260
to the perception that the mystery box
was being overused as a gimmick rather

383
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.000
than as a legitimate storytelling device
and they did absolutely everything they

384
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.679
could to protect their precious twists
and spoilers Han dying wasn't really a

385
00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:13.740
twist for anyone who knows anything
about Harrison Ford's career and his

386
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.520
opinion of Star Wars but it shocked
plenty of people nonetheless the emperor

387
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.299
still being alive was a nonsensical
spoiler that they even used in the

388
00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:25.080
advertising for episode nine but the
fact that Rey was his granddaughter was

389
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.220
kept very close to the chest it screams
that a filmmaker has little faith in

390
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.120
their work that they hinge your
enjoyment of the movie entirely on a

391
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.440
Twist leaving you shocked but what's
left after the shock it didn't take

392
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.919
audiences many repeat visits to the
theater to come to the conclusion that

393
00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:46.980
episode 7 kinda
lacked anything other than Nostalgia on

394
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.299
your first viewing you get the rush of
feelings but rushing emotions give

395
00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:55.260
diminishing returns this is the same
reason why many people who may have at

396
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.159
one point named their pets after
characters from the MCU are now avoiding

397
00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:03.000
anything with that logo on it like the
plague you get to a point where you

398
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.100
think am I actually excited for this
movie or do I just do this out of habit

399
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.720
which leads some people to then question
if I divest from this media am I

400
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.320
actually missing anything that's one
thing for Marvel movies but provided how

401
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.000
staggeringly successful they are
were almost all of Hollywood is doing

402
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.679
everything it can to cash in on that
success by doing the same thing what

403
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:29.340
happens to the quality of our media when
the largest media producers are only

404
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.679
gauging the quality of media on whether
there's something they can conceal

405
00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:41.220
from their paying audience
[Music]

406
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.000
some people are just naturally good at
picking up on hints and cues in either a

407
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.840
movie itself or indications within the
ads if our entire cinematic creative

408
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.500
process is constructed around creating
surprises for the audience then there

409
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.100
isn't going to be a whole lot of ways
for them to connect with say a Marvel

410
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.700
movie I've seen a relatively recent
shift where many people have simply

411
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.960
stopped engaging with movies and may
avoid movies with straightforward plots

412
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.900
because they feel that there's no point
in watching them if there's no twist

413
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.200
never mind when it comes to say movies
like everything everywhere all at once

414
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.460
or the menu or even Dungeons and Dragons
there's nothing really to spoil even

415
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.600
take a look at Mega successful smashes
like Avatar 2 and the Super Mario

416
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.919
Brothers movie there's no Grand
Revelations here one is a Showcase of

417
00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:26.820
CGI spectacle and the other is a love
letter to a beloved video game franchise

418
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.539
that was done dirty in the early 90s as
far as spoilers go any surprises about

419
00:29:30.539 --> 00:29:34.320
these movies or either things you cannot
really describe spoiler alert hot dog

420
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.039
fingers or our turning points that occur
within the first third of the movie with

421
00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:42.299
each of these examples the reason you're
meant to watch it is to watch it in fact

422
00:29:42.299 --> 00:29:45.480
one of the most surprising things to me
about the menu and maybe this is because

423
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.320
of my obsession with Hannibal is that
the movie isn't about fine dining

424
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.580
cannibalism spoiler alert it's
not about

425
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:58.200
fine dining cannibalism
the real spoilers for that movie are

426
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.620
about the themes and Concepts that drive
the plot because the way that film

427
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.399
expresses those ideas are so detailed
and nuanced that they cannot be

428
00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:09.419
expressed in any singular instance
without context and in fact even if I

429
00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:13.080
read you a synopsis of the movie I'd
still tell you to go see it because

430
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.120
there's just so much about it that can't
be put into words like they say the

431
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.580
living is in the journey not the
destination

432
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.299
which
I would really like to see a return to

433
00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:27.899
that sensibility because I'm starting to
see this process of generating hype

434
00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:32.520
around secrecy as a contributing factor
to an overall dip in quality in media in

435
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.440
general namely in Disney but Disney owns
half Hollywood by now so even just a

436
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.340
decline in that corporation's output is
a substantial chunk and the corner

437
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.940
cutting is tempting why do you need to
put your best foot forward when you can

438
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.899
get Butts into theater seats by
promising a grand twist that you must

439
00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:53.460
see this movie to experience especially
if you need to see this twist in order

440
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.179
to have any hope of understanding what's
going to happen in future projects it's

441
00:30:57.179 --> 00:31:01.500
the interconnected Universe declining
quality pipeline this isn't even

442
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.799
something connected exclusively to
superhero movies or other specific genre

443
00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:08.220
Blockbusters the Batman was a murder
mystery built around the question of who

444
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.000
is the Riddler spoiler alert it was Paul
Dano he was on the Press tour the

445
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
surprising parts of the movie were the
performances from Pattinson and Kravitz

446
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.840
If This Were a Disney project or
anything directed by JJ Abrams I can

447
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.820
definitely see it not being out of the
question for them to keep Dano hidden

448
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.360
inside of a locked trunk between the
last day of filming and the premiere and

449
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.899
based on some of his interviews he might
even be into that if the executives on a

450
00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:35.159
project believe that there is nothing
more to this media Beyond how it can

451
00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:38.640
shock and surprise an audience why do
they need to spend a buck on anything

452
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.120
else quantumania certainly took a
critical hit for just not paying

453
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.419
attention to visuals in recent memory
most of Disney's new projects are shot

454
00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:49.559
on special projection screens to make
sure no spoilers get leaked however

455
00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:54.600
actors can't interact with the set and
there's so much light being projected

456
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.480
that it's a nightmare for
cinematographers and it just looks bad

457
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.899
and while we may accept that there is an
entire collection of films whose

458
00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:04.440
executive oversight does not believe
that they have anything to offer but 200

459
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.419
million dollar surprises unfortunately
this bleeds out into other movies some

460
00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:12.960
as I mentioned do not really have
anything to spoil in the first place but

461
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.340
people still may act like they do but
others as I mentioned are based on

462
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.179
existing media that has been publicly
available for some time I'm sorry but

463
00:32:21.179 --> 00:32:25.200
Dune has been absent the 60s if you care
enough about the property it shouldn't

464
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.440
be a surprise to you that Paul ends up
starting a holy war and is kind of

465
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.000
depicted as a massive jerk no not
spoiler alert if it matters that much to

466
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.720
you read the damn book because people
who have read it are going to want to

467
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.740
talk about it the whole universe isn't
going to set classic movies and books on

468
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.340
the shelf and wait for you to have time
to get around to it because other people

469
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:48.240
have there are three ways to avoid
spoilers you can keep away from online

470
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.200
spaces until you've consumed the media
you want or you can selectively choose

471
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.460
to engage with media which is not
constructed around spoilers or you can

472
00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.299
accept spoilers and continue to engage
with media anyway unfortunately there is

473
00:33:00.299 --> 00:33:04.080
no real way to avoid spoilers while
existing in online spaces there's always

474
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.799
going to be some jerk who somehow found
a leaked script for a new episode of a

475
00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:11.100
Star Wars streaming series and blabbers
about it on Twitter while there is some

476
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.240
responsibility for people to not leak
any plot twists in a movie other people

477
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.659
really can't be held accountable for
your emotional reaction to spoiled

478
00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:21.779
content and on the flip side there needs
to be a greater effort on the creative

479
00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:25.260
side to generate content for which
spoilers are irrelevant and no you don't

480
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.740
need to make a simple straightforward
movie to really do that in recent memory

481
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.919
knives out and its sequel Glass Onion
demonstrate that you can make an

482
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:35.820
engaging murder mystery where it's
abundantly clear who the Killer is from

483
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.360
the very beginning but even if you call
the shots that who's the murderer part

484
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.659
of it isn't the reason why you're meant
to be watching these movies are about

485
00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:46.799
rich people being horrible people the
mystery is just a vessel for that even

486
00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:50.880
the mystery box the idea of deliberately
holding a mystery over the audience's

487
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.140
head isn't an inherently tainted
narrative trick if you know how to make

488
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.919
a good movie you can pull it off one of
the quintessentially great movies of all

489
00:33:58.919 --> 00:34:04.799
time has a mystery box the whole point
of Citizen Kane is what is rosebud the

490
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:08.639
final word of the titular Charles Foster
Kane it takes the entire movie to figure

491
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.599
out what it is and in fact these days
most people know what Rosebud is before

492
00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:16.200
they even see the movie spoiler alert
it's his childhood sled and if you think

493
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.960
for a second that that spoils the movie
and therefore there's no point in

494
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.339
watching it then quite frankly it's your
loss but knowing this doesn't speak to

495
00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:27.060
the reasons why this film is held up as
an Exemplar of excellence in cinema

496
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.260
knowing the name of the sled doesn't
answer the question why should I watch

497
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.339
this movie it's a movie about innocence
a fall from grace and the corruptive

498
00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:39.659
power of success the sled has nothing to
do with it and everything to do with it

499
00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:45.419
and you don't know how that's possible
unless you watch the whole movie there

500
00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:50.159
is an onus on audiences to not put
twists and plot beats on a pedestal of

501
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:54.960
importance to such a degree that they
let these things spoil a movie if these

502
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.260
things spoil a movie then watching the
movie itself spoils the movie you know

503
00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.220
what happens doesn't that spoil it for
the second time you watch it why not use

504
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.359
the power of your dollar to support
media that can't be spoiled by a leaked

505
00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:10.680
script hopefully this will put pressure
on Hollywood to begin putting some oomph

506
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.940
back into their narrative impact and
other aspects of the creative process

507
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:20.280
Dungeons and Dragons shows us that not
having a spoilable Twist doesn't spell

508
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.540
the end of the Blockbuster you can make
fun engaging movies without the

509
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.460
diminishing returns of a surprise twist
even if you all didn't go see it yes I'm

510
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.760
judging you as much as the primary
responsibility should be put on the

511
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.940
corporate production side of Hollywood
to provide us with the kind of quality

512
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.200
that you'd think would be in demand for
the cost of a movie ticket these days

513
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.400
this is a slow moving beast and we are
the ones who have to mobilize and begin

514
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.079
to ask for more
and sometimes I think we forget that we

515
00:35:49.079 --> 00:35:55.920
do have that power
[Music]

516
00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.440
it's amazing that people alive today get
to say that we're living through a

517
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.300
golden age for us it seems we're living
in the Golden Age of Television commonly

518
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.859
credited to have begun with Breaking Bad
television and streaming services

519
00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:14.940
especially experienced an unprecedented
creative expansion

520
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.079
of the kinds of content that could be
put on the small screen and in many ways

521
00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:22.740
the big screen was given a run for its
money through not only content but also

522
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.060
the use of newly available high
definition and 4K cameras to introduce

523
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.740
cinematic lighting and dynamic range to
TV from Breaking Bad We got Hannibal

524
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.760
from Hannibal we've now got Interview
with a Vampire who needs Oscar base

525
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.140
nothing exemplified this quite like Game
of Thrones the HBO series adapted from

526
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.220
George RR Martin's game-changing Song of
Ice and Fire book series and nothing

527
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.960
else has ever exemplified just how far a
once in a lifetime television phenomenon

528
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.740
can go out of its way to almost
completely tarnish its reputation

529
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.160
forever and it's because of spoiler
culture when the showrunners ran out of

530
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.119
the source material because Martin takes
so long to write some fans noticed a

531
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:04.800
marked decrease in writing quality the
pacing picked up too fast the methodical

532
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.099
development was replaced with fan
service payoffs granted many also

533
00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:12.119
thought that at this point they'd earned
some of that but I don't the problem for

534
00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:15.300
everyone else came when it seemed like
fans were beginning to predict how how

535
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.960
the series was going to end up until
then the showrunners had enjoyed a

536
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.740
strong reputation for presenting the
unexpected the book series was famous

537
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.820
for killing off characters who seemingly
should have had plot armor and for

538
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.300
shocking political plots that completely
upset what seemed to be a plot

539
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.900
projection spoiler alert lots of people
die don't get attached but sometimes

540
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.960
they do get resurrected so when fans of
the series began to connect the dots

541
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.560
between certain characters who did end
up having a kind of plot armor it's like

542
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.579
the showrunners didn't know how to
generate tension anymore their solution

543
00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:48.300
just flip the script whenever someone
figured it out I don't know why they

544
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.960
thought this was a solid plan because
fan theories about the books were going

545
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.260
to inevitably bleed over into the
discourse of the series so certain

546
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.339
things were rushed perhaps these events
were meant to happen but didn't happen

547
00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:03.839
the way they should have and it ended up
being that the only real twist was

548
00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:08.280
twisting the plot's arm to guarantee
that expectations would be subverted

549
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.200
rather than being ambivalent to an
expectation and just making good art as

550
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.980
I said for years fans had predicted the
end of Martin's books and he knew it

551
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.480
some of them he claims are a dead match
for his outlines but his response to

552
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.260
that was that he wasn't going to change
his plans because some people had

553
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.920
figured them out Game of Thrones should
be a case study in how something so

554
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.359
culturally lauded can go awry if the
sole purpose is to surprise people and

555
00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:37.619
in the end it certainly was surprisingly
bad because I feel they thought so

556
00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:43.920
little of Their audience that they
expected everyone would be satisfied and

557
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.240
overjoyed Aid
as long as there were twists

558
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.579
a quantity of twists turning points
Revelations Exposition dumps sudden

559
00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:57.780
entrances twins separated at Birth
waking up and it was all a dream and

560
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.079
anything in a plot that can be concealed
from an audience does not a good story

561
00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:05.460
make it's just drama but this is also
just one aspect of the filmmaking

562
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.900
process and to hold a work of media's
quality up to these twists is to

563
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.520
overlook nearly every other aspect of
Creation in film for which people have

564
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.540
dedicated their entire lives to making
these artistic and often unrecognized

565
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.680
contributions to a good movie costumes
sets special effects are just some

566
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.480
examples performances from actors and
the way that specific line readings can

567
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.720
add layers to a character that just
isn't there in the script but also

568
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.020
cinematography Direction choreography
when needed sound editing and

569
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.060
engineering and camera work if learning
a plot beat spoils a whole movie for you

570
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:47.460
it's spitting in the face of everyone
involved in this and a producer who

571
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.820
builds a whole movie around a single
plot beat is spitting in the face of

572
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.680
these people too you don't have to
reinvent the wheel to make a good movie

573
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.099
or series
the best thing to surprise your audience

574
00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:03.839
with is love and care for the content
you produce

575
00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:06.960
you know exactly how it's going to end
because they read the book or they

576
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.500
played the game
an amazing storytelling Journey isn't

577
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.359
about what shocks you
but what makes you care

578
00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:20.280
and
that is what happened with The Last of
