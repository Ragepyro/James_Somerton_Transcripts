1
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.280
mankind has always found an innate
horror in things that are different

2
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.280
an evolutionary reflex to protect itself
from the things that may be dangerous to

3
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.240
them or their loved ones
eons ago human beings found homo erectus

4
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.960
to be terrifying
because it was different leading to

5
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.320
their assumed extinction
this is not entirely unlike the reaction

6
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.159
toward homosexuality from the
heterosexual majority

7
00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.680
something different something strange
something queer

8
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.960
something that goes against what they
believe to be the natural order of

9
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.840
things
and that in and of itself is the initial

10
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.759
seed of horror
being afraid of things you do not

11
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.399
understand things that do not belong
creatures and events that go against

12
00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.640
your own survival needs
a son or daughter that bears no children

13
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.080
could possibly lead to the end of your
lineage

14
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.720
and what else do you exist for other
than to procreate

15
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.000
in the days and years before the rise of
mesopotamia

16
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.640
egypt greece rome what was there to
civilization

17
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.760
or creating the next generation of
people

18
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.000
and homosexuals both men and women
could theoretically put a stop to that

19
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.319
and so it can be assumed that from the
very beginning of time homosexuality was

20
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.120
looked at as
not just a societal other but a danger

21
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.560
to mankind itself though like many
things existing before the written word

22
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
this proved to be untrue
this idea along with other fanciful

23
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.080
creations of pre-history
has survived into the modern age the

24
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.319
notion of homosexuality as a danger to
mankind as a whole has been disproven

25
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.040
time and time again but sometimes
ancient teachings are hard to be

26
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000
forgotten
and so the queer entered into the horror

27
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.080
canon
centuries before hollywood even existed

28
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.840
before horror movies graced the silver
screen before the works of bram stoker

29
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.519
and mary shelley sent chills down reader
spines

30
00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.120
before the people of salem burned those
accused of being witches alive

31
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.599
before even the murder of saint
sebastian

32
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.319
the fear of the unknown according to the
american psychological association

33
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.280
is one of the most prominent causes for
anxiety among people in both the first

34
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.519
and third world
it accounts for the hatred toward

35
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.879
anything existing outside the norm
in bathroom laws across the united

36
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.480
states
in the banning of immigrants in the

37
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.920
murder of non-white people
in the remaining animosity toward

38
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.640
homosexuals
and anyone looked at as queer but this

39
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.799
was not always the case
for millennia homosexuality and gender

40
00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.519
fluidity were not things to fear but
things to embrace if not celebrate

41
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.800
egypt had gay and lesbian and by all
accounts transgender pharaohs and queens

42
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.919
mesopotamia had gay kings most of the
ancient greek philosophers were gay or

43
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.800
bisexual
rome had gay emperors and senators even

44
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.880
early christianity was
more or less accepting of gay men but

45
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.759
that didn't last

46
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.160
along with the dark ages came a great
tumult that led to the fear of anything

47
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.800
and anyone non-christian
women became witches gay men became

48
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.919
warlocks
and the very idea of homosexuality was

49
00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.880
attributed to demonic possession
if not from satan himself than from the

50
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.840
pagan deities that lingered and swept
down from the north

51
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.280
and that is where our story of gay
horror picks up

52
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.520
hundreds of years later
with a coven of witches

53
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.960
the craft released in 1996 holds an odd
appeal within the lgbt community

54
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.120
there are no queer characters but
the coding the film follows the story of

55
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.479
four teenage girls who each grow up
feeling different in one way or another

56
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.240
special and above the fray of their
peers

57
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.000
or rejected by them entirely as so many
queer teens have experienced

58
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.199
either being praised for their artistic
prowess and theater

59
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.120
art or dance are roundly rejected by the
populace at large

60
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.639
for being different by happenstance the
four girls end up in the same school

61
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.160
and find each other essentially by
cruising the hallways

62
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.240
sideways looks and quiet nods to each
other lead to

63
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.440
hookup which for them is going
shopping for candles after school

64
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.680
the most memorable character by all
accounts is nancy

65
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.360
and she's already out as a witch openly
practicing the craft

66
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.840
she wears goth lipstick and black laced
up stevie nicks boots

67
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.560
she has a sexual history and a noose
hanging in her locker

68
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.000
bonnie is a girl with self-image issues
due to scars that cover her arms and

69
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
back like so many queer kids she just
wants to be left alone

70
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.960
yet she fears that in the end that's
exactly the thing that will happen

71
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.560
that she'll grow up lonely never finding
love

72
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.520
rochelle the only black character faces
racist comments from the other students

73
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.840
angering her but only insofar as pouting
about what they did to her cashmere

74
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.000
sweater
this isn't a movie about racism after

75
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.520
all it's about wikiphobia
and finally sarah the main character

76
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.800
isn't sure about her identity at all in
the beginning

77
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.560
she starts out craft curious
this is her journey she's confronted

78
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.479
with peer pressure and her own
internalized wichiphobia

79
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.479
back at school the next day she doesn't
want to be rejected by the popular kids

80
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.319
so
she downplays her relationship with

81
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.720
nancy bonnie and rochelle
chris your typical teenage movie

82
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.160
football jock
persists in making bullying comments

83
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.400
about the three spiritual deviants
who he calls the [Â __Â ] of eastwick

84
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.360
because he's just so clever after the
four witches have confirmed each other's

85
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.400
witchy tendencies
the four take a bus to the witchy part

86
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.680
of town where a young person can go and
be themselves

87
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.479
a safe space with no anti-witch judgment
in the movie the neighborhood seems to

88
00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:03.280
be an empty grassy field but to many a
queer youth watching it in 1996

89
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.280
it was the castro district of san
francisco chelsea in new york or church

90
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.520
street in toronto
whether a place safe for witches or gays

91
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.599
the bus driver knows exactly
where he's going to take them warning

92
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.759
them

93
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:29.599
gay icon confirmed what follows are
multiple scenes resembling radical queer

94
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.519
fairy gatherings
where they call the corners and chant

95
00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:37.760
hail to the guardians
they also perform a ceremony that might

96
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.039
someday constitute polyamorous marriage
later the girls hold a body electric

97
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.959
workshop where they play
light as a feather stiff as a board

98
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:50.640
empowered by their chosen family the
girls inadvertently start causing their

99
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.959
revenge fantasies to come true
these revenge scenarios are framed in

100
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:59.360
classic locations of gay teen drama
the white racist begins losing her

101
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.080
blonde hair while showering in the gym
locker room

102
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.200
the football jock falls in love with one
of the witches and is then driven crazy

103
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.480
when the love is unrequited sadly the
film's narrative wraps up as witchcraft

104
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.240
backfires on the girls
thereby illustrating the dangers of

105
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.240
non-conformity
the girls survive only by vowing to

106
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.200
never practice the craft again
they all end up back in the closet

107
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.360
except one
who ends up in a straitjacket being

108
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.160
released the same year the defensive
marriage act was put in place

109
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.519
and only two years after the don't ask
don't tell policy was passed

110
00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:39.279
the craft became an instant hit an
occult sensation

111
00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.200
that would be played at gay halloween
parties for literally decades to come

112
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.120
as mentioned before the connection
between witches and homosexuality has

113
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.320
gone back centuries if not millennia
lesbians were accused of witchcraft more

114
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.560
than any other group of women
and gay men were regularly accused of

115
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.440
being warlocks
or simply possessed by satan

116
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.640
it's always funny really that the
christian right wing believes that god's

117
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.399
main adversary is so interested in us
we should take it as a compliment really

118
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.519
in modern wicca homosexuality is highly
embraced

119
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:17.120
although heteronormativity was a strict
rule among wiccans in the early to mid

120
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.480
20th century
newer wiccan traditions often avoid or

121
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.320
disregard the historical aversion to
lgbt people

122
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.480
these new traditions often cite the
charge of the goddess which states

123
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.160
all acts of love and pleasure are my
rituals

124
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.360
many queer christians have found that
the teachings of the church led them

125
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.200
down the path of wicca and witchcraft
witchcraft on the other hand offered a

126
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.959
spiritual space where queer people could
step into their personal power and

127
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:51.360
explore otherness without shame
guilt or fear though most

128
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.800
self-identified witches begin dabbling
in magic at a young age

129
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.120
it's not until after puberty that it
becomes a real draw for them

130
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.360
furthermore the idea of a coven creates
a space for community

131
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.440
a spiritual place where one can be
themselves without the ever-present

132
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.680
evangelical eye though many would
suspect that modern witches grew up in

133
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.320
ultra-liberal hippie-esque environments
today over 80 percent of self-identified

134
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.079
witches grew up in right-wing christian
homes

135
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:26.079
an environment that seems rife for
creating things that are very

136
00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:29.839
unchristian

137
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.279
based on the best-selling novel by queer
ally stephen king

138
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:41.600
carrie tells the story of kerry white
teenage girl trying desperately to make

139
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.519
it through her high school years
she's bullied for being a bit different

140
00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:49.200
for being shy
for not fitting in and like many young

141
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.240
christians
doesn't feel at home in the stifling

142
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.200
environment of an evangelical household
possibly the most obvious queer coding

143
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.320
in the story is when carrie's ultra
religious mother

144
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.880
actually locks her in a closet declaring
that she'll be sent to hell and punished

145
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.760
for being
who she is if she continues down this

146
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.440
sinful path carrie has a crush you see
on the high school heartthrob tommy and

147
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.440
like many a gay boy and girl in their
high school years he is completely

148
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.279
unattainable until he's not
until he's suddenly interested in carrie

149
00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:29.839
a predicament both thrilling
and terrifying how many queer high

150
00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:34.160
schoolers have been in that position
having a crush on a boy or girl thinking

151
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.600
there's no way that they could possibly
be into you

152
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.160
that they're most likely straight
approaching them romantically may even

153
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.000
end in violence
especially in the 1970s when the book

154
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.760
and movie came out
this can easily be placed on most high

155
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.000
schoolers who feel like they don't fit
in

156
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.720
but it's particularly salient for queer
kids

157
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.320
i myself had a crush in junior high
we'll call him

158
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.720
dan he knew i was gay and seemed
relatively accepting but the

159
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.680
ever-existing caveat
but i'm not gay so you know don't try

160
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.160
anything always hovered over the
friendship

161
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.320
i knew there was no chance and then one
night my friends and i

162
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.720
were having a movie night six of us were
piled into my room watching bram

163
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.720
stoker's dracula itself
full of queer imagery and while most

164
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.399
everyone had spread out around the room
dan and i ended up in my bed a single

165
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.399
bed with barely enough room for me let
alone another six foot soccer player

166
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:37.839
he didn't seem to mind though nothing
happened between us of course

167
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:41.120
but knowing that my straight best friend
was okay

168
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.199
practically cuddling with me made me
pretty happy

169
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:49.120
no such luck for carrie white though or
most queer kids

170
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.600
after much bullying even by characters
not coded strictly as villains

171
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.120
carrie is invited to the prom the
epitome of high school heteronormativity

172
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.880
not just invited but invited by the most
all-american crush she could possibly

173
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.240
have the epitome of the high school
crush archetype

174
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.240
not of his own volition mind you but by
the cajoling of his girlfriend sue who

175
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.680
seems to be the only decent person in
the entire school

176
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.480
but carrie doesn't know that she gets to
believe for just a little while

177
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.320
that a boy like that could really like
her and to make it all that much better

178
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.839
the rabid [Â __Â ] who's been making her
high school life a living hell

179
00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:30.959
won't even be there thanks to the help
of a

180
00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.800
coded lesbian gym teacher eventually
voted prom queen

181
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.079
carries on top of the world and then the
rug is pulled out from under her

182
00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:43.680
a bucket of pig's blood is pulled from
the rafters

183
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.519
coating her head to toe and suddenly the
realization hits

184
00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:52.959
the fear that every queer kid holds down
deep inside

185
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:58.079
that they'll be accepted lauded even
just for it all to be one big practical

186
00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:01.680
joke
pranks like these are not uncommon

187
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.360
there's a reason every outsider in high
school fears them

188
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.920
pig's blood usually isn't involved but
raising up an oddball student

189
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.040
to the very highest of heights just to
push them off at the edge

190
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.839
it does happen this is when most would
run off the stage in horror and shame

191
00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:23.760
hide from the people who did this but
not carrie

192
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.279
not unlike the videos we see of high
school kids fighting back against their

193
00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:30.560
bullies
carrie strikes back in a vicious and

194
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.320
bloody attack
that leaves the prom coded in even more

195
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.880
blood than she
fires rage around the gymnasium as she

196
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.720
makes her way through it
a revenge fantasy for every teenager who

197
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.519
has ever been
othered made fun of bullied attacked

198
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:51.199
held down carries a horror to mainstream
audiences

199
00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.800
terrified of the other but a hero to
queer kids

200
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.040
and everyone who doesn't fit in a
literal horror superhero

201
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.440
director of the 2013 remake lesbian
director kimberly pierce said

202
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.320
i think another queer part of the
narrative is that carrie gets

203
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.600
superpowers
and those superpowers are like a queer

204
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.160
person understanding that they have a
talent

205
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.920
or a queer person finally coming to
terms with their gender identity

206
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.279
or sexual preference and saying even if
this is not the mainstream it's okay

207
00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:25.600
because that's literally what carrie
says she says to her mom

208
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.160
there are other people out there like me
i am normal i am okay

209
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.680
even if you don't think so i've talked
to

210
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.360
a lot of gay people and they love the
revenge tale

211
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.199
love that carrie gets even they love
that she goes after the people that did

212
00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:44.240
this to her
it's an echo of what a queer person

213
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.759
could write as a kind of
corrective narrative given carrie's

214
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:51.279
status as a cultural icon her
simultaneous status as horror film

215
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.320
victim and monster
alongside the narrative concerning her

216
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.720
burgeoning sexuality and attraction to
boys

217
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.880
she may well be situated as a powerful
figure of identification for gay male

218
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.799
viewers
kerry's narrative can also be read as a

219
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:08.720
variation on the coming out tale both
sexually and socially

220
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.799
and revolves around the awkwardness of
revealing one's own sexuality to one's

221
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:15.839
parents
especially one's mother and the guilt or

222
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:21.199
shame involved in doing so
the film also has both cult and camp

223
00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:25.199
lure
mainly from its use of excess a staple

224
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:29.760
of director brian de palma
in the excessive style and form of his

225
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.000
direction in terms of lighting
color coding and the melodramatic use of

226
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.160
music and score
of course in the end from my point of

227
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.039
view anyway
kerry is all about shame much like the

228
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:46.640
shame of gay teenagers and certain types
of families

229
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.000
certain kinds of home towns not fitting
in

230
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.039
being ostracized even when you try to
fit in

231
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:56.480
and this shame is personified by carrie
white

232
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.600
gay audiences form a connection with
carrie

233
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.039
unlike with most horror heroines she is
the internalized anxiety within us

234
00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:08.559
the yearning to be something more to fit
in

235
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:14.160
and yet be ourselves to not be bullied
or at least to fight back against the

236
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.840
bully but we're not all carrie white
sometimes that self-hatred internalizes

237
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.160
something dark and morbid
roiling within our bodies a demon

238
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.840
ravaging our very soul

239
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.320
demons are not just beings of pain and
torment and clive barker's hellraiser

240
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.039
they're moral abominations creatures so
lost in hedonism

241
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:47.600
they've long since forgotten the
difference between pain and pleasure

242
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.799
demons that could be mistaken or even
accepted for

243
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:54.720
angels from a certain point of view
though many would question the queerness

244
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.360
of hellraiser it lurches
well beyond breaking heteronormativity

245
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.919
it skins it alive written and directed
by clive barker and based on his novella

246
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:07.120
the hell-bound heart
hellraiser tells the story of frank

247
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.240
cotton a man who has broken
every imaginable sexual taboo who has

248
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.440
crossed
every human limit and has still not met

249
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.200
his fill of sexual sadism
bdsm has become all too vanilla for him

250
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.320
and so he searches out an infernal
puzzle box

251
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.240
that when solved summons
interdimensional beings known as the

252
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.360
cenobites
creatures that dwell in a realm of

253
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.919
extreme kernel indulgence
where people are willingly subjected to

254
00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:40.400
severe forms of sadomasochism
that include but are surely not limited

255
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.880
to
being torn apart by hooks and chains

256
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.640
clearly this amalgamation of pleasure
and pain is extremely hyperbolized for

257
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.760
the sake of horror
but it doesn't feel too far off from the

258
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.840
way queer people in the bdsm community
are often perceived by those who don't

259
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.880
understand
that subculture that's the key variable

260
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.880
that makes hellraiser so special
parker is entirely aware of

261
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.840
heteronormative insecurities such as
versions of polyamory involving frank

262
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.280
and his mistress julia
barker takes these insecurities and

263
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.400
combines them with imagery derived from
the underground leather scene of the

264
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.159
time
mixed with the art of herronius bach in

265
00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:22.640
order to create a film
about the broad spectrum of sensuality

266
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.480
and sexuality
he shocked audiences with its subversive

267
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.400
but wildly inclusive material
even more important is the fact that

268
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.520
clive barker created this story as a gay
man

269
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.120
which allows queer representation to
transcend the page and screen making

270
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.559
hellraiser resonate even more profoundly
having always been interested in

271
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:46.799
monsters it could be safe to assume that
barker was fascinated by outsiders and

272
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:51.600
outcasts like his creations
because he could relate to them and he

273
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.039
wasn't alone
the queer bdsm culture of the time

274
00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:59.840
welcomed hellraiser with open arms
indulging in its allegorical betrayal of

275
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.440
kink
polyamory and queerness this subgroup of

276
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.480
the lgbt community grew quickly in the
1980s

277
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.600
as a way to experience sexual pleasure
that didn't involve penile penetration

278
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.400
avoiding hiv by learning a whole new way
of enjoying pleasure

279
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.200
and pain and to many in the queer
community they were looked at as freaks

280
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.000
monsters horrors to be avoided at any
cost

281
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.679
what does it mean to be considered a
monster

282
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:34.559
by monsters even in harry and benshoff's
book monsters in the closet

283
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:38.799
which you'll no doubt notice shares a
title with this video's spiritual

284
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:42.240
predecessor
barker's work remains somewhat marginal

285
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.240
benchoff recognizes hellraiser for some
of its visual characteristics but comes

286
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.159
to the conclusion that
too often the representation of barker's

287
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:53.520
monster queers
seems similar to those produced by

288
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.760
right-wing ideologues
benshoff's book borrows many theories

289
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.360
put forward by robin wood in the late
1970s

290
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.200
in a series of essays would examine the
ways in which horror films reflect

291
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.640
repression
in contemporary society this study

292
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.000
attempts to shine a light on the shapes
that lurk in the shadows

293
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.840
and the way that the introduction of the
monster disrupts society

294
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.120
according to wood the basic formula of
the horror film

295
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.799
is that normality is threatened by the
monster

296
00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:26.320
one of the controversial aspects of
wood's article is the distinction

297
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.480
that he makes between what he perceives
to be progressive and reactionary

298
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.760
reprehensible movements within the genre
this notion of reprehensible horror

299
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.600
continues to be a presence in monsters
in the closet and it would appear

300
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.200
that this attitude contributes greatly
to ben schaff's

301
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.600
general disdain for barker's work while
there is merit to the criticism that

302
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.480
there is a lack of positive queer
representation in hellraiser

303
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.080
the logic applied by both wood and
benshoff remains deeply

304
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.679
problematic their argument revolves
around the notion that

305
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:02.480
films like hellraiser want us to reject
the sights we see as being repugnant or

306
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.280
negative
when the reality is that barker finds

307
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.039
these images to be compelling
and horror film audiences are more

308
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:13.200
likely to be fascinated than disgusted
even if one accepts that the queer

309
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.919
images and hellraiser are not positive
ones

310
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.960
how does that make these representations
reprehensible

311
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.919
to a large extent the queers in
hellraiser belong to a pantheon of

312
00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:26.159
hyperbolically monstrous gay characters
of the likes of which populate the films

313
00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:28.960
of john waters
in his analysis of character

314
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.200
construction and gay narrative film
tom wah points out the irresistible

315
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.080
attraction by gay authors to images that
seem

316
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.679
harmful in the viewfinders of movement
ideologues

317
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:43.039
that accepting the fact that a bdsm
subculture exists within the queer

318
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:46.880
community further others us from the
heteronormative white picket fences of

319
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.000
the suburbs
and what is a queer person if they're

320
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.640
not accepted by the suburban rabble
a monster of course but there's an odd

321
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.600
attractiveness to the monsters of
hellraiser

322
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.120
when they move and speak there's a
certain degree of attractive nobility in

323
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.880
their appearance
these debauched angels may commit

324
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.960
visceral acts of savagery
but they also possess a surprising grace

325
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.640
and eloquence
while benshoff may view these creatures

326
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.400
as monster queers that are
not at all positive representations of

327
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.440
the community
it must needs be remarked that the

328
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.840
cenobites and hellraiser fit more
comfortably into the role of anti-hero

329
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.600
than that of the monster when our
protagonist kirstie

330
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.200
is confronted by the cenobites after
solving the puzzle box herself

331
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.279
and demands to know who they are she is
met with the reply

332
00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:40.960
explorers in the further regions of
experience

333
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:47.360
demons to some angels to
others introduction implies that their

334
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.640
prey
chooses them not the other way around if

335
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.400
one assumes that their typical victim is
someone like frank

336
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.080
then it becomes apparent that their
talents are actively sought out by

337
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.840
hedonists
who are looking for new experiences when

338
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.159
they encounter an innocent
the cenobites unlike other slashers can

339
00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:08.720
be reasoned with
their appearance may mark them as

340
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.919
outsiders but they pose no serious
threat to

341
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:19.360
normal people who wish to remain normal
just like any good master or dom they

342
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.080
don't want you
if you don't want them if the cenobites

343
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.480
are not truly the monster then what is
it would appear that the film's real

344
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.640
monster queer is frank
the undead beast the cenobites

345
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.279
unwittingly leave behind
he is the one that truly threatens

346
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:40.240
normality
when he returns to earth to resurrect

347
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.000
his long abandoned flesh
he intends to kill innocent people to

348
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.960
make it happen
frank the man is the monster

349
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.320
the man you'd walk by in a mall and not
give a second look

350
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.760
the man you'd say hello to in an
elevator he

351
00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.000
is the real beast in hellraiser not the
cenobites

352
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.360
like how you're more likely to be raped
or killed by your husband

353
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.640
than anyone you'd meet in an s m club
the hell priest eventually christened

354
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.120
pinhead by fans
though barker loads the name is not a

355
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.320
mindless killer like jason voris or
michael myers

356
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.880
he's not a killer of innocence like
freddy krueger he is reasonable

357
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:27.200
and only comes when called keeps to
himself in his own realm much like the

358
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.760
queer community that lived in cities and
was not

359
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.640
infiltrating suburbs as so many white
americans feared in the late 1980s

360
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.279
though he and his fellow cenobites would
grow closer to their slasher brethren as

361
00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:44.159
the hellraiser series went on
in the original he is not the monster to

362
00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:49.120
be fear
the perfectly normal person was

363
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:57.300
but perfectly normal people
do have a habit of being monsters

364
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.069
[Music]

365
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.559
jennifer's body is the story more or
less of anita lesniki

366
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:14.000
needy for short once an insecure teenage
girl she is now a violent inmate in a

367
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.120
mental ward
narrating her story from solitary

368
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.240
confinement
since early childhood she had been

369
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.320
friends with the titular jennifer
though they had little in common with

370
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.559
needy being shy and reserved
and jennifer being a cheerleader

371
00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:31.919
together the pair
attend a local rock concert at a bar

372
00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:36.480
where needy's life
changes forever a fire with no known

373
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.159
source
engulfs the bar killing multiple people

374
00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.200
needy pleads with jennifer to stay with
her but in her shock

375
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.520
she leaves with the band later that
night she turns up at needy's house

376
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.039
covered in blood
the next day at school she acts as if

377
00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:54.399
everything is right with the world
the town is devastated by the fire and

378
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:58.480
the death it caused
but not jennifer her mind is set

379
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.159
elsewhere
the captain of the football team who she

380
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:06.799
seduces
and disembowels after multiple murders

381
00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:10.399
it is revealed that on the night of the
fire the band had taken jennifer into

382
00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:14.159
the woods and offered her up as a virgin
sacrifice to satan himself

383
00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:18.880
in exchange for fame and fortune but
jennifer not being a virgin

384
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.840
was instead possessed discovering that
jennifer is now a succubus who will feed

385
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.039
off of human life to sustain herself
needy decides to take action after a

386
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.520
failed attempt that leaves her boyfriend
dead

387
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.880
she manages to kill jennifer and the
demon inside her

388
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.919
just in time for jennifer's mother to
discover her on top of her daughter's

389
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:41.840
corpse
so off to briarcliff she goes though

390
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.679
loathed upon release the film has more
recently been reevaluated as a modern

391
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:50.080
horror classic
it's fun messy mean sad campy and

392
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.240
self-aware
it's worth mentioning that the

393
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.399
advertising campaign for jennifer's body
was

394
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:59.360
deeply flawed portraying it as a sexy
thriller in order to play off of star

395
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.120
megan fox's hotness
it attempted to appeal to the male fans

396
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:08.240
of the transformers franchise
entirely the wrong audience it seemingly

397
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.559
borrows its premise from rape revenge
movies and can easily be read that way

398
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:15.919
at first glance
what's captivating about it though is

399
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:20.080
that you soon realize
that it is not what the film is actually

400
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.039
about
what happens to the abusers in the movie

401
00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:26.640
is more an afterthought
played over the closing credits as needy

402
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.760
having escaped the asylum
kills the band who corrupted her friend

403
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.840
the actual beating heart of the story is
a messy codependent romance between

404
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.720
needy and jennifer
the initial scene that seems to be

405
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.640
played for laughs in the movie
is of needy ogling jennifer as she

406
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.200
cheerleads
showing a deep yearning for the

407
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.720
raven-haired beauty most of the
remainder of the film is spent

408
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.080
escalating the warped hungry tension
between the two girls

409
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.159
meanwhile chip needy's boyfriend
essentially falls into the role that

410
00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:59.360
usually is held for the girlfriend in a
horror movie

411
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.440
he's either there to pose a problem for
the tumultuous relationship

412
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.559
or needs to be rescued for instance
early on in the movie chip stands

413
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:11.760
helplessly by while the girls giggling
amongst themselves

414
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.240
enter into a play pushing fight until
jennifer pushes needy just a little too

415
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.679
hard
instantly reading like a scene from an

416
00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:24.559
elementary school playground or a boy
plays a bit too rough with a girl

417
00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:27.520
because he likes her
the undercurrent of tension or even

418
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.799
hostility is soon mirrored by needy
herself

419
00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:34.000
when she accompanies jennifer to the
aforementioned concert

420
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.840
she looks on uncomfortably as jennifer
plays up the role of the sweet awkward

421
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.799
doe-eyed girl in the hopes of getting
the lead singer's romantic attention

422
00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.799
and retreats until she overhears the
band talking about jennifer being a

423
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:49.840
virgin
needy takes this as her cue to storm up

424
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.200
to the band taking on what looks to be a
protector role

425
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.880
insisting that jennifer is a virgin
which is something she knows to be

426
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.080
untrue
she also insists that jennifer is not

427
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.519
going to sleep with a band of slammy
scumbags amanda seyfried's delivery in

428
00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:08.960
this scene evokes more than a protective
drive though

429
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.360
there's a current of jealous
defensiveness roiling just underneath it

430
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.360
she genuinely believes that jennifer is
too good to sleep with the band

431
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.279
she also resents that jennifer was even
considering it

432
00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:25.039
she wants jennifer to be considering
sleeping with her instead

433
00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:30.320
though it's never stated outright the
coding though is obvious enough for

434
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.880
most anyone to see later when jennifer
grabs and squeezes needy's hand during

435
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.080
the concert proper needy is appeased and
even relieved

436
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.919
she smiles warmly adoringly over at
jennifer

437
00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:46.480
her smile only fades when she realizes
jennifer isn't looking back at her

438
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.960
and only has eyes for the band she
releases jennifer's hand abruptly

439
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.240
and we see the fading white patches
where jennifer had gripped her hand just

440
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.080
a little too hard
as mentioned before later that night a

441
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.120
bloodied maimed
non-verbal and snarling jennifer

442
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.840
staggers over to needy's house in the
middle of the night

443
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.000
desperate and hungry though jennifer is
unable or unwilling to communicate in

444
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.320
words what's happened to her
her physicality is speaking volumes this

445
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.760
is clearly a nod to both physical
manifestations of trauma

446
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.760
and a general reference to women in
horror movies and in real life

447
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.000
who can't talk about what's happening to
them or fear that they won't be believed

448
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.240
or understood this scene doesn't just
focus on the horror of the situation

449
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.120
though
the sexual tension between the two also

450
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.840
comes into focus as jennifer narrowly
resists biting needy on the neck

451
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.760
looking more like a kiss than a
potentially violent act

452
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.279
their relationship is stretched thin
over a tumultuous friendship between

453
00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:46.240
teenage girls
but more than that it speaks to the

454
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.919
nature of attraction between young women
whose relationships can be incredibly

455
00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:55.919
intimate
even between two straight girls so when

456
00:32:55.919 --> 00:33:00.399
one or both of the girls are gay or bi
the thin line between platonic female

457
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:04.799
friendship and sexual female love can
become an emotional war zone

458
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:08.399
jennifer uses sex as bait to attract
male victims to devour

459
00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:11.679
but shows no romantic interest in any of
them

460
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:17.120
their prey nothing else to her one scene
shows the uncomfortable simultaneous

461
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.840
acts of jennifer seducing a soon-to-be
victim

462
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.360
while needy makes love to her bumbling
boyfriend

463
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.279
looking at the scene through the eye of
a film editor it's easy enough to see

464
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:30.720
what's happening
jennifer is the aggressor in her scene

465
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.399
while needy
is the submissive partner in hers the

466
00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:37.600
cutting back and forth can easily be
read as an editing trick to make the

467
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.480
mind see jennifer needy having sex
backing up that interpretation is the

468
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.679
fact that needy abandons her
heterosexual coupling in order to seek

469
00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:48.559
out jennifer
after a series of scares she returns

470
00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:52.880
home alone
unable to find her friend crawling into

471
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.200
bed she finds jennifer there waiting for
her

472
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.840
wearing one of needy's shirts a
girlfriend move if ever there was one

473
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.200
this scene of vulnerability culminates
with an actual kiss between the two

474
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.039
girls
needy pulls away demanding to know what

475
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:11.440
jennifer has been up to
she tells her her story ending it with

476
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.280
the line
anyway i don't really remember what

477
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.839
happened after that i just know that i
woke up

478
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:23.599
and i found my way back to you
after all that though needy begins to

479
00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:27.359
doubt jennifer's story
feeling her control and her closeness to

480
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:30.639
needy slipping
jennifer reaches for the nearest easy

481
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.839
target
by trying to make needy insecure about

482
00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:38.560
her relationship with chip
suggesting that chip is having second

483
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.280
thoughts about her
this is the first but not the last

484
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.720
effort of jennifer's to drive a wedge
between the couple

485
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.960
and doing so right on the heels of an
attempted romantic overture

486
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.000
is hard to read as anything
else than her wanting needy for herself

487
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.839
the lesbian coding is incredibly obvious
come on needy let me stay the night we

488
00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:04.640
can play boyfriend girlfriend like we
used to

489
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.839
at the climax of the film needy
confronts jennifer armed with a box

490
00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:10.560
cutter
leading to an acerbic little double

491
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.760
entendre on the slaying meaning of the
word box

492
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.599
and jennifer quipping that needy buying
her murder weapons at home depot is so

493
00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.760
butch this is also the scene in which
jennifer finally bites needy while

494
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.720
they're fighting
the bite isn't lethal though and it's

495
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.640
clear that it wasn't meant to be
to me there's a very interesting reading

496
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.920
of jennifer's body
the queer teenage girls whose

497
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.520
sexualities are only starting to bloom
can easily become confused about their

498
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.119
relationships with other girls
straight girls and women have much

499
00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:42.640
closer more intimate relationships than
straight boys and men

500
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.800
if you see two girls holding hands you
might not think anything of it

501
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.079
if you see a girl running her hand
through another girl's hair

502
00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:53.280
she's probably just trying to help her
relax

503
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.680
kiss on the cheek or even lips
that's nothing if you hear two women say

504
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.640
i love you you don't immediately think
lesbians well there is a much stricter

505
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.200
code of conduct for men and boys
no hand holding no hugs that last for

506
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.960
too long
and a kiss or an i love you even between

507
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.000
fathers and sons
absolutely not and so there's a bit of

508
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.160
gay male privilege there if another boy
or man is acting very close and intimate

509
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.520
the assumption can be made that he's at
the very least not homophobic

510
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.680
and quite possibly open to something
more the situation is easier to read

511
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.280
because there are so many barriers put
up between men

512
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.680
a possible upside to toxic masculinity
but for young women how can you tell if

513
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.240
another girl is interested in you
in a romantic or sexual way because she

514
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.839
kissed you
held her hand cuddled you've likely been

515
00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:46.240
doing that with female friends all your
life

516
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.079
as if being a woman wasn't hard enough

517
00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.839
already

518
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.839
1979's alien directed by ridley scott is
often considered as one of the first

519
00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:08.000
feminist science fiction movies with its
powerful central female

520
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.839
character and themes of reproduction and
sexual violence the film has become

521
00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:16.560
lauded for being a cornerstone
in feminist film theory it's also

522
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.560
monstrously queer
not only is ellen ripley a strong butch

523
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.560
heroine
who does not at all fit the usual sci-fi

524
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.960
or
horror female archetype but according to

525
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.760
david mcentee author of beautiful
monsters the film

526
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.000
also plays very deliberately with male
fears of female reproduction

527
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.920
forcing the gestation of life onto male
characters and literally tearing them

528
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.800
apart during birth
but the queerness in alien reaches

529
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.880
beyond the obvious
when writing the screenplay dan o'bannon

530
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.160
wanted to focus more on developing the
xenomorph as a character

531
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.560
and so when writing the crew he left
them more or less generic

532
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.640
which included their gender a note on
the script reads

533
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.599
the crew is unisex and all parts are
interchangeable for men or women

534
00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:05.359
from the conception of this story there
is a rejection of performative

535
00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:09.760
gender from initial perceptions all of
our characters are similarly gendered

536
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.960
neutral
they wear the same loose jumpsuits and

537
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.079
are addressed by their surnames
removing any bases for gendered pronouns

538
00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.839
the ship's male mechanics complain about
being paid less than everyone else

539
00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:26.320
including the female crew at a time in
america when women were being paid 60

540
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.040
cents for every dollar a man made
once cast and the actors were given the

541
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.240
freedom to play their
parts as masculine or feminine star

542
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.720
sigourney weaver decided to play her
character as completely gender-neutral

543
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.880
in horror especially at the time of
release female characters were always

544
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.000
portrayed as victims or damsels in
distress

545
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.359
while an alien ripley is neither of
those things

546
00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:53.359
she's strong and self-reliant
furthermore when ripley asserts

547
00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:56.640
authority in the team after dallas is
caught by the alien

548
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.520
ash the male robot feels threatened and
attempts to dominate ripley

549
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.160
to regain his masculinity he's a
genderless robot

550
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.160
however he exemplifies constructed toxic
masculinity

551
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.599
aggression a fragile ego and
stubbornness

552
00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:18.880
he attacks ripley who exemplifies gender
neutrality and sexual equality

553
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.880
literally attacking her with gender
conformity by shoving a porn magazine

554
00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.200
down her throat
another male character kane is orally

555
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.839
raped by the facehugger
this leads to a forced impregnation

556
00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:35.520
leading to death
in what is essentially childbirth

557
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.359
removing the assumed male privilege of
avoiding the pain of childbirth and

558
00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:44.640
bringing it to a horrific conclusion
not only is kane raped and killed but

559
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.440
gives birth to a vicious
bloodthirsty phallus it's been no secret

560
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.599
that h.r geiger designed every form of
the xenomorph to represent sex organs

561
00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:58.320
both male and female masculine and
feminine the overt and grotesque sexual

562
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.079
imagery in the alien is designed to
evoke fear and anxiety

563
00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:05.599
which is how society was already
responding to sexual openness

564
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:09.359
and breaking out of what it means to be
typically male and female

565
00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:13.200
the aliens phallic and vaginal
components are used together in stark

566
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.680
contrast from the traits and qualities
usually assigned to them thus

567
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.079
deconstructing notions of gender
the alien's body is overtly sexual and

568
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:27.040
blurs our ideas of anatomy
the horror and sexual violence from the

569
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.720
alien including the penetration of
lambert and forcing dallas into a

570
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.960
womb-like egg
as an allusion to motherhood suggests

571
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.319
that having one pair of genitals or
another doesn't make you inherently

572
00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:41.200
violent
but that society's construction of

573
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.200
gender is to blame
we get a less coded queer representation

574
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.440
in 1986's sequel
when for a split second we see a

575
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.640
biography of the character lambert from
the first film

576
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.960
the biography establishes lambert as
having had her gender reassigned

577
00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.720
from male to female lambert's bio reads
despite conversion at birth from male to

578
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.720
female so far there are no signs
of suppressed trauma from gender

579
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.119
reassignment
and so in a horror movie from 1979 we

580
00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:15.920
technically have a transgender character
who is never othered never misgendered

581
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.319
and is not a villain
a retcon that changes nothing about the

582
00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:24.079
story but adds trans representation when
little if any

583
00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:28.400
was available james cameron's aliens is
curiously progressive

584
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.920
in its sexual politics overall
especially for a movie released during

585
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.599
the reagan years
take for instance the exchange between

586
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:39.839
hudson and frost
hey i sure wouldn't mind getting some

587
00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:42.160
more of that

588
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.640
yeah the one that you had was male 1 it
doesn't matter when it's

589
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.839
so the butch space marine slept with a
man

590
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:54.880
and nobody makes a big deal out of it
except for frost

591
00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.720
who wants to do it again
and he is wholeheartedly supported this

592
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.680
isn't just queer behavior being
portrayed in a positive manner

593
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.319
but one of the many ways that the movie
obfuscates gender and supports a

594
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:12.000
pansexual ethos the queer icon of aliens
though

595
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.560
is the female space marine vasquez who
is tougher than most of the men

596
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.880
in her squad in a movie released 27
years before the united states military

597
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.920
even let women take on combat roles
but is she herself queer the actors who

598
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.839
played her jeanette goldstein
weighed in on that question in 2016.

599
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:34.480
she's an outsider
she was just who she was with vasquez i

600
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.599
never said she was straight or gay
because to her it was nobody's business

601
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:45.280
a lot of gay women come up and say oh my
god when i saw you and you had a

602
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.079
masculine look to you
i saw myself but i had straight women

603
00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:54.640
coming up to me with the same thing
someone was going through breast cancer

604
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.119
and she told me that with each round of
chemo

605
00:42:57.119 --> 00:43:02.240
she would think of vasquez a gay man
from guatemala came to me and he said i

606
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.400
identify
so much with her he was very feminine

607
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.520
vasquez is universal elsewhere in the
film

608
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.000
is bishop another sexless cyborg like
the first film's ash

609
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.599
david grevin in demeter and persephone
in space observes

610
00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:21.040
bishop the cyborg retooled as a queer
suffering body

611
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.440
is an example of a resistant masculinity
devoid of any obvious sexual desire

612
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.440
such figures suggest queer sexuality in
films and television

613
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.800
in that their refusal of the normative
codes of masculinity

614
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.079
suggest an alternative to them as with
ash but

615
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:42.720
much more pitiably the white blood that
drenches bishops suggests both mother's

616
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.119
milk and semen
but in a radical decontextualization

617
00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:50.480
semen here
suggests the vulnerability of male

618
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.079
bodies
their susceptibility to violation rather

619
00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:58.160
than unseemly urges
grevin further suggests that the aliens

620
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.839
and especially the alien queen
represent a cisgendered heteronormative

621
00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:05.680
status quo
that resents the changing times what

622
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.480
gives this entire spectacle of shaming
its radical charge is the queer typing

623
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.720
of ripley as mother
with her short hair and male garb ripley

624
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.240
combines the masculine
and the feminine with her casual

625
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.560
indifference to heterosexual sex despite
some no sweat flirtation with hicks

626
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.720
she suggests the possibility of
different sexual needs

627
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.720
with her adoption of a child she
suggests the lesbian mother who thinks

628
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.440
outside the normative procreational box
the alien queen's vicious contempt

629
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.760
conveys the charge of an old
customary inability to recognize the

630
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.839
beauty and heroism
in queer love of the kind ripley and

631
00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:48.720
newt embody
read as a queer allegory ripley newt the

632
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.800
reintegrated android bishop
and the wounded vulnerable and bedridden

633
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.960
hicks
together constitute the new queer family

634
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.720
the alien queen a repository of old
modes of contempt

635
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.880
and hate so while gribben suggests that
the conservative alien queen has

636
00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.119
contempt for the queer family dynamic
the metaphor could go even further

637
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:13.200
cameron creates a future where gender
norms have all but disappeared

638
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.599
even subtle things like fashion such as
the female whalenutani executive at

639
00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:21.040
ripley's hearing
wearing a power suit and sporting an

640
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.920
androgynous haircut
to the fact that the marines have a

641
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:29.200
co-ed locker room suggest
the battle of the sexes ended in a draw

642
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.119
it's the alien queen who although she
rules over an army of male drones is

643
00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:36.800
actually trapped within the biological
determinism of her sex

644
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.599
forever cranking out eggs she ironically
wants to destroy this new world

645
00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:45.280
and turn back the clock a few centuries
there's also the

646
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.720
aids allegory of the entire alien
franchise

647
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.720
though obviously not intended for the
first film which came out before aids

648
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.599
became well known
the sexual imagery of the xenomorph's

649
00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:58.880
many forms and the imminent death
associated with them

650
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.920
make h.r geiger's beasts easy analogues
for the deadly bloodborne virus

651
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.400
especially in the sequel where just one
alien one drop of infected blood or

652
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.400
semen can create
such an infection that completely

653
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.839
overwhelms the host planet
or body this became especially prescient

654
00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:21.359
with the release of alien 3.
the death of newton hicks before the

655
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:24.160
film even begins is central to this
message

656
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:29.040
aids seemingly kills at random the young
and innocent like newt

657
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.160
the healthy young men like hicks or
like ripley you might avoid the disease

658
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.000
by pure luck
then there's the population of fury 161

659
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.800
an almost completely abandoned prison
planet

660
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.720
one of the higher ups realizes that they
can potentially wrangle this little

661
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.760
alien problem into a profitable venture
much like how big pharma companies

662
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.920
worked on releasing
oppressively expensive treatments

663
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:59.280
instead of working toward a cure and
this speech from dylan

664
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.119
the only question is how you check out

665
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:11.200
do you want it on your feet or on your
[Â __Â ] knees

666
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.520
i ain't much for begging hitting like
larry kramer's 1987

667
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.200
speech when he launched act up the alien
created by

668
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.079
h.r geiger brought to life by ridley
scott and perfected by james cameron

669
00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:27.760
is a monster that exploited our fears of
gender sex

670
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:35.119
infection and lost control
a monster so ravenous there is no escape

671
00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:40.240
but not all monsters are so obvious

672
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.680
[Music]
it follows tells the story of jay a 19

673
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.440
year old suburban girl
who acquires a sexually transmitted

674
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.920
curse from her boyfriend hugh
after they first have sex hugh sedates

675
00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.160
her forcing her to heed his instructions
about the curse

676
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.400
she must sleep with someone as soon as
she can in order to pass it along to

677
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.400
another person
and on and on or else she'll be tracked

678
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.079
down
and killed by another worldly entity the

679
00:48:12.079 --> 00:48:15.839
titular it
if it kills her it will resume tracking

680
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.319
hue
since it follows only one person at a

681
00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:21.760
time
the monster in it follows may be a

682
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.680
supernatural being
but the film's true source of horror is

683
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.000
living under a regime of sexual shame
where our heteronormative culture

684
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.400
compels sexual subjects toward monogamy
even at the risk of their overall

685
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.880
well-being though many critics pointed
out that it follows cleverly subverts

686
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.880
the usual you have sex you die trope
from 1980 slasher movies

687
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.640
few grasped the idea that the monster in
the film would more or less become

688
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.800
harmless in a society
where sexual promiscuity was the norm

689
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.280
having sex with new partners on a
regular basis

690
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.440
constantly shifting its targets to the
point at which it could follow

691
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.319
but never catch up in time to kill
at a glance it follows would seem

692
00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:06.000
unlikely to have a queer reading since
it doesn't feature any queer characters

693
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.119
or monsters that could be easily coded
as such

694
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:12.559
nor does it feature any of the
homoerotic undertones of movies like a

695
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:16.079
nightmare on elm street ii the lost boys
or rope

696
00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:21.680
instead its queerness is less monolithic
for some viewers a horror movie that

697
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.920
depicts sexual partners spreading a
deadly curse via sex might seem deeply

698
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.359
sex negative
indeed many reviewers saw the film's

699
00:49:29.359 --> 00:49:31.760
central conceit as tapping into the
fears

700
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.960
of anyone who came of age during the
aids crisis

701
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.640
the threat of aids has of course long
been allegorically linked to popular

702
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.680
horror imagery
like the aforementioned alien john

703
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.480
carpenter's the thing
david cronenberg's the fly or any number

704
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.040
of post-80s vampire tales
but the film's queer lesson is less

705
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.520
about the avoidance of sex
than the management of risk after all

706
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.440
according to the film's logic those
infected by the curse can survive only

707
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.599
by successfully
finding new sexual partners

708
00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:07.520
versus remaining abstinent and living
out the fatal consequences of their

709
00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.920
prior sexual history
the film barely acknowledges that jay

710
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.200
has any other option but to find new
partners

711
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:19.200
and it's her hesitance to move beyond a
series of monogamous bonds that

712
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.520
could ultimately prove to be her
downfall therefore the film implies that

713
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.960
having a sex life is
inevitable and always involves a certain

714
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.119
level of risk emotional or physical
but the film also suggests that the

715
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:35.040
danger truly lies in the social
attitudes that make sex and promiscuity

716
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.319
shameful
we're also told very clearly that jay

717
00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:43.119
was not a virgin at the beginning
of the film when she acquired the curse

718
00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:46.640
and therefore the allegorical infection
shouldn't be looked at as some kind of

719
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:51.520
punishment for premarital
or non-procreative sex as it would be in

720
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.880
so many other movies in the genre
importantly neither hugh nor the film in

721
00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.920
general
ever specify which sexual acts will

722
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:05.040
successfully pass along the curse
thus opening plenty of space for queer

723
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.960
speculation
is heterosexual sex the only option will

724
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.200
same-sex partners do the trick
do oral or anal sex count what about

725
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.880
non-genital forms of sexuality s
m kink or masturbation maybe just

726
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.680
how conventional and vanilla are the
expectations of this paranormal being

727
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.000
the idea of destigmatizing promiscuous
sex was particularly timely when it

728
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.200
follows hit theaters
media attention had just begun

729
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.640
addressing the slow growing popularity
of drugs like truvada

730
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.440
as a way to stop new hiv infections not
only does the drug reduce the likelihood

731
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.920
of a positive person passing on the
disease

732
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.240
in some cases making it impossible but
can also prevent the disease from taking

733
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.599
hold if taken by hiv negative people
thus reopening a part of queer sexual

734
00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:53.760
life
that had been more or less shut off

735
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.680
since the 1980s but anyone who mentioned
that they were using the drug commonly

736
00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.640
known as prep
immediately found themselves being

737
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.599
slut-shamed
many doctors could be judgmental of

738
00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:07.200
patients asking for
the once a day pill thrusting their

739
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.319
moral opinions on a medical issue
and so for some time many people in the

740
00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:16.640
gay community refuse to ask their
doctors for a prescription

741
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.520
shaming people for wanting to add an
extra layer of safety to their sex life

742
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.359
prep is much more common now resulting
in transmission rates of the hiv virus

743
00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:29.040
dropping dramatically
but for a time right around the release

744
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.720
of it follows
the shame of being seen as promiscuous

745
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.720
by doctors or friends
stopped a lot of people from getting the

746
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.800
new little blue pill
until then anything but monogamy even

747
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.480
with a condom
was looked at as a risky dangerous and

748
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.079
irresponsible behavior in much of the
queer community

749
00:52:48.079 --> 00:52:52.160
it follows appeared at a historical
moment when a hetero turned homo

750
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.960
normative model of monogamy
was upheld as law of the land while a

751
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.200
countervailing trend saw the partial
overcoming of long-time anxieties about

752
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.079
the most infamously fatal of sex-born
diseases

753
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:08.160
opening fresh possibilities for sexual
autonomy the film may not have been

754
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.359
deliberately intended as a
socio-political commentary on such

755
00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:14.160
shifts
indeed david robert mitchell the film's

756
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.520
writer director left the monster's
motives and weaknesses

757
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.880
nightmarishly unexplained and open to
interpretation

758
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.440
but the place of queerness as a sort of
structuring absence within the film

759
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.800
an unnamed but perpetually haunting
presence

760
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.480
still speaks to a queer audience but
just like how prep

761
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.599
has not completely disposed of hiv the
monster in it follows is similarly

762
00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:40.800
relentless
following a traumatic confrontation that

763
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.839
ends with jay agreeing
to pass the curse along to a boy who's

764
00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:48.720
had a crush on her since childhood
the apparently monogamous couple walk

765
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.240
hand in hand down a quiet suburban
street

766
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.610
unaware that behind them
it follows

767
00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:02.409
[Music]

768
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.400
not all horror movies deal with the
supernatural

769
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.079
some are more than happy to terrify you
with what you know best

770
00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:13.920
your friends your family your home
turning something mundane

771
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.400
into something truly terrifying bringing
horror to a place that it never should

772
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.880
have been
that's something that horror expert wes

773
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.280
craven did all too well
by making the violent killer of a film

774
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.480
someone you would have usually
sympathized with in the last house on

775
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.079
the left
perverting the relative safety of dreams

776
00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:35.920
with a nightmare on elm street
blurring the lines between horror and

777
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.839
real life with his new nightmare
and then bringing horror to the safest

778
00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:44.960
of all places in clinton america
the suburbs with scream written by

779
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.839
outgay screenwriter kevin williamson
scream tells the tale of sydney prescott

780
00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:53.839
who a year after her mother's murder is
having those old wombs figuratively and

781
00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:56.319
literally reopened
but the queerness of the film has

782
00:54:56.319 --> 00:55:02.240
nothing to do with sydney or her mother
but with the killers billy and stu

783
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.319
as well as the uncomfortable social
changes toward a more lgbt accepting

784
00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:11.599
society in the late 1990s
in terms as resonant as they were phobic

785
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:15.440
scream was a cry of despair
over an apparent immorality in the

786
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:20.040
millennial or late gen x youth
especially in the male population the

787
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.640
homoeroticism of the billy stew
relationship

788
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.559
which the film develops into an all but
explicit queer love affair

789
00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:31.920
shows both the unpredictable anarchic
bewildering behavior of the generation

790
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.160
and the shifts in male gender roles
synonymous with it

791
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.160
scream redeploys the long-standing
american tradition of a homoerotic bond

792
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.480
between a pair of young male killers
the foundation of the tradition is the

793
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.480
infamous leopoldon loeb case
these wealthy young men were university

794
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.040
of chicago students who murdered the
fourteen-year-old bobby franks in 1924

795
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.720
both were sentenced to life in prison
with one of them being murdered by

796
00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.520
another inmate shortly after sentencing
this case generated several fictional

797
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.720
treatments including hitchcock's 1948
film rope

798
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.920
which i covered in monsters in the
closet these killers considered

799
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.839
themselves to be nietzschean supermen
using their superior intellect as

800
00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:16.799
justification for their thrill killing
billy and stu however have no such lofty

801
00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:20.720
philosophical ambitions
their motivations are family and romance

802
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.079
driven
billy claims to be avenging himself for

803
00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:27.280
sydney's mother's crime of destroying
his family

804
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.319
and stu seemingly is just doing it for
billy

805
00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:34.960
scream also offers contrasting portraits
of masculinity but only in order to

806
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.839
intensify
its vision of an increasing cultural

807
00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:41.040
depravity
perhaps the first touch that links the

808
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.000
killers to queerdom is ghostface's first
appearance to

809
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.359
sydney he tries to trick her into
believing that he's

810
00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:52.240
on her front porch the killer then jumps
out of her closet instead

811
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.559
there's also the image of sydney's open
closet door protecting her from harm

812
00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:59.920
i might be reaching here but it's not
hard to read that as

813
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.000
it's better to have your closet door
open than closed

814
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.480
skeet ulrich's performance as billy and
especially matthew lillards as stu

815
00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:13.599
deepened the queer resonance that stand
forever on a knife's edge of obviousness

816
00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:17.440
ulrich's bloody intensity and perpetual
white t-shirt clearly evoke

817
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.079
james dean and rebel without a cause the
intense look in his eyes either sad or

818
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:25.200
cunning
keeps the audience as off-balance to his

819
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.160
identity
as it does sydney but when he does

820
00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.240
reveal his murderous identity the facade
dissolves entirely and he passes through

821
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.240
intensity into truly frightening
the dark underbelly of his pristine

822
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.720
all-american geniality
lillard stew meanwhile is notable for

823
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.720
his gender bending potential
he uses his basketball player height

824
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.280
rubbery face and excessive emotionalism
to create a memorably frantic character

825
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.119
that would shock no one if he suddenly
appeared in full drag

826
00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:57.200
in one scene set in the video store
where randy of movie geek works

827
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.040
randy theorizes about billy's possible
identity as the killer

828
00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.160
in perhaps the most homoerotic moment in
the film

829
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:09.359
billy suddenly swings upon randy
challenging him

830
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:16.079
how do we know you're not the killer huh
huh hi billy maybe your movie freaked

831
00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:18.559
mine lost it's reality button you ever
think of that

832
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:22.000
as billy gets in randy's face stu comes
up from behind him

833
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.680
in a shockingly intimate almost
threesome

834
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.520
what has been called femmephobia
intersects here with homophobia

835
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.960
as the killer's increasingly inept
performance of gender mirrors their

836
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.440
ultimately inept attempt
to craft the perfect murder plot craven

837
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.960
makes the interesting choice to stage
the big revelation scene

838
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.839
at the climax of the film in the kitchen
the mama's boy killers reveal the

839
00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:49.760
nefarious identities within the domestic
space most closely associated with the

840
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.400
mother
earlier in the film billy and sydney

841
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:58.799
have sex after she announces that
if life is one big movie genre her pick

842
00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:04.079
is porn ghostface suddenly appears
right after they've finished and

843
00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:07.920
seemingly stabs billy to death
one can assume that he's been watching

844
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.359
them do the deed the entire time
of course we soon learn that this is

845
00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:14.720
only a ruse to distract sydney from
billy's real identity as one of the

846
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.359
killers
billy staggers back to life in his

847
00:59:17.359 --> 00:59:20.880
seemingly blood-drenched t-shirt
getting possession of the gun sydney had

848
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.119
been wielding billy shoots randy and
then

849
00:59:23.119 --> 00:59:27.200
dabs a finger in his blood and brings it
up to his lips

850
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.200
there's also the negative oedipus
complex homosexuality is the chief

851
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:35.280
aspect of it
in a footnote added in 1910 to his 1905

852
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.119
three essays on the theory of
sexuality sigmund freud conjecture's

853
00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:43.119
homosexual identity emerges from an
identification with the mother

854
00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:46.799
and billy is nothing if not obsessed
with his mother

855
00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:50.880
while many have read freud's theory as
homophobic it would likely be fairer to

856
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.079
say that it's been put to homophobic use
in american psychiatry

857
00:59:54.079 --> 00:59:58.000
which historically used it to
pathologize homosexuality as an arrested

858
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.760
development
what scream makes vividly clear is the

859
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.960
cultural reception of narcissistic
mother identified desire the killers and

860
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.240
scream are monstrous not only because
they kill

861
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.079
but because their desire proceeds from
identification with the mother what

862
01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:17.359
complicates or is
left deliberately unresolved by the

863
01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:22.000
filmmakers is the specific nature of the
boy's relationship with each other

864
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.559
stu's desire is left especially unclear
but in some ways it is his desire that

865
01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:31.599
more clearly has a basis
in the homoerotic stu has a girlfriend

866
01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:36.240
dispatched via garage door but his chief
affection is directed toward billy

867
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.480
to whom he's quite clearly devoted what
is most significant about stu's

868
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.160
relationship with billy are the ways in
which billy's desire becomes

869
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.640
stu's desires becoming an easy analog
for the feeling of many gay teenage boys

870
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.640
who will do anything
play any sport see any movie take any

871
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.440
drug
in a desperate attempt to connect with

872
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.040
their male crushes
a queer reading becomes more obvious at

873
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.720
least to me when the pair of killers
decide they need to stab each other in

874
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.240
order to frame sydney for the killings
penetrating one another to show their

875
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.680
devotion replicating the pain
of virginal anal sex scream

876
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.440
with its queer coding delicious dialogue
and willingness to reach

877
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.640
into camp territory when necessary has
become a classic slasher among the queer

878
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.440
community
while we watch it as a smart send up of

879
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.880
the genre which was well and dead in
1996

880
01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.079
many people of the more hetero
persuasion see the film a bit

881
01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:33.760
differently
it's the horror of danger coming to the

882
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.440
suburbs
a place of safety being perverted where

883
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.599
nice white families fled to
in order to escape the poor black and

884
01:01:41.599 --> 01:01:44.240
queer horrors that filled the city
streets

885
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.480
and in scream the queer horror
penetrated that safety it also tore

886
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.599
apart the idea of the ideal american
family

887
01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:56.960
billy's family was torn asunder when
sydney's mother had an affair with his

888
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.160
father
leading to a divorce and his mother

889
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.119
leaving town
and so he took sydney's mother away from

890
01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:07.599
her too the fragility of the straight
nuclear family coming to a bloody end

891
01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:12.799
just as the new millennium dawned
showing us all that families though a

892
01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:21.839
nice idea
can lead to unexpected horrors

893
01:02:25.839 --> 01:02:30.160
in 2017 a perhaps unlikely queer icon
emerged in the form of a black and white

894
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.480
cartoon character from australia
with sharp teeth theatrical makeup and a

895
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.520
top hat
this cultural phenomenon began with the

896
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.200
2016 tumblr thread initiated by online
user

897
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.160
e instagram who declared mr babadook the
titular monster from jennifer kent's

898
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.119
2014 horror film to be fearlessly and
proudly gay

899
01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:56.240
in his initial post instagram wonders
whenever someone says that the babadook

900
01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.880
isn't openly gay it's like
did you even watch the movie sparking

901
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.200
what participants called a baba
discourse

902
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.720
scores of others weighed in on the
tumblr thread with one user proclaiming

903
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.680
the b
in lgbt stands for babadook the next

904
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.440
several months saw the proliferation
of queer babadook memes and multiple

905
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.799
representations of the babudooka 2017
pride festivals

906
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:21.520
across the united states the babadook
has emerged as a queer icon

907
01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.880
because he can be read as having
characteristics associated with cultural

908
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.839
gayness
for example he wears dramatic costuming

909
01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:31.920
that recalls the theatricality of drag
and he struggles against a rather

910
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.559
literally closeted existence
in which many disavow or reject him

911
01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:39.280
while references to these
characteristics abound in the typically

912
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.480
humorous and ironic examples of the
character's queerness

913
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.720
this monster and the film from which he
emerges call for critical attention to

914
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.720
normative constructions of the family
the hegemony of reproductive

915
01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.559
heterosexuality
and the implications of both for the

916
01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:58.640
lives of women
that is the babadook invites queer

917
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.680
appropriation because
he represents the horrors of

918
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.880
heteronormative family life
and gender politics while socially

919
01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.799
conservative rhetoric frequently casts
the family as a site of innocence

920
01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:13.920
imperiled by outside
forces the babadook constructs the

921
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.400
family as a site that is too often
constituted

922
01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.480
by multiple forms of systemic physical
and emotional violence

923
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.000
narratively the babadook written and
directed by jennifer kent is the story

924
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.520
of emilia
a single mother and her only son samuel

925
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.039
on the day her son would be born amelia
and her husband oscar have a car

926
01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:33.680
accident
on the way to the hospital and oscar

927
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.359
dies having given up her career as a
writer to earn a living as a nursing

928
01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:41.039
home attendant
emilia has been samuel's only caregiver

929
01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:43.760
an isolating experience exasperated by
both

930
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.480
other people's uneasiness with her grief
and by their ableist discomfort with

931
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.680
samuel's differences
emilia's ability to care for her son

932
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.000
becomes severely constrained when she
decides

933
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.839
she must remove him from his school
which seems unwilling or unable to

934
01:04:57.839 --> 01:05:02.000
accommodate his needs
at the same time samuel becomes fixated

935
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.839
on an invisible monster that he warns
lives in their house

936
01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:09.680
when a mysterious and violent children's
book appears amelia begins to fear that

937
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.559
the monster is not a figment of samuel's
imagination

938
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:16.640
and soon she and her home are tormented
by a boogeyman

939
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.720
known as the babadook who lives under
her child's bed

940
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:25.119
and in his closet as anxiety
sleeplessness and trauma take a toll on

941
01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:28.400
amelia
she first directs her anger at samuel

942
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.599
becoming violent
before eventually confronting the

943
01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:34.480
babadook
she realizes she can never fully rid

944
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.000
their lives of the monster that now
resides in their home

945
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.359
she determines to make relative peace
with it

946
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:45.440
locking it in their basement but keeping
it well fed and alive

947
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.359
as illustrated by a line in the
babadook's book the more you deny the

948
01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:52.559
stronger i
get the monster operates as a signifier

949
01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:56.880
of emilia's grief over oscar's death
the more she represses this trauma the

950
01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.240
more power it has to return and disrupt
her life

951
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.240
this allegory is not however the only
one at work within the babadook

952
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.039
amelia appears as a 21st century sister
of rosemary from rosemary's baby

953
01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:12.079
as the babadook crosses the horror
formula of

954
01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:16.319
other as villain with the female gothic
interest in gendered experience and

955
01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:18.720
victimhood
transforming the beleaguered female

956
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.720
protagonist herself into a monster
backing up the idea that the greatest

957
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.319
monsters do not come from without or
from within

958
01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:29.599
that perhaps the monsters in
heteronormative suburbia

959
01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:33.119
did not come from the outside from
cities

960
01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:36.720
but that they've been there all along
and how does one become a suburban

961
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.640
monster
by trying to fit in emilia is struggling

962
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.280
financially
and the depiction of the life she leads

963
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.960
with her son shows the economic
vulnerability of single-parent families

964
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.079
especially single mothers
her stress to keep everything running

965
01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:53.200
smoothly to try for normal
is what drives her to become the

966
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.079
maternal monster that strikes out at her
own son

967
01:06:56.079 --> 01:07:00.799
the babadook on the other hand
ostensibly coded queer does no actual

968
01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:05.119
harm to amelia or samuel
it is just the fear of him that causes

969
01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:11.119
harm it is the societal pressure of the
heteronormative world that causes harm

970
01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:15.359
amelia's paranoia the sense of being
watched originates in the way her public

971
01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:19.200
life is dominated by and
private life intruded upon by

972
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.480
institutional and bureaucratic forces
that scrutinize her

973
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.640
and especially her parenting first the
representatives of the school system

974
01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.000
that had failed samuel
and then the community service

975
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.599
representatives that take over
then there are the disturbing encounters

976
01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:38.240
with others that she hopes will help her
the doctor who judges her when she

977
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.359
requests sleeping pills to make samuel
sleep

978
01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:45.520
so that she herself can sleep and the
desk sergeant in the police station who

979
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.480
when
amelia attempts to report a stalker

980
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.839
looks back at her with the strange pale
eyes of the storybook monster both

981
01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:57.520
encounters show historically strained
relations between institutional

982
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.000
authorities and women under threat
society is actively and passively

983
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.960
harming her
while the queer monster remains mostly

984
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.160
benign
in acknowledgment of these real everyday

985
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.760
social pressures on emilia the forum
taken by the babadook references the

986
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.920
familiar source of her madness
and monstrosity there are elements of

987
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.600
samuel as the babadook's garb recalls
the little boy's homemade magician's

988
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.640
costume
while the threat of its mouth in the

989
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.480
pop-up book offers a horror movie
version of samuel's screams for

990
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.839
attention
and then there's the house a victorian

991
01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:35.279
style house that kent had constructed
specifically for this film

992
01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:39.279
and that operates as a character in its
own right specifically of note

993
01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.880
are the ways that the home in the film
diverges from both idealized

994
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.440
constructions of the home
and the role of the home within the

995
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.759
horror movie genre the signifier of the
home often functions as an allegory for

996
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:53.920
heteronormative sexist ablest and
classist figurations of family

997
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.400
how homeownership is often considered a
milestone for success and stability for

998
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.799
those a part of or
wishing to be a part of the

999
01:09:00.799 --> 01:09:05.040
heteronormative masses how often the
home acts as a site for the production

1000
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.719
and regulation of bodies that are
normatively gendered and sexed

1001
01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:11.839
and how consistently the culture of
suburban home life and

1002
01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:16.239
typical design practices presume that a
house's inhabitants will all be fully

1003
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:19.120
abled
thereby rendering them inaccessible to

1004
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.400
those who are not
physically ideal the single-family home

1005
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.400
acting as a sort of
moated castle protecting the inhabitants

1006
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.600
from the working poor they might
otherwise come across in an apartment

1007
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.359
building
or the infirm in a nursing home or the

1008
01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.880
other races
or queers and select ghettoized areas

1009
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.600
but in the babadook those others
infiltrate the home and cause no harm

1010
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.960
threaten
yes but never act only the self causes

1011
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.719
harm
not the other the babadook's queerness

1012
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:52.640
lies in its subversion of the family
in its apparent danger to what is

1013
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.040
accepted by society
by only growing in power the more it is

1014
01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.159
denied
like a gaping wound that begins to

1015
01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:04.080
fester each time a person lies about
their sexuality

1016
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.679
every time someone pretends to be
someone they're not so that society will

1017
01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:10.480
accept them
and there's an odd draw to the black and

1018
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.320
white monster for queer people
outside the movie it was looked at as a

1019
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.800
joke like so many queer
icons initially are cher judy garland

1020
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.600
dolly parton
all looked at as over the top and worth

1021
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.800
nothing more than derision
and then they enter into a cultural

1022
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.000
permanence once they're adopted by the
queer community

1023
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.480
someone was like how could the babadook
become a gay film

1024
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.840
and the answer was readily available
said karen thompson

1025
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.840
an associate professor of gender studies
in english at usc

1026
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.199
he lives in a basement he's weird and
flamboyant

1027
01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:46.239
he's living adjacently to a single
mother in this kind of

1028
01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:50.640
queer kinship structure he exists in a
half-acknowledged state by the other

1029
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.679
people in his house
the family is afraid of what he is but

1030
01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:58.320
finds a way to accept him over time
for many lgbt people that's what it

1031
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.400
feels like to be
in your own family sometimes naturally

1032
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.920
there are counter arguments
the babadook never says he's gay he

1033
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.400
never displays physical attraction to
another person

1034
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.600
but historically fictional characters
haven't needed to say

1035
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.000
i am gay out loud to be read as queer
or to become queer icons so many lgbt

1036
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.040
people have been barred from seeing
themselves represented in popular

1037
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.600
culture
so we've had to project ourselves into

1038
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.120
so many of these figures thongson said
there are ways to read into the

1039
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.080
character itself
and the structure of how this ostensibly

1040
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.000
monstrous thing
becomes incorporated ultimately into a

1041
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.840
family
but is the babadook gay

1042
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.719
when asked about this in 2019 director
jennifer kent simply replied

1043
01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:46.000
of course sometimes it's just that
simple

1044
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.920
sometimes the monster the queer can be
accepted

1045
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:57.840
sometimes suburbia isn't so bad
but sometimes it

1046
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:09.840
can be a nightmare
[Music]

1047
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.880
it by stephen king was published in 1986
and has made a lasting cultural

1048
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.239
impression
the novel inspired a mini-series two

1049
01:12:18.239 --> 01:12:22.000
movies and ruined clowns for generations
of children

1050
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.719
and adults frankly pennywise transforms
into things that will scare people the

1051
01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.520
most
and stephen king used the 1950s setting

1052
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.920
to pay tribute to classic movie monsters
since its release the novel has inspired

1053
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.600
fans to discuss its themes allegories
and underlying subtext

1054
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.800
a common discussion is the
interpretation that richie tozier and

1055
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.199
eddie kasprak had strong repressed gay
feelings for one another

1056
01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:49.360
the most recent adaptation it chapter 2
directed by andy musgetty

1057
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.960
dedicates an entire subplot to the
romance between richie and eddie

1058
01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.320
there have been protests that the
character's change in sexuality comes

1059
01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.120
out of nowhere but
that's not so quite cut and dry when

1060
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.679
eddie first encounters pennywise the
titular it

1061
01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:07.360
he's at a place known to attract hobos
and drifters

1062
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.880
it takes the form of a hobo who's
stricken with disease

1063
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.880
it uses a leper to frighten eddie
instead of your typical horror movie

1064
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.520
monster
one of these fellows had crawled out

1065
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.560
from under the porch of the house at 29
nybolt street one day and had offered to

1066
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.640
give eddie a [Â __Â ] for a quarter
eddie had backed away his skin like ice

1067
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.280
his mouth as dry as lint balls
one of the hobo's nostrils had been

1068
01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:38.800
eaten away you could look right into the
red scabby channel

1069
01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.600
i i don't have a quarter eddie said
backing toward his bike

1070
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.000
do it for a dime the hobo croaked coming
toward him

1071
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.040
he was wearing old green flannel pants
yellow

1072
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:57.280
puke was stiffening across the lap
he unzipped his fly and reached inside

1073
01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.920
he was trying to grin his nose was a red
horror

1074
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.159
uh i don't have a dime either eddie said
and suddenly thought oh my god he's got

1075
01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:12.159
leprosy
if he touches me i'll catch it too his

1076
01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:16.719
control snapped and he ran
he heard the hobo break into a shuffling

1077
01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:21.280
run behind him
his old string tied shoes slapping and

1078
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.600
flapping across the riotous lawn of the
empty saltbox house

1079
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.159
eddie's physical manifestation of fear
has symbolic meaning that is linked to

1080
01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:33.760
his abusive upbringing
eddie sees it as a leper because his

1081
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.760
mother's insistence that he is sickly
and delicate

1082
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.640
has made him afraid of disease
eddie is horrified of the leper's

1083
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.880
appearance but the real terror
doesn't set in until he realizes that he

1084
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.280
could catch its illness
the leper uses the offer of sexual

1085
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.960
favors to scare him
nowhere else in the story does pennywise

1086
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.040
threaten the children with sexual
assault

1087
01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.280
so its decision to do so here
is an important distinction this

1088
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.560
metaphor is significant
because the leper is a sickly diseased

1089
01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.600
man offering oral sex to eddie and
its combination of these things shows us

1090
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.120
a deep
fear eddie has unknown even to himself

1091
01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.640
eddie's afraid of doing sexual things
with men because he believes he will get

1092
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.880
a disease and die
its use of the leper as a manifestation

1093
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.239
of eddie's fear
is our first clue that eddie is

1094
01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:30.719
queer-coded
because he is groomed to fear disease

1095
01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:33.840
and sickness
he fears his own homosexuality and views

1096
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.199
it as something that could kill him
though this section of the book takes

1097
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.880
place in the 1950s the book itself was
published in the chaotic midst of the

1098
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.880
aids crisis
when gay sex really could lead to a

1099
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.320
disease and death
we also get some interesting religious

1100
01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.560
imagery as eddie thinks back to the root
of his religious fear

1101
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.000
he's quick to dismiss religious rules as
stupid but stops himself

1102
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
as he remembers he takes religion
seriously enough

1103
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.239
to be afraid of it it's interesting that
eddie fears going to hell even though

1104
01:16:06.239 --> 01:16:10.880
he's never done anything to warrant it
reading eddie's inner turmoil as the

1105
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.560
result of suppressed homosexual feelings
it makes sense for eddie to wonder about

1106
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.840
going to hell because of who he is
rather than something he's done another

1107
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.600
coded aspect of eddie's hidden sexuality
is how he interacts with the other

1108
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.120
losers
in one scene stephen king singles out

1109
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.520
eddie as being
delighted by bill we get an explanation

1110
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.520
for eddie's unmatched joy
when eddie tries to imitate bill

1111
01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.120
modelling himself after the boy in order
to come across as brave

1112
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.280
eddie idolizes bill and his love is
rooted in that admiration

1113
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.560
there are many references to eddie
having hero worship for bill or seeming

1114
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.600
to love bill more than the other losers
this is disguised as eddie simply

1115
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.280
idolizing bill
but it reads much clearer as an

1116
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.960
unrequited crush on him
with eddie simply not knowing how to

1117
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.679
categorize it
another member of the losers club that

1118
01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:07.440
hits home with queer readers is richie
a character many people even straight

1119
01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.679
readers have interpreted
as being bisexual he like most of the

1120
01:17:11.679 --> 01:17:14.800
boys in the group
has at least a bit of a crush on beverly

1121
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.000
the lone girl
but also a clear connection with eddie

1122
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.360
as well
not just in friendship or love but in

1123
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.640
trauma
childhood trauma looms under the skin of

1124
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.880
the losers club well
into adulthood as it chapter 2 explores

1125
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.400
the reunion of the crew
in their hometown for most of the

1126
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.640
children their trauma existed on the
surface

1127
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.560
of the first it film eddie's overbearing
mother

1128
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.640
beverly's father verbally abusing her
and sexually taunting her as she begins

1129
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.840
to grow into her adult body
mike seeing his parents burned alive six

1130
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.320
out of the seven losers left dairy as
soon as they were old enough

1131
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.040
leaving allowed them to forget the
trauma but leaving didn't remove it

1132
01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.800
just tucked it away out of sight
where it could seep out and impact their

1133
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.960
life
later on both beverly and eddie married

1134
01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.080
a version of their abusive parents
bill now a writer can't think of a happy

1135
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.800
ending
ever since his little brother georgie

1136
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.719
was murdered by pennywise
stanley is so terrorized by his

1137
01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:23.520
childhood torment that he kills himself
when he finds out that it has returned

1138
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.000
like every person on the planet the
losers remain trapped in their trauma

1139
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.760
they've just found new ways to cope
richie ended up telling jokes

1140
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:39.199
and becoming rich and successful but
always alone throughout it chapter 2 it

1141
01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:42.000
becomes clear
that richie is a closeted gay man in

1142
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.520
love with eddie
mostly this revelation becomes clear

1143
01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.719
through two scenes
the first is a flashback of richie

1144
01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:51.600
hanging out at an arcade the same summer
of the losers

1145
01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.760
defeated pennywise see the movies take
place bit further ahead of time than the

1146
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.000
book
he plays street fighter with a boy he's

1147
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.440
had a crush on
when the kid says he has to go richie

1148
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.679
offers to pay for the next round
unfortunately his crush's cousin henry

1149
01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:10.320
bowers
lives to torment richie and his friends

1150
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.480
now face to face with a stab happy bully
and surrounded by the judging eyes of

1151
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.440
his peers
richie's sexuality and therefore

1152
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.760
masculinity is challenged by his crush
richie runs out of the arcade and seeks

1153
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.600
refuge in a public park
before him stands the symbol of

1154
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.040
masculinity a giant ax swinging paul
bunyan looming

1155
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.000
20 feet high in his flannel and denim
he's a stark contrast to richie's blue

1156
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.560
and pink swirled button-up shirt
the american folk hero instantly becomes

1157
01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.480
a threat with shredded teeth
the second scene that reveals ritchie is

1158
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.600
queer doesn't happen until eddie dies
everyone is sad but richie is beside

1159
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.640
himself
so overcome with emotion that he has to

1160
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.920
be hauled out of the sewer by his
friends

1161
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.920
adult ritchie doesn't seem to fit into a
2019 narrative

1162
01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.480
not everyone can come out in america but
richie works as a comedian in los

1163
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.560
angeles even if he chose to keep his
sexuality close to the vest

1164
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.440
the idea that gay marriage and giant
pride parades could miss a white man

1165
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.159
working in hollywood doesn't make sense
if it did highlighting that fact would

1166
01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:20.960
be vital to understanding the character
the murky nature of richie's queer

1167
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.920
identity feels
like a letdown the second chapter of it

1168
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.280
attempts to reveal the way
dormant childhood trauma springs forth

1169
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.960
in adulthood
anything buried will eventually rise to

1170
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.600
the surface
except for richie's sexuality apparently

1171
01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.600
the queer community is still struggling
to be seen in cinema as more than tragic

1172
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.639
romances or gay best friends
the balance of the identity

1173
01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:48.800
representation within the losers club
offered an awesome opportunity to detail

1174
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.679
the effects of the past 30 years on the
most privileged members of the community

1175
01:20:53.679 --> 01:21:00.480
but in the film richie a well-off
white masculine gay man

1176
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:04.000
never even says that he's gay out loud
not everything in it

1177
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.159
is coding though very early on in the
story we are shown the brutal gay

1178
01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:13.440
bashing and violent murder
of adrian mellon a murder so heinous

1179
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.080
it wakes the titular it from its
decades-long slumber

1180
01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.239
king's language is harsh with characters
using a vast array of homophobic slurs

1181
01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:25.679
in those early pages
but those characters using them even the

1182
01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:30.480
police are not celebrated
the author is very clearly judging them

1183
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.600
and it's this
horrible violence so soon into the book

1184
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.600
that shows the darkness and hate
lurking under the surface of small town

1185
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.400
america
it is the hate that's unnatural the hate

1186
01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.159
that is evil not being queer
when we get into the head of don hagerty

1187
01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:53.040
adrian's boyfriend
and the author lets the reader know him

1188
01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:00.000
he's sympathetic he's smart and loving
he also sees the town for what it is

1189
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.360
sees its evil clearly and wants to leave
it

1190
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.080
though the characters in the book don't
empathize with him for having his

1191
01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.679
boyfriend killed in front of him
the author does he shows the gay

1192
01:22:11.679 --> 01:22:14.800
character as human

1193
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.880
in the midst of reagan america the
world's best-selling author

1194
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:25.120
was sending a very blunt message
stephen king thought gay people should

1195
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.760
be able to date
and hold hands and live their lives

1196
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.320
stephen king did not think gay people
should be tortured or killed

1197
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.719
he thought that those who would torture
or kill gay people were in the service

1198
01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:43.040
of evil
as were those who would tolerate it or

1199
01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.960
look away
the victims of homophobia did not

1200
01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.080
deserve to be victims
homophobia stephen king seemed to say is

1201
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:57.280
not the natural way of the world
it is a monstrous thing and those who

1202
01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.199
practice it
are a part of the monster like the

1203
01:23:01.199 --> 01:23:06.000
babadook
hellraiser jennifer's body the craft and

1204
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.080
king's own carry
the queer is not the monster

1205
01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:20.239
something else is gay men
lesbian women bisexual people

1206
01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:26.239
transgender people everyone under the
queer umbrella

1207
01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:35.840
we are not the monsters you
are not the monster

1208
01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:41.600
but the society that demonizes you that
others you

1209
01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:49.840
that is the monster

1210
01:23:52.680 --> 01:24:43.810
