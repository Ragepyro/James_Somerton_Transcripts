Squarespace I want to be absolutely

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.320
clear upfront so that you can be very
assured where my intentions are going

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.559
forward I do not dislike any of the
media that we're talking about in this

4
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.119
video in fact I loved most of it on the
page and the screen I'm not coming for

5
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.400
any of the creators this time but we do
need to talk about this because there is

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.480
clearly an issue here and it's becoming
a problem but the issue doesn't really

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.040
have a clear Target to blame
so let's hit the ground running and talk

contentious relationship is the stuff of
social media Legend the simmering

21
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.000
animosity between them reaches its
Crescendo when a relatively minor

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.439
misunderstanding leads to them swimming
and wedding cake providing juicy content

23
00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.360
for the eager tabloids on both sides of
the pond the repercussions are immediate

ill timed threatening to put a dent in
her electoral armor damage control is of

26
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.119
the essence to smooth out ruffled
feathers and plate the media's appetite

27
00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.520
for Scandal Alex and Henry are thrust
into a meticulously orchestrated PR

28
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.399
campaign
this facade aimed at showcasing their

29
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.960
renewed friendship has them attending
events posing for pictures and offering

30
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.720
sound bites about their brotherly Bond
what three words would I use to describe

31
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.280
Henry white blonde and British during
one such contrived rendevu after a

32
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.360
security breach lands them both locked
in a cramped broom closet Alex's guard

33
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.640
crumbles he divulges the root of his
resentment stemming from a slate he felt

34
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.760
from Henry during one of his initial
forays into the international stage this

35
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.840
heartfelt confession laced with
vulnerability moves Henry recognizing

36
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.760
the weight of the misunderstanding he
extends a genuine gesture of

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.040
reconciliation late night texts replace
tur exchanges humor replaces hostility

38
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.360
and slowly they start to build a bond
peppered with light-hearted Jabs and

39
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.480
shared inside jokes however
relationships are rarely linear at the

40
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.239
extravagant New Year celebration hosted
by Alex emotions bubble to the surface

41
00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.480
when the clock strikes midnight a
buoyant Alex loses loses himself in the

42
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.080
festivities this does not sit well with
the Prince Henry's sudden and

43
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.720
unexplained departure hints at unspoken
sentiments driven by an overwhelming

44
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.560
fear of maybe losing Henry Alex seeks
him out in the Serene White House

45
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.360
Gardens confusion leads to a kiss from
the prince who like any man then spends

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.280
the next several weeks ignoring Alex's
texts and phone calls a normal gay

Henry and the pair end up hooking up the
PA enter into a Friends with Benefits

49
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.080
relationship although they keep their
involvement secret Duty and

50
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.760
responsibilities however have their own
demands the Electoral Battlefield

51
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.879
beckons and Alex finds himself in Texas
championing his mother's campaign

52
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.159
because this is a romantic fantasy the
idea of Texas voting for a Democratic

53
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.640
president is actually possible he later
travels to Brooklyn to speak at the

54
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.040
Democratic National Convention where
Henry unexpectedly visits him this leads

55
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.560
to these friends with benefits becoming
something closer cler than just friends

56
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.879
Alex even comes out to his mother as
bisexual she's very supportive maybe

57
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.360
even too supportive when she starts
recommending that he go on prep but

58
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.040
advises him to think about his
relationship carefully a public

59
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.160
relationship between the first son and
the prince of England could change their

60
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.919
lives forever their story however is far
from a fairy tale ending Henry visits

61
00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.639
Alex at the scene at Claremont Vacation
House near Austin Texas out on the lake

62
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.520
just when Alex is on the cusp of sharing
his deepest feelings with with Henry the

63
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.320
panicked Prince throws himself into the
lake and soon leaves escaping to England

64
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.639
but love with its tenacity Spurs Alex on
he pursues Henry across the ocean

65
00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.919
seeking answers drenched from the
English rain Alex demands to know why

66
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.960
Henry has basically abandoned him Henry
admits that he loves Alex just as Alex

67
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.600
loves him but explains that his Royal
position makes a gay relationship

68
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.840
impossible for him but Alex with those
eyelashes of his manages to convince

69
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.440
Henry that their relationship is worth
fighting for and the the two reconcile

70
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.400
and commit to being together yet Destiny
has more challenges waiting in the wings

71
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.919
their intimate emails and texts a window
to their evolving Love Story are

72
00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.080
maliciously exposed by a spurned x of
Alex's creating a media melstrom Alex

73
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.919
uses this as an opportunity to come out
publicly and own his sexuality and his

74
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.039
love for Henry giving a moving speech
that makes him the figurehead for queer

75
00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.759
America but things don't go so well for
Henry whose family has all but

76
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.919
sequestered him away from the public at
large but thanks to some deaf

77
00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.000
maneuvering on the part of allies on
both sides Alex and Henry reunite in

78
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.680
London and prepare to confront the king
of England about Henry being allowed to

79
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.520
be his own man a tur confrontation
follows but is interrupted by the sounds

80
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520
in the streets the public have come to
support Henry despite what his family

81
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.240
may want and going against the wishes of
the crown Henry chooses Alex the climax

82
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.039
of the story coincides with the US
elections polls are tight and Alex's

83
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.639
family is preparing for bad news the
only thing keeping Alex together is is

84
00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.400
Henry by his side as his mother prepares
a concession speech news comes from

might read like The Ultimate wh if

109
00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:57.280
scenario but strip away the
international diplomacy and Royal

110
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.720
trappings and you got yourself a pretty
straightforward romance two guys falling

111
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.080
for each other when they least expect it
groundbreaking now if you're familiar

112
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.759
with the romance genre you'll know that
it's not exactly bursting at the seams

113
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:14.720
with gay love stories that don't take a
tragic turn and mainstream romcoms well

114
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.520
they've historically stuck to the script
of snowflakes and sanitized kisses with

115
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.720
the steamier stuff being left implied if
it's acknowledged at all explicitly

116
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.000
sexual gay romcoms are like unicorns
mythically rare and to some potentially

117
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.720
unsettling in this narrative Alex and
Henry's all consuming infatuation

118
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.599
anchors the plot they're the kind of
into to deep that has them gambling

119
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:38.240
everything on a chance at happiness and
sure with Alex's mom in full campaign

120
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.240
mode and Henry sporting a crown usually
metaphorically their romance isn't

121
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.399
exactly publicity friendly but the
fireworks happen offstage their text

122
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:51.120
messages a master class in building
sexual tension and they together moments

123
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.320
well let's just say they're explosive in
the clutcher pearls kind of way

124
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.120
especially in the book they make up for
lost time as it were the story kind of

125
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.000
saunters into this this Lial space it's
not pure handholding puppy love like in

126
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.399
heartstopper but it's also not quite at
the level of pay-per-view eroticism that

127
00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:11.440
you'd find an elite it's sweet sure
endearing even to the most cynical of us

128
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.440
but it also packs enough heat to make
you want to crack open a window my full

129
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.360
name is Henry George Edward James
Hanover Stewart

130
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.040
Fox and I thought Alexander Gabriel
Claremont Diaz was a

131
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.360
mouthful he
is and yeah it got heat of the not so

132
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.040
great kind uh we're talking about think
pieces from places like The Huffington

133
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.240
Post and the BBC getting their knickers
in a Twist over the movie's excessive

134
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.399
sexiness The
Twist some of these naysayers were gay

135
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:47.640
men it's a bit of a the call is coming
from inside of the house moment when

136
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.920
queer people themselves openly admit to
being comfortable watching straight sex

137
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.279
in movies but are turned away by the
sight of boys kissing especially due to

138
00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:59.079
how relatively tame red white and Royal
Blue's sex was compared to other game

139
00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:02.959
media released in recent memory the bulk
of criticism however was found on social

140
00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.079
media where straight people seemed to be
confused and shocked that gay men had

141
00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:12.480
sex at all the references and
the one particular sex scene which

142
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.680
seemed like a Rubik's Cube to some
straight viewers were too much for an

143
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.720
audience that had been raised on the
sexless gay best friend sidekick

144
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.560
character it's almost as if someone
asked do gay characters have sexual

145
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.120
encounters how do they do this when
they're both facing each other what kind

146
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.760
of Witchcraft is this as a result they
rushed to the internet first to

147
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.000
investigate how the missionary position
could possibly work with gays and then

148
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.760
to express their dissatisfaction with
the situation there's a strong

149
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.680
undercurrent of hypocrisy here
particularly as queer folk of literally

150
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.480
every shade of the rainbow are accused
of corrupting the youth never mind that

151
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.440
it was perfectly acceptable for
virtually every American Teen Movie to

152
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.760
focus with laser Precision on rooting
for teenagers to Bone each other the

153
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.120
American piie franchise owes its whole
success to this for which audiences

154
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.560
agree that the heterosexual events in
American Pi

155
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.040
are normal but when it's gay it's
sexualization echoing a sentiment

156
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.680
quietly expressed in culture straight is
normal and everything else that is

157
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.880
outside of normal must be scrutinized
for how it may corrupt the normal which

158
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.079
is the most irrational thought process
presented in this essay and I will note

159
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:17.720
just in case YouTube makes me cut the
footage of said scene the main sex scene

160
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.560
in red white and royal blue entirely
focuses on faces it's all about the

161
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.000
emotional intimacy between two people
and less about the raw sex which isn't

162
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.800
even raw by the way because they make a
point of using a condom which a lot of

163
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.399
gay viewers laughed at because we're in
the age of prep but two things one

164
00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:38.760
Prince Henry probably couldn't go on
prep without it causing a scandal and

165
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.519
two there are STDs other than HIV guys
this is why syphilis is resurging and

166
00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:48.600
why we're getting antibiotic resistant
strains of Gonorrhea now wrap it up in

167
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.240
any case according to what I've gathered
the majority of viewers who

168
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.440
were offended were heterosexual women
who were apparently exposed to gay

169
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.880
content for the first time in their
lives be a Heart Stopper which huge

170
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.959
props to Heart Stopper by the way for
opening people's minds to the concept

171
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:11.519
that boy kissing is all right but when
that's their only exposure I can

172
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:16.519
understand how legs up anal penetration
may leave them surprised however they

173
00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:21.639
were so taken aback that they criticized
the film for having an excessive amount

174
00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:26.959
of sexual content which once more is one
scene and in both a physical and

175
00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:30.519
figurative sense it's not quite as steem
me as the sex scene that took place

176
00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:33.320
between Rose and Jack and the car in
Titanic they were shut down online

177
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.480
pretty quickly by a huge swath of fans
made up mostly of women but to my

178
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.959
delightful surprise a lot of gay men as
well who told them to pipe down and

179
00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:45.680
accept that sex exists thank you but for
a few days this very very vocal minority

180
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.160
were making it seem like Alex and Henry
having sex in the most basic position

181
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.000
known to humankind while using a condom
and even to my recollection being under

182
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.040
the bed sheets was compared on a
onetoone basis as as the third day of a

183
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.839
meth orgy so why is it that they were
perfectly fine with Nick and Charlie

184
00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:07.279
kissing up a storm on heartstopper
writing fanfiction about it and creating

185
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:12.240
countless fan edits on Tik Tok but
basically formed a covenant the minute

186
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.680
Alex pushed Henry's knees up to his
chest I'd like to see the reaction

187
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.160
to
well any episode of que's folk now was

188
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.120
this just because they've never been
exposed to the idea of gay sex before

189
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.560
were they homophobic were they secret
prageru plants out to kill the movie

190
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.240
were they sex negative in general or
have we as a society simply conditioned

191
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:41.720
a large swath of the populace to think
of gays as completely nonsexual objects

192
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.959
something that plenty of people like
having around but keep at a distance

193
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:49.440
just far enough away to not have to know
too much about it they know that men

194
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.240
have sex with men and women have sex
with women but they're really I outb by

195
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.480
the idea of knowing the ins and outs and
tops and bottoms of it all good thing

196
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.160
Henry didn't eat any beans before the
scene or that could have brought up even

197
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.040
more uncomfortable questions the
controversy about the sex in red white

198
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.639
and royal blue while quickly suppressed
seems to paint an ill- fated Omen about

199
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:12.800
the condition of gay men and possibly by
extension all of queerness and the

200
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.880
ability to be open about sex lives
especially in the same comfort that

201
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.079
straight creators depict straight sex
through a latent process of judging

202
00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:26.480
gayness in media the straight audience
can pass a stamp of approval or condemn

203
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.759
certain media and in the process we can
perhaps perceive the hetero hegemony as

204
00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:36.880
dictating how or how not to be gay and
simply by how overwhelmingly large the

205
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.519
straight audience is their dictation of
what good gay representation is drowns

206
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:46.199
out what gay men describe as good gay
representation this is the fear anyway

207
00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:49.959
and though I believe it is irrational
the fear comes from a very real very

208
00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:55.199
valid place especially as a conservative
wave once again washes Across America

209
00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:59.399
and sections of Europe which tries to
insist that queer sex should be pushed

210
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:03.800
back into the closet or should simply
cease to exist altogether which is how

211
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.880
they also feel about various queer
people political gay fears seem to be

212
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.360
realized through the mass audien's
reaction to gay characters in media in

213
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.639
conjunction with criticisms against
relatively tame gay sex in one movie the

214
00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:22.519
celebration of sexless queer characters
in another piece of queer media seems to

215
00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:27.959
Echo a 1950s abstinence mandate that
says to Modern young queer people you'll

216
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:32.680
be accepted if you're less like the
characters in red white and royal blue

217
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.759
and more like the characters in

218
00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:47.279
heartstopper let's take a closer look at
heartstopper for a moment this series

219
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.680
skips the usual over-the-top drama and
instead captures the sweet sometimes

220
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.120
clumsy moments of teen love it centers
around two characters Charlie spring

221
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.720
played by Joe lock and Nick Nelson
played by kit con their story takes

222
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.720
place in a typical English high school
and unfolds slowly and gently with each

223
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.000
episode moving the story forward toward
a satisfying emotional climax the story

224
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.279
carefully takes us through their
personal Journeys the difficulties they

225
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:15.920
face with bullying and the joy of
finding someone who truly understands

226
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.600
them all without becoming overly sad or
dramatic the show has a light touch that

227
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.240
perfectly captures how Straits have been
telling us first love feels for

228
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.759
centuries the show gives us a real look
at Charlie as he deals with his

229
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:33.560
sexuality and the need to be accepted
he's not just a stereotype he's a fully

230
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.000
developed character going through the
ups and downs of first love in a very

231
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.040
real way as for Nick the show does a
good job of showing his journey of

232
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.680
understanding that he's bisexual it
talks about the confusion and moments of

233
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.800
clarity that come with figuring out who
you are the series handles these complex

234
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.079
topics with a gentle touch that's both
admirable and sweet Heart Stopper also

235
00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:56.880
shows the diverse experience of
different people in the queer Community

236
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.319
each character has a different story
reminding us that everyone's journey is

237
00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:05.000
unique but there's still a common hope
and strength that they all share the

238
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.039
show is also notable or maybe notorious
for not focusing too much on the sexual

239
00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:15.439
aspects of Nick and Charlie's
relationship this makes heartstopper a

240
00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.240
strong argument against the idea that
gay stories are inherently too focused

241
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.280
on sex and therefore unsafe for kids or
young people to watch but while creating

242
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.000
a story focused on the sweet and cute
over the hot and bothered has attracted

243
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.720
an audience that might not usually watch
a show about queer characters it's also

244
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.200
seemed to alienate a large swath of the
queer Community there's been a rather

245
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.160
weird reaction to the second season of
the show in particular for instance drag

246
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.280
queens Trixie and Kata have a YouTube
series where they review Netflix shows

247
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.200
and movies called Queens who like to
watch when they reviewed the first

248
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.559
season among High fan demand and even
higher personal hesitation it seemed the

249
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:56.000
only point of contention was that Trixie
seem to be irritated by the cute

250
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.320
depiction of gay people that can often
have a was feeling exploited and

251
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.400
patronized while katata liked how cute
it was fast forward to season 2 and even

252
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.600
katata was over the cuteness and wanted
to see something a bit more grown up or

253
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.280
at least see the character's
relationships Advance Beyond hugging

254
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.400
even if it was offscreen the first
season was cute but ask anyone who's

255
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.280
been married for more than 10 years
those cute things about your significant

256
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.480
others start to get annoying real quick
cute wasn't cutting it anymore gay

257
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.679
people were cute when I was growing up
in the same way way that a Geral or a

258
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:34.440
guinea pig would be cute caged fond over
taken out to play with but ignored when

259
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.840
no longer novel and at the time probably
dead within 2 years it felt patronizing

260
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.159
to be reduced to this we were either
neutered and cute such as in teen Focus

261
00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:47.640
TV shows or sexually active and
eventually dead such as in movies like

262
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.840
Brokeback Mountain tell me the
puritanical moralization of sexual

263
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.760
values doesn't exist anymore many
creators lean toward this over the years

264
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.400
as a way to show gay representation
without pissing off the Straits too much

265
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.360
so I can understand why some people in
the gay community especially men my age

266
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.320
who grew up with the Trope of the sexist
gay best friend like Trixie would be

267
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.840
irritated by it even now when there is
pretty mainstream gay movies and shows

268
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.240
that do show the sex stuff like young
Royals and Elite but like I said ki's

269
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.480
opinions seem to shift between the two
seasons our Queens who watch looked at

270
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.200
this story about a collection of various
queer 15 and 16year olds and they spent

271
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.360
the duration of their video railing it
because well nobody was getting railed

272
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.120
at a context I found this reaction a
little bit cringy and truthfully the

273
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.840
only time I really saw Trixie and caught
him miss a Mark heartstopper isn't a

274
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.159
show about sex so why should it be all
about sex they didn't want to see the

275
00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:43.960
characters having sex they just wanted
to know that it was happening or

276
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.159
building up to happening because that
seemed more realistic to them and their

277
00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:51.679
experiences to be clear gay people do
not want to see these characters having

278
00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:56.919
sex but gay people do want to know that
gay sexuality is allowed to exist media

279
00:19:56.919 --> 00:20:01.080
that divorces sexuality from from
identity is to some annoying at best and

280
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.799
triggering at worst not to paint Trixie
and katcha in a bad light they're hardly

281
00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:09.120
alone in fact they're not even the first
to have this reaction there was a slew

282
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.280
of gay men and queer people in general
who held nothing but contempt for

283
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.799
heartstopper from the word go and not
even necessarily for the aformentioned

284
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:21.039
reasons there were many who felt that
heartstopper was simply too edgeless and

285
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:26.400
seemed to be presenting a purity mandate
projected at the entire queer Community

286
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.960
not unlike the messaging jeed at women
in

287
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.919
general there is a trend among discourse
among women about the allotted role of a

288
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:48.480
woman in the patriarchal power structure
men typically want women to be sexually

289
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.960
experienced but they also seem to
allocate a role for women that holds

290
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.200
them to a particular sexual Purity it's
a double standard for sure we have to to

291
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.120
be a boss but you can't be mean you have
to lead but you can't squash other

292
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.720
people's ideas you're supposed to love
being a mother but don't talk about your

293
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.840
kids all the damn time the Madonna
horror complex exists for a reason you

294
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.320
marry the nice girl not the one who'll
give you a in a movie theater

295
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.440
this bothered alenis Moret so severely
that she made one of the greatest songs

296
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.200
of all time because of it suffice to say
women have made it clear that they don't

297
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.559
like having the parameters of their
sexual qualifications gauged by a group

298
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:28.840
outside of women and I get it that's an
annoying

299
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.039
because on top of doing what you want to
do there is a looming social decorum of

300
00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:39.279
what Society not only expects you to do
but will penalize you for not doing all

301
00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:43.400
the while on the example of sexuality
there are other groups of people who can

302
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.760
do all the kinds of sexuality things
that they want without any kind of

303
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.440
repercussion heartstopper seems to
trigger these fears for some gay men

304
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.080
there is a perception that the show is
presenting an argument that the typical

305
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.000
normal healthy gay teenage relationship
should only be as physical as hugging

306
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.799
and a couple of kisses for which this is
compounded through several other

307
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:06.640
high-profile instances of gay media
specifically one which made waves in

308
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.960
2018 but that I will not explicitly
mention for reasons if you know you know

309
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.440
even though I highly doubt that
developing a normative argument that gay

310
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.360
men need to hold themselves to a willful
self-directed abstinence program to be

311
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.440
considered valid by Society at large was
Alice osan's objective to be clear I do

312
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.960
not under any circumstances believe that
Alice Osan is trying to reaet queer

313
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.320
sexuality sex is omitted from their work
as per their license as a Creator but

314
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.720
they do not shame sex in their work
outside of Oman there is a fear of an

315
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.679
external party dictating what is and is
not acceptable sexual behavior among

316
00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:50.440
queer people this fear wouldn't be valid
were it not for a small army of people

317
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.080
who are currently trying to insist that
any queer visibility exists to

318
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.960
indoctrinate and corrupt the youth of
today media that so much as slightly

319
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.520
leans towards that sentiment even if
only perceived triggers this whole

320
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.520
Cascade of hasty generalizations in our
post Disney acquisition of Star Wars

321
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.559
World we've started to conflate the
creation Creator and attitudes of a

322
00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:16.279
fandom we crossed those three wires a
lot and we perceive that the way a

323
00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:20.960
phandom is interacting with a particular
example of media as being the intended

324
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.080
meaning of said Media or even the values
of the Creator themselves take for

325
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.799
instance the recent event of Zach Snider
hiring a transgender writer to write the

326
00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:34.520
prequel comic book for his upcoming
movie Rebel Moon a portion of his fan

327
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:40.440
base made up of red pill basement
dwellers were horrified to learn that he

328
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.360
in fact isn't a horrible person like
them these are also the people who think

329
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.760
homelander is the good guy so just
because there are some people holding up

330
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.080
Nick and Charlie as the archetype of how
gay boys ought to express their

331
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.240
affection does not mean that this is
what the media is intending my

332
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.120
willingness to afford the benefit of the
doubt to aler swath of gays including

333
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.400
Trixie and Kata is that they don't want
to directly observe the sex lives of

334
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.960
these characters but rather comes from
an annoyance for a condition of gay

335
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.919
acceptance being to follow not only the
Purity standards of straight people but

336
00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:17.520
specifically the Purity standards that
are imposed on straight women this may

337
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.240
even betray a thought pattern in society
even from our allies that indicates that

338
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.720
Society at large still does not view gay
men as actual men external factions that

339
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.080
dictate what our sex lives ought to be
are based on the model of what straight

340
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.919
people deem to be acceptable when in
reality queer psychosexual development

341
00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:39.480
happens quite differently especially in
adolescence during a formative age of

342
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.840
communication skills gender is a
cultural barrier between girls and boys

343
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.240
this fluid line of same gender
communication facilitates a greater

344
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.080
opening for interpersonal exploration at
an earlier age this changes the way

345
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.880
queer people approach sex this leads to
a general Comfort towards sexuality in

346
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.679
queer circles and also why it's
troubling to see sex negative sentiments

347
00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:05.000
arising from inside the community even
if a queer person is a late bloomer so

348
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.399
to speak they are conditioned by a
communal culture that was shaped by

349
00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:13.440
early bloomers and thus tend to slip
into the way of thinking regardless and

350
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.240
it's also why the same jokes about the
sex lives of gay men do not apply to gay

351
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.559
women and vice versa the result is a set
of sexual expectations that are almost

352
00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:26.600
completely inverted from heteronormative
expectations for instance second base

353
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.600
for straight people is apparently coping
a feel over clothing second base for gay

354
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.279
men is according to patterns is anal
penetration weirdly gay bases are

355
00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:38.440
reversed from the straight ones the Home
Run system is a gauge used to measure

356
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.240
physical intimacy and commitment where
straight people tend to view sex as a

357
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.240
reward for enduring a slow escalation of
physicality gay people start with oral

358
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.559
on base one and eventually come around
to home base which is holding hands in

359
00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:57.720
public and it's highly coveted gay men
only want one thing and it's disgusting

360
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.600
gusting while second base for lesbians
is reportedly a U-Haul now there's

361
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.480
nothing wrong with depicting gay people
not having sex if we want our queerness

362
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.399
defined based on internal merits rather
than owing public validation to having

363
00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:18.279
someone's hand to hold then this is
Paramount subsequently AO Ace isn't the

364
00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:23.360
only expression of asexuality you can be
gay and Ace at the same time developing

365
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.960
sexuality doesn't mean that we need to
see the characters doing it but but

366
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.520
people in the heat of budding sexuality
are bound to experiment a bit it would

367
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.000
be something that they would talk about
like confirmation through dialogue it

368
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.559
doesn't have to follow Elite's footsteps
but just like being gay or trans not

369
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:48.720
everyone who self-identifies as a sexual
now always knew that about

370
00:26:54.279 --> 00:27:00.360
themselves sex is like broccoli to know
you don't like broccoli you first kind

371
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.840
of have to eat broccoli there's even a
chemical in broccoli that you can only

372
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.880
taste if you have a very specific active
Gene those who have it find broccoli to

373
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.240
be rancid they physiologically cannot
enjoy this vegetable for everyone else

374
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.480
it's great it's
good it's fine given society's push to

375
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:23.360
present sex as pleasurable many start by
trying it out and then spend maybe even

376
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.919
years trying to figure out why it's not
working for them keep in mind that

377
00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:31.440
asexual doesn't always mean no sex drive
Ace like everything else in sexuality is

378
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.279
not only a spectrum but a matrix this is
pertinent as heartstopper author Alice

379
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:39.159
Osman self-identifies as asexual thems
which likely means that as per the

380
00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:43.200
Stanley rule of write the stuff you wish
you could read they want romantic drama

381
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.320
that isn't just focused around sex and
that should be that it should be

382
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.960
abundantly okay for this kind of media
to exist just as it should be abundantly

383
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.559
okay for young Royals and Elite to exist
there is a compelling case for queer

384
00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:58.399
media to portray the more innocent
aspects of life story of friendship

385
00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:02.559
Adventure Coming of Age familial bonds
and the quotidian Joys and struggles

386
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:06.760
that make up the human experience these
stories matter because they reinforce

387
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:12.080
the idea that we queers are not defined
solely by our sexuality by diversifying

388
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.919
the types of stories told within LGBT
media we affirm that queer people lead

389
00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:20.840
Rich complex lives that are worth
depicting in all their facets not just

390
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.679
in relationship to their sexual identity
portraying a range of stories from the

391
00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:27.960
queer perspective also dismantles the
misconception

392
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.279
that our narratives are inherently adult
or explicit it challenges the strawman

393
00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.039
fallacy that the presence of queer
characters in themes just makes

394
00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:38.720
something inappropriate for young
audiences hopefully creating a space for

395
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.640
even more conservative parents to let
their kids watch this media and feel a

396
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.039
little bit less alone in the world
heartstopper fills this role perfectly

397
00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:51.880
but we also have to accept that not
every queer story should be so innocent

398
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.640
when it comes to drag queens and gay
performers especially those who tour

399
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.679
they encounter an astronomical number of
gay and queer people especially among

400
00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.240
other performers they get to know each
other quite well including stories of

401
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.440
their teenage years and this includes my
own discussions with queer people

402
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.840
seriously it's one of those like wait
everyone else was having sex it seems

403
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.559
that in high school for a lot of gays
they took the opportunity to dive deep

404
00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:18.000
into experimentation heartstopper is a
direct contradiction of what many had

405
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.440
either experienced directly or by proxy
and so it feels like it's trying to

406
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.039
develop a puritanical objective for
young gay men alternately and this is

407
00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:29.000
touching on the handholding part of
Heart Stopper is that for gays of a

408
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.360
certain generation and by that I mean
neither too old nor too young being

409
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.640
confronted by heartstopper under the
assumption that it is meant to mimic

410
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.279
reality is triggering believe me a lot
of gays would have loved to instantly

411
00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:43.000
find a high school boyfriend with whom
they felt comfortable enough to explore

412
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.159
emotional intimacy and hold hands the
gay home run as it were however this

413
00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:51.880
generation who are in their late 20s and
early 40s now my generation may have

414
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.159
very well wanted this experience but we
came of age when being out and gay as a

415
00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:59.840
teenager wasn't trending if you don't
mind my flippancy for myself and others

416
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.159
we were the only out gay in school and
so seeing something like heartstopper

417
00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:08.159
may feel like a culture is telling us
that we were doing it wrong alternately

418
00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:11.200
for those who didn't even know that they
were gay as a teenager let alone come

419
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.799
out heartstopper is a reminder of what
could have been again again again this

420
00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:20.080
is a community yes even the CIS gay men
who have undergone complex trauma that

421
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.120
we as a society still do not recognize
as trauma for all that even the

422
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.799
staunchest Allies do to make coming out
easier today we still have to come out

423
00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:32.200
in a society which is grandfathered in a
myriad of cultural attitudes that are

424
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.840
incompatible with queerness which create
natural obstacles for us we exist in an

425
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.960
operating system that is not designed
for us the trauma comes with Society

426
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.960
placing the burden of integration on us
Society does not truly acknowledge this

427
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.760
as trauma because social understanding
of queer trauma is related to bigotry

428
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.320
and not the complex constructed from
watching your straight CIS friends be

429
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.919
able to live out a number of Life
Experiences as they see fit whereas the

430
00:30:58.919 --> 00:31:02.039
queer individual having been raised
under the assumption that they are

431
00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:07.360
straight Andor CIS must make concessions
and compromises based on how soon or

432
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.760
late they shift into their queerness
combined with media that dictates queer

433
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.600
experiences they are going to be across
theboard feelings of I lived my life the

434
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.840
wrong way you are dealing with this
group of people when you develop queer

435
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.559
media we're a tough crowd and rest
assured it's not all our fault with the

436
00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:31.000
amount of com Lex trauma residing in
this group it makes perfect sense that a

437
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
piece of media meant to uplift and
Inspire the

438
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.600
lgbtqia will have the inverse unintended
effect of telling many of these people

439
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.760
that they messed up and that missing out
on all those experiences is their fault

440
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.960
and no you can't go back and fix it like
I came out when I was 12 and I haven't

441
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.080
had an actual boyfriend my whole life
many gay people cope with this by

442
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.240
telling themselves that their teenage
fantasies were simply impossible media

443
00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.159
instances that refute this without
explanation may very well feel like

444
00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:05.120
direct personal
criticism for having trauma trauma

445
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.240
trauma trauma generational trauma trauma
trauma this is what trauma looks like

446
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.200
these are the feelings that Heart
Stopper digs up in some people so it

447
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.159
makes perfect sense why the criticism
would be so focused on presenting

448
00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:22.360
sexuality in a show that is neither
focused on it nor is it required it

449
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.600
makes sense perhaps but it is irrational
even though trauma itself is valid there

450
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.480
is an onus on the individual to respect
their own trauma without pushing it out

451
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.960
into the world but that's just Heart
Stopper what of the opposite an

452
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.399
inability to consume media that is
sexual because it presents those same

453
00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:44.159
sensations of queer fomo perhaps this is
why some gay people are uncomfortable

454
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:47.240
with seeing gay sex in their streaming
movies not because they're squeamish

455
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:52.080
about dicks and butts but because it's
hearkening to a painful reminder of what

456
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.159
they feel like this movie is telling
them they missed out on and I'm sorry

457
00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:59.760
for how polarizing this video is I know
it must seem like I'm jumping around a

458
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.919
lot if I'm not settling on a clear
critical Target it's because I'm not

459
00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:08.320
trying to Target anyone when in fact I'm
trying to defend media's ability to

460
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.639
exist as a Creator's Vision but also
defend why queer people have such a

461
00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:16.639
dodgy relationship with media featuring
queer people nobody's really in the

462
00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:21.240
wrong
here except of course Millennia of

463
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.200
puritanical imperialism and postcolonial
patriarchal values that have resulted in

464
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.639
us feeling like we're overdue for a
little dignity and

465
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.159
autonomy in regards to queer resistance
around media I see two issues the first

466
00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:46.200
being that queer people including gay
men have been so underrepresented for so

467
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.840
long and Tabo predominantly represented
by depictions that moralize US based on

468
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.559
hedonistic etiquette we feel an
obligation to watch queer media where we

469
00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:58.960
are featured in the hopes that it will
break the representation glass ceiling

470
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.000
this is particularly more true for wide
relase high-profile examples of queer

471
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.639
media this is why Bros Got rave reviews
from mainstream critics while Fire

472
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.919
Island was mostly ignored it's also a
very erratic circumstance of media

473
00:34:12.919 --> 00:34:17.119
criticism where red white and royal blue
was targeted for its sexiness but Bros

474
00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.720
upon release was hailed as the Advent of
queer acceptance among mainstream

475
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.800
critics even though it had a lot more
sex among a lot more people and was not

476
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.800
nearly as good we're shooting ourselves
in the foot by following Trends highly

477
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.599
promoted queerness is queerness that has
been bespoke to have as much appeal to

478
00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:38.440
straight audiences as possible think
Brokeback Mountain would that have been

479
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.159
as successful had it not starred two
heart throbs that women wet their

480
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.359
panties over and who simultaneously came
across as Butch enough for straight guys

481
00:34:46.359 --> 00:34:50.960
to feel comfortable with the problem in
practice is that this obligation

482
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.040
implores us to watch media we simply may
not be interested in either outside of

483
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.640
our preferred genre gen or featuring
casting that we don't like or something

484
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.800
which may contain triggering elements
that we don't even know are triggers

485
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800
simply because we don't consider
existing in a society that does not

486
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.119
accommodate our identities as cptsd
trauma the second issue is as per an

487
00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:15.960
unawareness of said complex trauma we
are unable to compartmentalize a

488
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.359
negative reaction to Media as a trauma
response in which case we try to

489
00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:24.280
intellectualize by interpreting this
media as making a normative argument

490
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.839
about all of gay people so like
to quote an incredibly problematic white

491
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:35.240
man dude sometimes a cigar is just a
cigar heartstopper is just trying to be

492
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.280
heartstopper not every artist or author
is out there trying to make a fictional

493
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.000
Manifesto out to reflect and shape the
world I don't think this is limited

494
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.359
exclusively to queer people but we seem
to take every instance of queer

495
00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:52.359
representation as a Manifesto we treat
these media as if each one is actively

496
00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:56.640
trying to set a universal precedent for
the state of modern queerness sometimes

497
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.960
this is true like with Barbie which was
a movie about Womanhood the interaction

498
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:06.480
between wom and the idea of woman and
where men may fit into this idea at

499
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.880
which point you are allowed to disagree
with the premises and conclusions of the

500
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.800
movie you're also allowed to disagree
with some finer points and some nitpicky

501
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.839
elements of the conclusion but overall
enjoy the movie or appreciate that it

502
00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:24.000
exists slightly disagree does not need
to mean burn it in a fire this is

503
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.359
probably the clearest problem that
exists Within leftist spaces today that

504
00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:33.680
is a fallacy of composition it's not
intellectual and it's certainly not sexy

505
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.880
you know who does that the alt-right
Disney made this movie about a strong

506
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.960
female character so the entire company
now has a woke agenda apparently and so

507
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.359
on and so forth the difference being
that those on the right at the very

508
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:52.280
least generally agree on who to hate
we're letting them divide us we have a

509
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.200
reluctance to let queer media be
fantasies instead as we're starved for

510
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.599
visibility we look at each one as the
media that might make or break our

511
00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:04.839
personal autonomy heartstopper is a
fantasy red white and royal blue is a

512
00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:09.560
fantasy young Royals is a fantasy
because for all that heartstopper may be

513
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.079
seen as an early indicator of a total
failure of queer writs it's certainly an

514
00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:19.480
outlier next to a larger body of work
that includes the aention media and many

515
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.000
others heartstopper might be popular but
red white and royal blue is the most

516
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.280
watched Amazon Prime movie in the
history of the Sur

517
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.359
the issue is not with heartstopper but a
fear of living in a population that

518
00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:37.240
leans toward that as the only acceptable
manifestation of queer expressions of

519
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.760
affection which is not an issue with the
media but rather the way we seem to

520
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.680
expect these instances of representation
to apply to the whole of queerness and

521
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.240
that rather than finding red white and
royal blue wanting for not being able to

522
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.520
present the multitudinous range of
queerness we can observe these pieces of

523
00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:00.000
media as being pieces of a growing
whole which seems to be leaning to

524
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.480
Greater inclusivity as it grows this
feels like a popularity contest where

525
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.319
the largest fandom gets to decide what
is and is not an acceptable expression

526
00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:12.720
of queer specifically gay love and the
people who have the smaller Voice next

527
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.400
to a large fandom of teenage girls are
gay people the fear is rooted in a

528
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.920
sensation of not having control over our
own depictions that are projected to

529
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.200
queer people because it's these
fictional examples that are held up as

530
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.079
Arch types for real people to be
compared

531
00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:41.359
to one must acknowledge the historic
invisibility of gay narratives within

532
00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:45.119
the mainstream media landscape the
journey from non-existence to the

533
00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:48.960
peripheries and at long last to have
media with as diverse portrayals as

534
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.560
heartstopper young Royals red white and
royal blue not to mention more adult

535
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.079
focused media has been a sopian task for
the gay community this Travers has been

536
00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:01.839
marred by periods of grotesque
caricature and an almost vois Safari ISM

537
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:05.480
that othered and fetishized gay
relationships casting them in a light

538
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.839
that shimmered with Scandal rather than
substance and these types of portrayals

539
00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:14.520
are far from Gone especially in other
parts of the world but that's a

540
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.960
different video sign up for the patreon
to get us there yet as the pendulum

541
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.880
swung towards inclusivity a new critique
arose from the old prejudices the claim

542
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.280
that gay media is too sexualized conceal
the age-old detraction of the gays

543
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.760
themselves are too sexual in some sense
this reflects a societal discomfort with

544
00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.920
the candid portrayal of homosexual Love
and Desire it is as if the very Act of

545
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.560
two men or two women expressing their
sexuality must be shrouded in a chased

546
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:50.280
Veil lest the onlooker be confronted
with the unvarnished truth of affection

547
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.520
and maybe even have to rethink their own
inner feelings moreover this assessment

548
00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.400
often stems from a myopic view of gay
media taking as its evidence a narrow

549
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.280
selection of works that are
intentionally provocative or which

550
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.640
challenge societal Norms around sex and
sexuality to paint the entirety of gay

551
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:16.040
media with such a broad brush is to
ignore the rich tapestry of stories that

552
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.839
span the spectrum of experience from the
platonic and the familial to the

553
00:40:20.839 --> 00:40:26.400
romantic and yes even the sexual to deny
the sexual component of gay

554
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.040
relationships in media is to deny a
fundamental aspect of human connection

555
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.440
regardless of orientation sexuality
after all is a potent element of The

556
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.079
Human Condition and its representation
in art and storytelling has long been a

557
00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:45.079
conduit for deeper understanding a
mirror reflecting the complexities of

558
00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:49.800
love lust and longing heteronormative
narratives have long enjoyed the

559
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.680
privileged of unabashed sexual
expression without inviting the same

560
00:40:54.680 --> 00:41:01.319
level of scrutiny in contrast gay media
often faces a double-edged sword a

561
00:41:01.319 --> 00:41:05.359
clamoring for representation on one hand
and a prudish recoil at the

562
00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:10.000
manifestation of that representation on
the other there exists an unspoken rule

563
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.200
it seems that gay characters must not
only be present but must also comport

564
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.280
themselves in a manner palatable to the
heterosexual majority their sexuality

565
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.760
expressed with a modesty that is seldom
demanded of The Straits is it not then a

566
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.119
form of cultural suppression to dictate
the terms of representation to confine

567
00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.280
the narratives of a community to the
narrow confines of what is deemed

568
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.880
acceptable by those who wield the
loudest voices gay media in its Essence

569
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.960
is a rebellion against such constraints
a declaration that love in its Myriad

570
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.520
forms will no longer be relegated to the
Shadows perhaps there are naturally

571
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.319
going to be various push back
consequences when dealing with a large

572
00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:56.359
group of people who have been jerked
around let on and outright lied to for

573
00:41:56.359 --> 00:42:00.440
decades knowing our history can
establish a context for why we Face the

574
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.200
struggles we do but also offer us
insight into what methods work to create

575
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.119
change and what methods don't spoiler
alert for gay rights being loud

576
00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:16.440
obnoxious and altogether ungrateful and
shoving our sexuality in people's faces

577
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.079
has tended to be a more successful route
than working within the system and

578
00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:25.720
making friends for marriage equality we
stopped asking politicians to help us

579
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.880
and started demanding equality by hiring
High Price Lawyers and taking people

580
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.960
States and whole countries to court for
being gay in the military we tried it

581
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.640
the nice way and we got don't ass on
tell so then we started marching and had

582
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.000
our gay millionaires threatened to stop
donating to democratic politicians if

583
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.319
they didn't repeal the thing and when it
came to AIDS we did absolutely

584
00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:50.520
everything that every privileged person
says you're not supposed to do if you

585
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:56.400
want people to like you because asking
politely got us ignored even those of us

586
00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:03.319
who knew Ronald Reagan but I digress the
Hallmark of an oppressor is to divorce a

587
00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:06.960
community from its own history it makes
it easier for controlling powers to

588
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.200
dictate what that history was or simply
lie about a political body's involvement

589
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.520
in systemic institutional and social
discrimination the diversity of

590
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.319
relationships and experiences within the
lgbtq community should be

591
00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:25.160
shown not all gay men have the same
experiences nor do all lesbians bisexual

592
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.559
people trans people or queer people in
general and let's not forget the

593
00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:33.000
representation of asexuals and A-
Romantics who are often completely

594
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.640
overlooked in media the inclusion of
diverse relationships and sexual

595
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.520
Dynamics is
important whether it be runchy sex in a

596
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.599
bath house or holding your high school
boyfriend's hand visibility in all forms

597
00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:49.559
of media including media directed at
younger people like heartstopper is

598
00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:54.200
incredibly important there's a growing
resistance to including queer characters

599
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.880
in movies shows and books directed at a
ya or younger

600
00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:03.280
audience based on the misconception that
their presence inherently involves adult

601
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.559
themes however children's media is an
ideal space to introduce the concept of

602
00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:12.839
diverse families and friendships
teaching acceptance and understanding at

603
00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:18.240
a young age
finally we must recognize the queer

604
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.960
representation is not the end goal but
part of a broader movement towards

605
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.920
inclusion and equality it's a means for
storytelling that reflects the world as

606
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.319
it is in all its diversity and at its
best it can influence perceptions and

607
00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:35.440
Foster
empathy it's not just about seeing

608
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:41.319
oneself on screen it's about everyone
seeing the multifaceted World We Share

609
00:44:41.319 --> 00:44:46.240
learning from it and finding the
universal human experiences that connect

610
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.880
us all your experiences are not erased
because Charlie and Nick can hold hands

611
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.800
your trauma is not invalid because
Society doesn't recognize it you don't

612
00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.119
have to live up to the fairy tale that
Alex and Henry's story is told in no

613
00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:05.480
matter what you feel there is no wrong
way to be queer there are no rules

614
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.599
saying if you didn't meet your boyfriend
in high school then you did things wrong
