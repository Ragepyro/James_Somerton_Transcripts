2
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.639
latest episode of the padreon my name is
james i'm nick

3
00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.760
and we just had quite a a time trying to
get these audio recorders to work yeah

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.359
so even just so you know the curse of
audio in this and the james nick

5
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.920
apartment is ongoing never leaves never
goes away never stops never stops it

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.920
lingers over us like a miasma it's you
and it's usually what [ __ ] up when we

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
do
videos too it's like i get to the

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.879
computer and i'm like oh something went
wrong with the audio luckily your new

9
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.160
camera lets you feed audio directly into
it

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.879
well my old camera did too but this one
lets you feed like professional

11
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.719
microphones
um yeah

12
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.559
but yeah so today's um
episode we're going to talk about

13
00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.079
something that nick's been bothering me
to talk about for months it's your idea

14
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.640
in the first place like just kind of
bring it up every time you do a podcast

15
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.199
and like you want to do this one you're
like no let's do this one i'm like okay

16
00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.200
now we're finally doing it and we're
finally doing it

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
um
but yeah so we're going to talk about

18
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.000
being niche
and is niche a good thing is a bad thing

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.920
what what is a niche what is a niche a
niche is a term used primarily in

20
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.560
biology uh to describe certain the way
that sort of neurobiology

21
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.119
continue to describe this i was being
dumb i didn't understand the dumbness

22
00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.159
though
i guess i'm just that dumb um when

23
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.560
you're so dumb you don't understand dumb
right uh dumb and dumber um i think that

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.159
was the sequel to dumb and dumber it was
the sequel yes because there was a

25
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.840
prequel too
yeah and they were going to do a third

26
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.799
one called dumb and dumber or
but jim carrey was like no yeah at that

27
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.200
point he's like no
i have enough money

28
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.880
so a niche is a term used in biology to
describe

29
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
a specific role that an organism has
into a larger ecosystem that isn't

30
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.840
really filled necessarily by anything
else in that ecosystem

31
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.680
um sort of in the way like you'll have
this one

32
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.800
variant species of chipmunk that eats
this that is capable of eating this one

33
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640
poisonous nut
um or poisonous seed or something and

34
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.879
nothing else can eat it but because of
that chipmunk they can redistribute the

35
00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.200
sea

36
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.080
they can redistribute the seed
from their nut

37
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.959
and so because of that chipmunk this
this poisonous plant gets propagated and

38
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.959
only because of that chipmunk that
[ __ ] chipmunk man

39
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.200
yeah
he can carry a lot of nut in his mouth

40
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.840
at the same time um he's patient zero

41
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120
but yeah but what we're referring to as
a nature niche can also be used in terms

42
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.440
of culture culture you know are we are
not scientists

43
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.120
uh in terms of just being able to
develop a product uh or

44
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.360
content that no one else really does and
kind of no one else really does very

45
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.800
well and it's kind of just
something that they've kind of squared

46
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.159
in this very quirky strange thing that
does well for this one creator because

47
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.200
no one else is really doing it like tim
burton

48
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.700
doing weird yes that was a niche yeah
um

49
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.680
[Music]
and then he decided he didn't want to do

50
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.360
that anymore and
well i think he continued to do sorry

51
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.920
i'm bumping things uh i think he
continued to do weird just

52
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.480
incorporating a lot of his niche his
niche was low budget weirdness that kind

53
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.519
of spoke to an element of human
alienation beetlejuice gen x kind of

54
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.280
stuff yeah
beetlejuice edward scissorhands

55
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
uh batman batman nightmare before
christmas that kind of signature stuff

56
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.000
he didn't direct nightmare before
christmas yeah he was a creator though

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.280
yeah uh so like that kind of style of
you know being separate from other

58
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.319
people and being comfortable with your
niche um and now he is the niche and he

59
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.560
just directs movies
now he's well now he's doing a netflix

60
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.280
show about wednesday adams
specifically about wednesday adams

61
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.199
that's interesting which i think is a
cartoon if i remember that's unfortunate

62
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.600
yeah i was really excited at the idea of
him doing a live-action adam's family

63
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.160
the thing about adam's family though is
like you know like came up with the uh

64
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.560
nothing against animation it's just the
adam's family seems like it's too easy

65
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.080
to do with animation like it seems like
it's just much more entertaining to see

66
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.600
all of these disparate characters be
represented physically and kind of like

67
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.440
watch the actors melt into these roles
whereas like you know the animated uh

68
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.840
adam family movie that came up with
charlotte's theron and uh

69
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.199
when they cat when they announced that
casting i was like yeah oh that is

70
00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.080
amazing and then it's animated and like
why do you need to make it animated yeah

71
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.639
you have charlize theron and oscar isaac
yeah just make them gomez and mortician

72
00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.360
yeah and so like you know and the the
way that was animated it's like yeah

73
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.000
it's very typical morticia push charli's
they're on in a black wig there um like

74
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.720
um
oscar isaac looks like uh gomez yeah um

75
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.080
just you know it would play up the fact
that gomez is supposed to be you know of

76
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.520
hispanic south american descent yeah and
then like you know

77
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.360
um but you know the way they animated it
as gomez gomez's round morticia is tall

78
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.639
and has a bit of an hourglass morticia
looks like she came from the oblongs

79
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.800
yeah and it's all very stock
you'll get that reference

80
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.960
it's just more fun to see this come to
life in live action whereas other movies

81
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.759
would do much better as cartoons or
animation or

82
00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.639
cg what's what is it cgi what's the cgi
animation specifically according to the

83
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.000
oscars live action lol
um

84
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.039
yeah lion king
um so like [ __ ] disney

85
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.960
it always comes back to the mouse yeah
so some movies are better i i think it

86
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.639
kind of does because
disney destroyed

87
00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.039
niche
because

88
00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.880
they had a niche they had princesses
yeah and fairy tales that was the disney

89
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.400
niche
and then bob iger

90
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.039
uh when he became ceo really started to
expand the niche

91
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.840
and
it became

92
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.630
everything to everyone
everywhere else

93
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.400
[Laughter]
you know buying up star wars and marvel

94
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.800
and fox and and everything else and it
got rid of disney's niche now disney now

95
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.639
you've got people saying like disney
doesn't feel like disney anymore because

96
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.039
it kind of doesn't the problem the thing
about that is i liked when disney was a

97
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.880
relatively minor portion of the box
office

98
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.479
is like disney was a niche
the problem isn't that they were

99
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.680
diversifying is that they are buying a
bunch of stuff and they are forcing

100
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.120
everything else to be disney
they're forcing marvel to be disney

101
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.960
they're forcing star wars to be disney
like with the whole uh book of boba fett

102
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.720
spin shot like with that guy in the last
episode oh yeah

103
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.720
that doesn't kill people now it's
becoming very disney fied and america

104
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.680
chavez um you know
um kamala khan like it's it's being

105
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.280
kamala khan was kind of designed if
there is anything that's disney disney

106
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.120
viable it's kamala she was basically
created to be a disney channel character

107
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.840
yeah except for the fact that her super
they've got her power they're they're

108
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.479
making erogenous changes to her powers
erotic egregious egregious

109
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.919
changes to the underage girl's power
oh my goodness yeah agree just changes

110
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.800
to her powers and um specifically the
creator of kamala khan said that she

111
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.319
wanted from the start she didn't want
kamala's power set to be a sparkly

112
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:42.560
glittery glow um power kaboom boom yeah
she wanted it to be like kamala's power

113
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.960
set was um meant to represent like
coming of age like your body is growing

114
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.800
at weird and weird yeah in weird ways
yeah so you know like representing that

115
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.000
very pubescent growth spurt sort of
thing i was like i understand them not

116
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.360
wanting to do that because it's
basically mr fantastic yeah

117
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.960
and also um marvel the way that marvel
is handling um

118
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.400
moon night or mishandling moonlight
mental mental health and noon night

119
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.599
um
according to at least earlier reviews of

120
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:10.800
the show saying that maybe disney should
not be a thing something that covers

121
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.639
something like severe yeah that disney
is a company that probably yeah that

122
00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:19.120
shouldn't cover shouldn't try to cover
you know anxiety and depression that's

123
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.080
that those are disney viable things but
yeah inside out yeah yeah

124
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.199
incredibly well what is identity
dissociation disorder is that it um it's

125
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:33.120
d.i.d d.i.d dissociative identity right
i flipped two of them but yeah that's

126
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.080
something that maybe disney should not
cover because that is a a mental

127
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.360
disorder that's associated with extreme
trauma yeah um disney did did the wrong

128
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.680
way yeah
and that's the kind of trauma that you

129
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.120
can't show on disney by the disney brand
unless disney would be willing to

130
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.519
diversify its brand and actually say
like we bought fox for a reason instead

131
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:57.839
of being like
we bought fox on an elon musk whim

132
00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:02.399
basically um
so yeah like you know like disney and

133
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:05.839
that's where where i counter argue that
is disney isn't losing its niche disney

134
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.640
is forcing everything to be in the
disney niche which means it's not a

135
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.920
niche anymore
well yeah because when you're forcing

136
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.360
marvel to be in the disney niche and
you're forcing star wars to be in this

137
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.320
by all means there are marketing
properties that would be disney viable

138
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.560
and you're forcing um
fox properties to be in the disney niche

139
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.000
and you're forcing hulu properties to be
in the disneyland rocky holidays

140
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.240
you're forcing all of these things to be
in the disney niche

141
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.720
you that little that kind of makes it so
that

142
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.360
if anyone wants to compete with you
they need to out disney disney yeah and

143
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.839
like or give something else completely
which creates what we're talking about

144
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:49.519
really which is the smaller niches of
what people want dark superheroes um

145
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:53.360
weird um
weird multiverse stuff weird multiverse

146
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.560
stuff really heady science fiction yeah
and like you know we're kind of

147
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.920
speculating we've expected before like
there might be a growing demand for this

148
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.519
because everyone is trying to be disney
and disney is trying to out disney

149
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:07.680
disney do you see the new the uh new
pixar movie called elementals

150
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.160
no it's um
oh god uh look it up um at the

151
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.680
description it's basically
uh there it's it's

152
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.120
zootopia and avatar smashed together in
the most shameless way possible um it's

153
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.839
there's a city and people in the city
are divided between the four elements of

154
00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:31.600
earth water wind and fire uh really
yes water wind and fire and the story is

155
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.040
about how um
two people have been there ellis where

156
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.120
are you from opposing elements end up
becoming friends and kind of work out

157
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.480
their city's differences and it's like
oh they're actually made of fire and

158
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.680
water yeah yeah it's still shameless
though oh it absolutely is um avatar the

159
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.079
last airbender is over 10 years old stop
trying to ape on it and make your own

160
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:55.360
stuff
the movie was inspired by the director's

161
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.680
childhood in new york was it really was
it really was luca inspired by the

162
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.360
director's childhood in in in italy
that's gonna be just their like cop out

163
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.399
from now on the director's childhood
story it's like

164
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.200
that way they don't have to
do anything but well yeah it's like you

165
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.519
know you can't they can't say it's like
basically [ __ ] is the entirety of

166
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.160
talking about disneyland i'm tired of
talking about disney doesn't exist

167
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.680
anymore they're a black hole in orlando
the mouse should be public domain by now

168
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.160
it literally should that rat should be
public domain it may very well be in a

169
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.839
year or two
yeah depending on the supreme court goes

170
00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:31.200
no it's not the supreme court it's
congress that has to pass that law

171
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.040
interesting
yeah

172
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.760
um
and conservatives hate disney because

173
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.600
disney's not conservative enough and
progress democrats i know democrats in

174
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.680
general
would like disney to not have a monopoly

175
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.760
and so disney's got everyone against
them so mickey mouse might be up for

176
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.040
public domain porn very soon um
but uh oh my god the men.com video i

177
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.790
can't even
men.com doesn't wait for public domain

178
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.920
[Laughter]
they make horrible stuff

179
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.240
out of copywritten stuff all the time
but anyway

180
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.519
so this kind of grew out of us talking
one night about how what's our thing i

181
00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:19.120
am very like i as a youtuber and like we
as a creative duo

182
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.760
are very niche yeah because it's like
well you're gay so you're obviously

183
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.399
niche well that's you're creating queer
content from the start that's already

184
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.200
like a section off there because like
there aren't a whole lot of straight

185
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.720
people making queer content
for youtube

186
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.680
yeah um
[Music]

187
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.399
but uh
and so it was kind of like

188
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:41.440
all right so
that's what happened like i started out

189
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.560
on youtube for instance let me tell my
story

190
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.880
um i started out on youtube for instance
making videos about

191
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.399
like
just movies and hollywood and what was

192
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:59.519
going on in hollywood and movie reviews
and stuff like that and it was very

193
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:04.160
run-of-the-mill escapist magazine um
[Music]

194
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.720
escape escapees.com

195
00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:14.320
well i was trying to
ape things that i liked yeah like i was

196
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.480
trying to do the stuff that was on
escapist uh the escapist website like

197
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.800
movie bob and zero punctuation and stuff
like that i was turn and then later on

198
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.200
um after we met i was trying to do
almost like a grace randolph um collider

199
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:36.079
movie news style thing yeah we did that
on a cup for a couple of episodes um

200
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.839
no that wasn't a podcast we we shot
those we filmed those we stood in front

201
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:44.399
of the camera right i rem
getting a mental block oh my god it's

202
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:47.760
all flooding back in at the same time oh
my god i don't remember doing it i

203
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.440
remember watching it back in that tiny
little apartment oh god that was awful

204
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.040
and i had to read lines that was
terrible oh yeah

205
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.360
um because we were trying to be like
collider movie talk and stuff like that

206
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.360
and i was always trying to be something
else

207
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.519
and it wasn't really until
i kind of had the realization

208
00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:11.040
well it wasn't really a realization but
i was like you know gays love horror

209
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.480
movies because all of my gay friends
were super i forget what movie it was i

210
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.600
think it might have been it that was
coming out the first one and they were

211
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.440
super super excited for it and it really
got you thinking well yeah i was like

212
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.160
guys love horror movies and then i was
like nobody talks about that yeah and so

213
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.680
i was like i'm gonna make a video about
that and turned into three videos which

214
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.199
is now
one video one long video on my channel

215
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:37.920
monsters in the closet
which was what two years after i

216
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.839
released it
jumped the the

217
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.440
channel into
significance um

218
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.120
and it was because
where were the other gays talking about

219
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.639
horror movies
and it really then i just started kind

220
00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:56.560
of going with that like
at first it was just me i was writing

221
00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.639
the scripts like i did the disney video
i did deep cuts uh i did the porn

222
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:05.120
documentary
the history of queerbaiting um

223
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.079
that's when i started to help out like
just kind of like you know offering sort

224
00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:12.060
of like a paragraph or two to the thing
no that was um

225
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.199
[Music]
uh in the

226
00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:18.560
the
the queer coding video yeah you helped

227
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.760
right that was the first one you helped
write and then i did the holocaust video

228
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.440
and then we did power couples and then
we've been working together since power

229
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.279
couples write the holocaust video but i
did off you helped me edit it oh yeah a

230
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:33.440
lot of it like edit the script uh the
original script as i recall it was in a

231
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.560
very different order than the final one
it was in a different order and it was

232
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.320
much longer yeah we restructured a lot
of it and especially because like when

233
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.639
you came when as you were writing it
you're writing it when you were at work

234
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:46.320
so you basically were just hammering it
out and so it was much longer because

235
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.440
you repeated entire sections yeah um as
things came up relevance and so we kind

236
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.040
of sat together and be like does this
work better earlier does it work at work

237
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.440
i was working from home the pandemic had
started like um so like and just in

238
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.279
terms of just being niche like you know
like you tried to compete

239
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.839
in terms of like the biology you tried
to compete with other

240
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:13.279
uh organisms that already had their food
chains as collider grace randall's um

241
00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.519
the other ones you mentioned they have
their they have literal sources in

242
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:21.519
hollywood business video game business
um they know how to you know kind of get

243
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:24.320
the
get the scoop and i was trying to do

244
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.519
what they did
but just from

245
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:32.079
my point of view yeah um and you know
people

246
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.040
don't care what
random dude on the internet's point of

247
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.959
view is um no they don't care they do
care about points of view they don't

248
00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:42.160
care about like just like this person is
saying the same thing that i can get on

249
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.639
another channel yeah yeah that's what i
mean like random guy yeah unique insight

250
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:50.880
is what they care about and so like the
uh finding the niche was less about

251
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.839
making a decision to be like i'm gonna
do what nobody else is doing it's just

252
00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:58.160
like i want to do what i want to do well
it was like specifically

253
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.839
i love documentaries
i adore documentaries and there are not

254
00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:05.679
enough documentaries about the film
industry

255
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:09.439
and there's not an entertainment the
entertainment industry as a whole

256
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:12.720
there are not enough documentaries about
gay history

257
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.000
and sort of looking at that being like i
can just do both at the same time and

258
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.039
like they're video essays but they're
kind of mini documentaries

259
00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:26.079
um some of them are blatantly
documentaries yeah but like

260
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.760
and that became the niche that's where
and like killing stalking kind of

261
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.240
exploded it because it brought a lot of
attention but the people who

262
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.240
watch the channel
aren't watching it

263
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.480
because i make killing stocking content
they're watching it because they like

264
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.760
the content that i do make yeah um like
i said they they come for the unique

265
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.440
perspective they come for the ideas and
that and like because there are other

266
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.640
queer creators who do talk about media
and stuff like that on youtube i mean

267
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.760
like not to toot my horn or not but i
think i helped a lot for sort of

268
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.520
developing the niche that we have
because like you're very descriptive you

269
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.240
love kind of talking about things well
you're very analytical yeah and that's

270
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.880
where we really complement each other
because the way things usually go is

271
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.440
like if it's a synopsis except for the
video coming up if it's synopsis

272
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.400
james wrote it if it's analysis nick
wrote it yeah um because like you like

273
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.919
the you're a very details oriented
person you like you know the details you

274
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:23.120
know the insights and how to do a lot
more research whereas i'm much more of a

275
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.440
critical thinker yeah i sort of take you
watch something and then have thoughts

276
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.400
yeah i have thoughts i connect it to
different elements of culture i kind of

277
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.039
spot spostulate postulate but during the
upcoming video

278
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.280
videos
um

279
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.120
which i think what i'm going to do
since this is the patreon is actually

280
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.320
release it as one video wholesale for
patrons and then two videos for normal

281
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.679
youtube yeah
but anyway um

282
00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:54.080
that video has a lot of synopsis sizing
because this whole affair

283
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.000
uh has a lot of synopsisizing but only
because

284
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.160
these are movies that a lot of people
may not have watched yeah and so there

285
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.679
needs to be a certain even
majority of it is really analyzing

286
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.799
it and you know i don't want to get into
detail on it because then what's the

287
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:14.559
point of watching the video but i went
into the synopsis for what i felt was

288
00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:18.320
relevant for the camp topic
i didn't really

289
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.000
sorry i tried to stay away from details
as a whole but like you know i tried to

290
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.840
focus on those highlights yeah that's
what i mean you were doing analysis you

291
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.400
were
and so that's

292
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.039
what the channel then very and i think
it's a very niche

293
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.360
thing that the channel has become
that is

294
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.679
we do
two things

295
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:44.160
we take a piece of media that that is
either queer or has a queer reading

296
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.679
or can have a queer reading
um

297
00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:50.880
and
we do the queer reading

298
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.600
and we associate it with something
important in society yeah some kind of

299
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.320
cultural significance yeah like with um
our flag means death it was you know the

300
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.280
sort of coming out of the closet the
hidden game coming out of closet late in

301
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.960
life specifically in life
um

302
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.840
and
not that's what the longer videos the

303
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.159
pocket gays are mostly like here's a
thing that i watched

304
00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:19.520
i liked it or i didn't like it and
you know here's some thoughts on it in a

305
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.080
grander scope
um

306
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.280
which a lot of people
for instance the the fantastic beasts

307
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.320
video a lot of people have watched that
they're like i don't know why you get

308
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.039
off on doing this
uh political stuff in a movie review

309
00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.919
like it's not a movie review [ __ ]
look at the other videos on the channel

310
00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:40.400
it's not a movie review and identity is
not political so yeah

311
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.039
um
but uh that's kind of the very

312
00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:49.280
strict niche
that we have kind of put ourselves into

313
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.440
and i say strict but it it
literally

314
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.640
everything has a queer reading yeah like
we've said kill bill has a queer reader

315
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.280
oh yeah yeah yeah like
saying that something has a queer

316
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.640
reading isn't necessarily saying that
something is queer hiddenly it's saying

317
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.159
like no
based on certain tenets of queer theory

318
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:12.159
you can look at this media through a
queer lens and analyze how it uh either

319
00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:16.799
exemplifies heteronormativity or resists
it or the relationship it has with

320
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:20.799
heterosexual
uh relationship dynamics yeah um and i

321
00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:25.280
think kill bill has a very interesting
queer reading because um

322
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.440
specifically the bride the two times two
of the three times she comes closest to

323
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.679
death is because of a ball and chain
yeah uh literally and figurative with

324
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:38.000
her actual with her marriage yeah
and i think that's really interesting

325
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.799
um
and you know like i've i've been talking

326
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:45.440
about and i am going to do an attack on
titan video at some point and when you

327
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.120
look at it very
when you look at the the show and the

328
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.960
manga from a very just sort of
bird's eye point of view there's really

329
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.799
no queer reading of
of attack on titan there's no like there

330
00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:01.679
are a couple of characters who are red
as queer um who the author has indicated

331
00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:06.240
they are queer yeah um there's hanji
there's levi there's historia

332
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.120
um
there's emir

333
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.679
uh
but they're not like obvious queer

334
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:17.360
characters it's not like their arc isn't
about being queer

335
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.440
um
but there's a lot in the world of attack

336
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.280
on titan that is rife for queer yeah
how like even just starting off

337
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.360
um
aaron starts off the series feeling

338
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.480
trapped he can't escape from this thing
in this mold that he has been put in

339
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.960
and then
um sort of breaking the gender dynamics

340
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.320
of you know oh the woman is the
housekeeper and the man is the the

341
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.039
breadwinner with the
right with the core yeah because you

342
00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.360
know
men and women

343
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:57.200
have to fight yeah and it is you know
men who are weak and feminine and men

344
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.600
who are butch and women who are feminine
and women who are butch and they have to

345
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.039
work together and everything and there's
a lot there

346
00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:09.760
and especially you know then the the
coming out moment that when the when

347
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.720
they get out of the walls and they
realize what's outside of the walls and

348
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.919
they see that
oh

349
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:21.039
people hate me for no reason
like yeah that's that's there

350
00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:25.280
people hate me for no reason
so like there's oh well there's there's

351
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.400
a reason but you know 2 000 years ago
get over it well also some people would

352
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.039
argue that there is a reason for hating
gay people so yeah contrary so like yeah

353
00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:36.159
so there is a queer reading of it so
it's like no matter what the movie or

354
00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:40.080
the show or whatever there's a queer
reading of it yeah and yeah and so like

355
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.520
and there's something about me mad about
the queer coding video you're saying no

356
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.320
not everything's queer and it's like
we're not saying it's queer we are

357
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.559
saying you can look at this clearly
and that that does bother me but anyway

358
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:54.159
to getting back and talking about like
about niche so like

359
00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:59.360
um our niche coming up about seems
interesting because like when we

360
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.840
even though like we didn't really think
of it as a niche to begin with we're

361
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.520
like we're just making video essays
about things that appeal to us or things

362
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.200
that resonate with us or
things that piss me off yeah things that

363
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.039
are on our radar it's like we did it
from an angle that it seems to

364
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:18.159
not there weren't a whole lot of people
analyzing it specifically from that

365
00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:22.559
angle even like other queer youtubers
who did queer queer video essays

366
00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:25.840
um
it just seems that we did have this kind

367
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.039
of best of both worlds with you and i to
sort of um

368
00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:31.919
well yeah because a lot of queer
youtubers you know they're they're a

369
00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:36.559
one-person show
um you know they're not these they don't

370
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:40.320
have a team where there's you know two
or three writers and then there's the

371
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.840
person and then there's an editor and
like all of that stuff

372
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.520
um they don't have people shooting their
videos for them and stuff like that it's

373
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.600
them and a camera and an editing uh
program

374
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.000
um
and so you know we

375
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.400
we basically are that we don't have a
big team with six or seven people

376
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.520
but
we have two very different thought

377
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.960
processes when it comes to writing the
script and luckily when it comes to the

378
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.320
script we haven't really clashed that
much on like what needs to be in a video

379
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.880
or what doesn't need to be in a video no
like you're con your your your process

380
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.760
most of the time is like if it's there
we'll just it doesn't matter if it's

381
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.919
long like um yeah
it's like when we started working on the

382
00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:25.600
camp video and you were getting really
nervous because it was getting long and

383
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.880
long and long
and spoiler alert the mommy dearest

384
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.159
section is particularly long yeah um
and then i read it so much to sink your

385
00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:38.240
teeth into it
i actually then i read the script that

386
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.320
you would the parts of the script you
had written and i'm like no this is

387
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.840
great okay we don't need to cut anything
um

388
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.200
like i've you know i've gone through and
i've cut some stuff and added some stuff

389
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.880
throughout but like
i i don't care how long and especially

390
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.360
like when it comes to like you i think
you're a lot more nervous when it comes

391
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.039
to like you changing like words or
sentences than you are it's like when it

392
00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.679
comes to you reading something or
something that

393
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:07.039
because we you and i i'm not okay you
and i speak very differently and i write

394
00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:11.360
things i i if i wrote things to be
written to be spoken in your voice it

395
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.480
would take me way longer to write them
yeah so i write things from my voice so

396
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.520
that it's just easier and flows easier
and a lot of that actually comes when

397
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.840
we're shooting i will change things on
the fly yeah which you're then

398
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.520
furiously on the keyboard changing it
for the subtitles what happens though

399
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.600
what i've noticed this is this is a
pattern it doesn't need to be true i

400
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.080
noticed that when it comes to my writing
you stick to the script more but when

401
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.840
it's your sections you are a lot more
fast and loose with how to with how you

402
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.440
phrase things while you're in the mo of
the moment i never really realized that

403
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.559
but because i do kind of keep in track
keep track of what's mine and what's

404
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.760
yours yeah uh and that's just an
observation i have it's something that's

405
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.039
interesting um and i think it's because
your style of speaking is much more

406
00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:55.360
fluid and conversational yeah so it
really depends on how the moment strikes

407
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.240
whereas my writing is a little bit more
structured in the sense that i'm

408
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.400
building to something yeah um but like
when yeah like

409
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.679
when it comes to editing process i
really don't mind you sort of switching

410
00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:09.760
a sentence around
um so that it just reads better in your

411
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.440
voice yes like we speak very very
differently yeah

412
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.440
um
[Music]

413
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.640
and so yeah back to niche like
we've created this yeah

414
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.000
this niche that
shockingly to me is growing

415
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.919
much quicker
than i would have expected so like

416
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:33.279
because there's creators out there who
cover the same kind of stuff queer

417
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:37.919
content as us
and they've been around much longer

418
00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:42.240
and the subscriber base isn't there
and you know it could be for any number

419
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.679
of reasons a lot of them are women
um

420
00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:50.000
you know and then there's this you know
white guy talking and more people are

421
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.200
more likely to click subscribe because
it's another white guy on youtube like

422
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.240
honestly like
if i had to pay anything i think it's

423
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.520
because we are both very inappropriate
about how it looks

424
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.120
well i think that's the thing a lot of
people watch the videos as podcasts they

425
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.320
don't watch them they listen which is
fine can you lean forward there's a

426
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.679
piece of foam on the side of your head i
can get the phone okay okay it's gone

427
00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:14.399
okay excellent um
but yeah like the

428
00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:19.600
they listen to them as podcasts so they
don't see the the cinematography a very

429
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.279
asmr soothing voice so like you know
it's there you've got to your voice is

430
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:26.559
very bassy so it's very powerful but at
the same time you're very soft but

431
00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.799
you're
i don't know if sauce spoken right word

432
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:31.919
but there is a s
calmness

433
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:36.159
no i don't think so but not soft what's
the wrong looking for uh sound off in

434
00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:39.039
the comments
um

435
00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:42.480
but like a lot of that's that's one
thing i've noticed is that like a lot of

436
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.760
people
like have commented that

437
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.480
when i
and i do this purposefully like break

438
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.600
in the script and i get flustered yeah
it cut catches them off guard and they

439
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.919
laugh because it's gone from you know
this 2020 dateline

440
00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:04.720
examination of this thing
to a youtuber

441
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.640
like that yeah and then it's back to
2020 dateline

442
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.600
um i know they're different shows uh
there's this jesus that was my favorite

443
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.360
one you said that
we had it scripted i think that was

444
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.880
actually my line because i was
referencing the garfunkel notes song um

445
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.919
we can say swears right yes [ __ ] me in
the ass cause i love jesus um

446
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:32.080
i was referencing that song specifically
uh by the way if you're listening i'm a

447
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.200
huge fan um i loved your netflix series
um

448
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.279
it's about catholic girls having sex
yeah

449
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:45.600
i've heard the song i just didn't know
so like you said it you delivered it

450
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.440
that way and i
bust a gut and i think we had to redo

451
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.520
the take because i started laughing
because like my brain immediately went

452
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.440
reading that to like
like

453
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.200
church mom in atlanta i kind of think
yeah

454
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.960
um legs close geez and that's what i
mean like you know i'll write something

455
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.480
a certain way and you'll interpret
things a different way and it'll just be

456
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.559
like this weird chaotic yeah
but like when it comes to being niche

457
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:18.640
because we are super niche like i do not
expect

458
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.480
this youtube channel to ever no matter
how long we do it no matter how much

459
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.559
time we put into it to ever be like
pewdiepie hold up some people no not

460
00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:30.159
pewdiepie but like i'm just talking
about like subscribers like yeah it's

461
00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:33.039
we're never gonna get that diamond
plaque from youtube for 10 million

462
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.720
subscribers just hold up for a second
because like you thought we'd never get

463
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.799
to the level of patrons that we have
right now no but it's different it's

464
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:46.559
different i am not
unsure about i like i was very like well

465
00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:51.600
i will never get a million subscribers i
am not unsure about that now because

466
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.159
well i'm a fifth of the way there
um and only really been doing this for a

467
00:30:56.159 --> 00:31:01.440
year and a half yeah but like the 10
million mark that's for like lucky

468
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.080
brownlee and stuff like that
i wouldn't have ever expected that but i

469
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.200
mean like you know like uh comparing to
other video essayists

470
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.200
um like yeah like i don't think it's
impossible too

471
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.919
at one point like when we had our
discussions about niche it seemed like

472
00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:20.880
okay we're gonna have a subscriber base
a patron base but there's gonna be a

473
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.360
glass ceiling because we are talking
about something that is a little bit

474
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.880
niche and especially like more recently
more and more

475
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.799
there's a lot of queer people getting a
little bit shattered so it's like do we

476
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:35.279
have a niche like in terms of just
catering to a very hungry fan base that

477
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:39.600
is limited or is this is our niche
something that was demanded that hasn't

478
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.720
been met
uh just i think it was like i said there

479
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.760
are plenty of queer youtubers who do
what we do um you know

480
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.840
it may they
the videos may not look as cinematic or

481
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.679
you know they might be shorter videos
like whatever it might be but there are

482
00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:59.600
plenty of people who do what we do
um

483
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.240
i suppose that's kind of the question of
like that you're asking earlier is like

484
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.559
why is this taking off the way it is
i don't think i'm asking why i think i

485
00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:10.159
think i know
why i'm asking why so we can do it so we

486
00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:13.919
can do more of it like it's not like oh
my god how is this happening it's like

487
00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:18.320
no like like if we knew why
things were going as well as they were

488
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.600
we'd be able to like kind of capitalize
on that and make it a bit better so that

489
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.080
never works i said capitalize i'm sorry
like i look at i look at like the

490
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.039
youtube analytics and i'm like okay this
video did really well so i'm gonna do

491
00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:32.559
another video like this one then it gets
no views yeah um

492
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:36.399
so like the way i kind of look at it is
throw [ __ ] at the wall and see what

493
00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:40.480
sticks well once again that kind of fits
into that niche territory that launched

494
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.600
in the closet end up filling and getting
you know you noticed like doing what you

495
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.200
want always ends up being more
successful and you know other youtubers

496
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.120
will be able to tell you that like jenna
maroney uh not jenna maroney jenna

497
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.120
marbles
um

498
00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.880
jenna marbles because she had that
really awkward middle phase where she

499
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.760
just did nothing but she was trying to
do what other people wanted her yeah she

500
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.720
was doing nothing but viewer requests
and she was getting progressively more

501
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.880
and more depressed as she went into that
just v tuber sort of territory yeah

502
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.120
and like and then she just started doing
weird stuff again and that's why i'm

503
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.760
very hesitant
when

504
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.880
p and this
every day there's multiple comments of

505
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.399
oh my god have you watched x you need to
make a video about it

506
00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:28.640
um and i'm very hesitant because i'm
like

507
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.360
i'll look it up and be like i'm not
interested

508
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.840
well yeah cause like and like at this
point like

509
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.760
with supernatural for instance i don't
want to make a supernatural video but i

510
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.480
promised it i mean like
so like i am not a fan of supernatural

511
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.880
in fact i
would rather it didn't happen like i'm

512
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.080
kind of in that kind of salty era i
i don't see the value i actually really

513
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.000
dislike the creators in terms of the
messaging they put out there i dislike

514
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.679
the their interpretations of like this
weird biblical

515
00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:06.080
uh sort of theological battle patrons
out there patrons listening patrons

516
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.359
patrons um
if you

517
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:13.119
would like to see something other
than

518
00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:16.480
a supernatural a special supernatural
video

519
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.280
please tell us
uh comment down below

520
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.879
message me on twitter message nick do
whatever and let us know because

521
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:30.720
uh i'll do anything else
the thing i'm just leading up to saying

522
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.440
is like inspiring don't say owl house
because that's coming because i'm

523
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.720
actually excited to do the owl house
video because i get to dunk on disney

524
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.960
again yeah um
i just said i was sick of time kirk

525
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.119
about disney
um but no like coming soon disney's a

526
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:49.200
dick when it comes to supernatural even
though i really really dislike it

527
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.280
there's a lot for me to talk about why i
dislike it uh there's so much of it

528
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.440
there is so much of it and i think that
it just misses so spectacularly on

529
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.880
everything that i'm trying to accomplish
in a way that people

530
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.640
really don't seem to understand how it
misses uh just in terms of the way i

531
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.359
think that can work like with riverdale
but that misses at every shot but it has

532
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:14.400
by missing it has become camp supreme
yeah but like like i was saying like

533
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.760
even though i don't like it and i don't
want to do a video on it it fits the

534
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.359
brand of the channel the content we will
make about a supernatural about

535
00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:24.560
supernatural for a video will fit the
brand i don't even know what the video

536
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.040
will be about though um i have a vague
idea because i've watched it because i'm

537
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.720
already done the queerbaiting as for
instance it not only does it queerbaits

538
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.839
but everything in my clear baiting video
i specifically said i didn't do

539
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:42.720
supernatural but every every time
they have any somewhat competent female

540
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.400
strong female character on the show they
immediately kill her off

541
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.240
and like i say they accident because
they're so obs the show is so obsessed

542
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.480
with being incredibly hyper masculine
that they murder and sort of just remove

543
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.760
systemically remove every female lead
they could possibly have on there they

544
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.520
go for a full circle and it's gay again
it's like it's like krog in the comics

545
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.800
um the
uh marvel character krog

546
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.520
uh hello prague
pork corg my name is corco made out of

547
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.520
rocks
as you can see yeah korg korg okay not

548
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.960
krog uh cork in the marvel comics he
actually comes from a race of all

549
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.880
uh all men only men and it's certain in
the comics like it's not like taika or

550
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.320
td's voicing him it's it's very much
depicted at james is playing with a

551
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.000
little plastic container sorry it's very
much depicted as um

552
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.000
uh it's very much depicted as like all
this is hyper because it was in peak

553
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.280
planet hulk sort of territories like all
this is a hyper masculine race they're

554
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.520
all men and ah yeah they're made out of
rocks and it turns out like okay you

555
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:49.119
accidentally made an entirely gay
species yeah like oops oopsies and

556
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:52.320
that's kind of what happens with
supernatural is because there's because

557
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.480
they keep killing off female leads there
is no one to pair these men with but

558
00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.560
each other yeah so that's how it
accidentally became so incredibly

559
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.800
horrible i think that probably happens a
lot that there it's like

560
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.160
where there's
maybe not killing off female leads but

561
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.320
kind of like the lack of yeah i've
actually heard that from shippers uh

562
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.200
people who do like write fine fiction
and stuff say like the reason we who's

563
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.320
he's supposed to kiss well yeah it's
like the reason we do that the reason we

564
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.560
ship these two men is because shipping
them with the women is boring because

565
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.920
these women are boring yes i am a
straight woman i'm heterosexual i love

566
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.079
my boyfriend
but i am not going to pair uh said anime

567
00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:34.079
character with said female lead because
she's useless and has absolutely nothing

568
00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:39.599
to do with anything um naruto is a prime
example um

569
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:45.280
sasuke is the oh what's what's sakura
i have no idea pink hair girl who the

570
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.880
fan base just completely rails as being
completely useless pink haired anime

571
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:55.440
girl that doesn't narrow it down
so [ __ ] specific

572
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.119
so yeah like that kind of process in
fanfiction uh

573
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:04.000
or in media is kind of a thing that
leads to fan fiction yeah um so yeah

574
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.240
supernatural i think does fit the brand
we can make a video about it if no one

575
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.920
has any other suggestions um any
suggestions

576
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.560
it's literally like as specifically from
patrons because like if you guys want

577
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.680
the supernatural video
i will make it

578
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.400
but if you guys want something else in
its place for that 2000 patron mark

579
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.320
like by all means leave your suggestions
yeah and that's and that's a problem

580
00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.599
with a lot of uh content creators is
that when they are forced to create

581
00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:37.359
content they don't actually want to make
content about it comes across in the

582
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:42.000
content yeah like lackluster
people it's it's boring i can't think of

583
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.520
engaging i don't think i've made a video
yet about something i didn't want to

584
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.520
make a video about yeah and that's why
trixie and katja the beginning of every

585
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.240
show say this is our show not yours yeah
like the only one that i can think of

586
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.350
that comes close
was um

587
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.599
[Music]
yuri on ice

588
00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:06.720
and that was because i had no interest
in anime yeah in watching anime and but

589
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.440
then once i watched it i was like
oh yeah i can do i can do a video on

590
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.320
this i mean we've done videos that i
didn't want to make but i did it because

591
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.240
i'm paid so
you didn't want to do killing stalking

592
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.119
right yeah
that was rough that was before i was

593
00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:24.400
like really invested in doing the videos
though but

594
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.680
yeah that was the first one that came in
and i was like okay nick i'm paying you

595
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.800
and i was like
oh god

596
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.079
because like i couldn't get through the
i couldn't get i got through the first

597
00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:37.680
issue that was it i think you got
through the preview issue no i just i

598
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.000
read
i read the preview and i was like i'll

599
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.359
give the actual one a try because maybe
the pacing will kind of like help it out

600
00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:47.839
a little bit i'm like nope it's um yeah
no no

601
00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:52.240
um i think another one that i went into
it as kind of hesitant

602
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.480
to do was painter of the night
um

603
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.880
because i remember reading painter of
the night and being like yeah i'm not

604
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.520
gonna do a video about it yeah yeah i
remember that because like you kind of

605
00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.560
wanted to do a video better like cause
could i do anything like i guess and

606
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.800
you're like what about the sadism of
class and i'm like

607
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.440
and then i read and i'm like no james
there's stuff in here and you're like i

608
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.400
don't really know anymore and i was like
no james there's something here and

609
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.079
you're like i don't know and then we
kind of attached it to parasite we were

610
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:21.839
like oh this is this like what happens
with our videos in our creative at our

611
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:25.280
like video making process processes
basically we like sort of have an idea

612
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.960
we watch a piece of media like what can
we do this with and then like someone

613
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.040
will like kind of like burst into
someone else's room sitcom style be like

614
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.800
i had this idea and then we'll just kind
of talk about the thing for like two

615
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.640
hours yeah um and in that process we
should start writing notes because we

616
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.400
say a bunch of really good [ __ ] about
the thing and then i sit down to write

617
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.400
and i'm like
what did we say again

618
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.160
well it's like i went in to write my
sections of the camp video today and i

619
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.240
was like wait nick what am i supposed to
write

620
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.440
[Laughter]
like this this and this i'm like oh oh

621
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.560
okay like um
for those of you who have like been

622
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.720
following us on like uh
the on the podcast last year and like

623
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.560
you know the live streams you know that
we had been planning a quote the anime

624
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.400
video
yeah um for a long time and so it was it

625
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.760
was just gonna be the anime video and
we're gonna talk about a bunch of

626
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.960
different anime stuff and every like
week or two would be kind of come back

627
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.160
to the drawing board and be like
what was this video supposed to be about

628
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.079
again well yeah it would always be like
what are we doing and then like i went

629
00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:32.000
like a different like gay meeting or
like different like shipping or like

630
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
yeah it was going to be about shipping
and then like that was the final

631
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.800
decision was okay the anime video is
gonna be about shipping and then i

632
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.400
started talking to like anime fans and
they were like

633
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.319
don't don't try and do it all in one
video like unless this is gonna be like

634
00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:51.359
a six or seven hour long video
and that's when it was like okay well

635
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:54.720
that's something like even like deep
into that it was it was just the anime

636
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.480
video we didn't really have it attached
to anything concrete and we struggled to

637
00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.599
really think like how do we group up
these enemies that we're talking about

638
00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:05.599
like what's the pattern and it's like it
just kind of sat on the board as like a

639
00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:08.319
bunch of like you know venn diagrams
yeah

640
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:11.359
and then it just started to literally
break apart and i was like okay well i'm

641
00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:14.720
gonna do banana fish as one because i
think there's you know the crime thing

642
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.319
works and then well i'm gonna do skate
as one and and it just started breaking

643
00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:22.480
apart and now there's number six coming
and given and a bunch of and attack on

644
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.040
titan and there's a bunch of n
eventually there will also be um a video

645
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.119
looking at um
the lesbian one oh uh revolutionary girl

646
00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:36.960
lieutenant yeah that sailor moon and
stuff like that the lesbian one

647
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.480
um i mean like the lesbians are defended
by calling it that because it really is

648
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.200
just a lesbian
which anime is that the lesbian one okay

649
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.720
i i got it
um

650
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.599
now i kind of want to do a video about
godzilla i don't know how the hell to do

651
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:55.040
one about godzilla but
um i mean like the thing about that is

652
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.359
that you don't like in terms of just
doing these stuff is that

653
00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:03.119
we have a niche which means there's no
point in us doing stuff that's been done

654
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:07.040
to death
and godzilla has been analyzed to death

655
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.119
for better and for worse so
like

656
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:15.040
unless we can like sort of come up with
a queer angle for godzilla that's

657
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.880
literally never been thought of before
which i don't think we can

658
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.800
well yeah because godzilla is a piece of
art that was well at least a lot of them

659
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.440
are pieces of art made with specific and
clear intents about what the what this

660
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.960
piece of media is meant to be yeah and
so if we sort of say like no actually

661
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.839
there's a reading where the monster is a
queer allegory it's like no it's not

662
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:36.400
because that was absolutely not the
intention we are not death of the

663
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.280
authoring this [ __ ] yeah
but uh

664
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.079
niche
okay i tried to bring it back to that

665
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:46.400
because i'm talking about like niche
guys we don't want to do stuff that's

666
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.319
been overdone
cause like another one that i really

667
00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:54.319
didn't want to do was hannibal really i
had no interest in doing a video on

668
00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:57.440
hannibal until i watched the show oh
yeah i was super interested in doing

669
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.960
that because like i was a bit i was
closer to the shipping community of

670
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.280
hannibal and i'm like no apparently like
it's really gay yeah like i i had listen

671
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.640
my mom was a huge fan of hannibal before
you even watched it

672
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.280
like i i had watched a bunch of uh
listen to a bunch of podcasts with brian

673
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.760
fuller and stuff so i knew the gist of
hannibal and and the politics behind it

674
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.560
yeah i knew all of that before i even
watched the show

675
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.480
um and i knew that it ended on a
cliffhanger and and all of that stuff

676
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.560
that it got literally um that it got
cancelled in the middle and all this

677
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.800
stuff and then there was supposed to be
a fourth season specifically was really

678
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.280
leaning into the gay stuff and being
very public about like yeah it was

679
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.560
really hard not to do gay stuff and hugh
dansy said nothing

680
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.280
so like i knew all of that but like then
i watched the show and i was like oh

681
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.520
this is brilliant yeah yeah um
food porn

682
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:52.079
oh my god yes like i i i will admit to
our lovely patrons that i had erotic

683
00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:55.920
dreams about animal teaching to cook

684
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.920
very strong erotic fantasies about
hannibal teaching it wasn't like it was

685
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.480
like erotic cooking it was just like you
know regular cooking because max

686
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.480
michaelson has a very beautiful voice
and it's just like cooking

687
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.680
just like you know just being in the
room being like i'm comfortable with

688
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.880
this
i don't care who he's serving me like

689
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.880
god
comfortable

690
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.610
[Laughter]

691
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.079
oh lord um
but yeah and that's something that i bet

692
00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:31.119
the niche thing is something that i've
really been thinking of a lot lately

693
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:36.480
because what that's sticky
he was playing with a roll of gauze yeah

694
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.480
yeah okay it was the gauze that was
sticky not anything else um talking

695
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.319
about erotic cooking so yeah yeah i want
to clear the air

696
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.720
yeah
uh but i've been thinking about the

697
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.560
niche thing a lot lately because like
i'm very comfortable in my youtube niche

698
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.079
uh like i said like i think it's a a
niche that i'm comfortable with i think

699
00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:57.520
it's a niche that works and i think it's
a niche that is ever expanding because

700
00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.359
there's a queer reading of everything
yeah um well but i think i mean i've

701
00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:04.319
ever explained i think you mean like
there's like not a shortage of content

702
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.880
for like
ever expanding i don't mean ever

703
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.359
explaining like do you think there is
going to be a glass ceiling where we're

704
00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:13.040
just going to like sort of exhaust the
niche

705
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.440
i think at some point we might hit like
a subscriber ceiling but i don't think

706
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.640
we're going to run out of oh that's good
i'm not surprised about that whatsoever

707
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.760
because you know disney's going to keep
being disney so i mean

708
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:29.599
you you came at me quite a bit last year
saying like

709
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:33.119
asking like are you going to run out of
things to talk about

710
00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:37.760
and i was like no everything's gay
uh i think that was back before we

711
00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.920
really had the format of kind of
analyzing culture by proxy of media

712
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.440
which is opens up a lot more doors
because it lets us kind of talk at least

713
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.920
that we had
real life because it was

714
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.440
it was because this was back when it was
just like i'm going to talk about how

715
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.359
horror is gay no it was it was when we
did two disney videos in a month yeah

716
00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:58.560
and you that's when you thought we were
that we were going to run out of things

717
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.720
to talk about
um

718
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.920
i think i was also just kind of burnt
out because i wrote my ass off for those

719
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.280
things so
but um

720
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.359
that was last june i believe um
but yeah a big thing that i've been fo

721
00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:16.560
thinking about niche
lately because like i said i'm very

722
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.160
comfortable with the youtube niche um
is telos

723
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:28.960
because telos is has been developed as a
niche product being you know queer films

724
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.520
by queer people for queer people
um

725
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.520
and so it is like
the conception of it is niche and like

726
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:43.440
the challenge that i have given myself
and us for telos is that like making

727
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.920
very niched content about you know
literal gay vampires uh lesbian revenge

728
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.000
movie um like you know these things that
are you know they seem like it wouldn't

729
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.079
be accessible outside the queer
community and sort of making them

730
00:47:56.079 --> 00:48:00.000
narratively anne rice laughs in her
grave at literal gay vampires not being

731
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.760
accessible outside the queer community
um

732
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.040
well this is very explicitly gay whereas
sometimes with anne she was a little bit

733
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.440
more soft sometimes sometimes yeah she
was the vampire armand was not subtle

734
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.240
yeah um but like i actually want to have
explicitness in the in the vampire we're

735
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.520
doing and the vampire vampire stuff um
and sort of separate like have gay

736
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.680
vampires but separate vampires from like
gayness yeah uh at the same time so like

737
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.280
you know like we're doing something that
is a little bit niche um and rice really

738
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.079
tricked you into not thinking these
things were gay until you really

739
00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:36.559
couldn't really deny it anymore um
because it's like oh like victorian

740
00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:41.680
vampires it wasn't victorian it was
probably more no victorian yeah yeah um

741
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.720
so it's like okay well lestat was
further back he was in the 1700s yeah

742
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.480
that was like post-french revolution
right uh pre-revolution okay so that

743
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.079
would be the mid-1700s
um there were like three consecutive

744
00:48:54.079 --> 00:48:58.079
french revolutions and the third one
actually worked yeah um

745
00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:04.480
but yeah so like tell us innately has a
niche yeah and it's like

746
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.000
but it's the same thing as like okay
what kind of movies do you make

747
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.400
it's like saying like
well wes craven was just a niche

748
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.920
filmmaker because he made horror movies
and it's like

749
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.440
yeah
and redefined that niche multiple times

750
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.880
and that's that's what i mean like i was
getting around to my point eventually uh

751
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.240
was um
uh that you know like the challenge

752
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.839
limit i've given myself is making them
narratively and visually enticing enough

753
00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:35.680
that straight people will want to watch
them regardless yeah because for a long

754
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.720
time african-american cinema was
considered very niche but then movies

755
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.280
like the the jordan peel movies come out
and white people are lining up around

756
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.240
the block to see them and it's like
yeah it's only niche when you don't

757
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.839
think it could possibly apply to you
yeah when when you look at it and you're

758
00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:57.359
like i have no interest in that and i
will never be interested in that then

759
00:49:57.359 --> 00:50:00.960
it's niche and then niche is kind of
like a bad word yeah it's like oh that

760
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.319
little that little thing over there your
little your pet project so like i'll

761
00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:08.079
know that we'll know that we've made it
if we ever get people asking us when

762
00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:11.280
we're gonna make movies about straight
people

763
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.000
i'm already being asked that we haven't
even put a final girl yet oh my god

764
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.520
who's asking you that just like random
people in comments and stuff

765
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.839
sorry we're gonna have have to have
straight people in our movies yeah by

766
00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:30.559
necessity
if we have to it's not a choice

767
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.040
well we gotta have antagonists somehow
exactly

768
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.599
um
the villains they we need straight

769
00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:39.680
villains and there's another thing i
like i'm really excited to do with

770
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.319
taylor tillis
um is that i'm really excited to have

771
00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:48.480
gay villains like queer villains i'm
really excited to kind of be able to

772
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.359
depict that yeah um just by having
antagonistic queer characters there's

773
00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:57.200
multiple characters who are not the
villain

774
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.960
but are very gray yeah and or even
ambiguously antagonists

775
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.359
so i'm really excited to do that because
that's something that like mainstream

776
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:08.960
hollywood at large has been terrified to
do

777
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.599
oh yeah with the exception of a24
everything yeah everything everywhere

778
00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:19.839
all at once queer antagonist i loved it
queer antagonist and gray antagonist

779
00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:23.119
because jamie curtis's character ended
up actually being like i'm getting a

780
00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:25.920
tear in my eye because i'm remembering a
chill person

781
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.480
um like the whole thing
but um

782
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.960
it's it's
but like thinking like okay

783
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.960
is it possible for telos to get to the
point

784
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.599
where it is self-sustaining enough
that it can be a production company

785
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:50.240
and not just
a dream because right now it's gone it's

786
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.920
gone past dream because there's you know
there are a lot of investors in this

787
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.359
thing
but to be like a real production company

788
00:51:57.359 --> 00:52:01.359
there needs to be enough money there to
pay salaries yeah basically and not like

789
00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:05.839
our salaries but to have like a
production manager all the time people

790
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:09.280
on staff like someone who can you know
like

791
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.880
work with scripts and stuff eventually
like a lawyer like a lawyer and like

792
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.720
you know be able to buy scripts from
other people and things like that yeah

793
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.119
and i'm like will telos get big enough
because it is gay and it's like

794
00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:27.200
a part of me is like oh god i don't know
if it will because you know is would it

795
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.240
ever get big enough when people are not
about tyler perry

796
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.760
like well yeah but then like especially
like tyler perry starting out doing

797
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.680
independent theater and turning that
into independent movies and then turning

798
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.839
that into the empire the billion dollar
empire he has now

799
00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:45.040
um
it's an empire people live there yeah

800
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.280
they lived literally he built up he
built he built a town yeah he built a

801
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.839
town
um

802
00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:56.319
it's like old school hollywood where you
would actually like live in on the lot

803
00:52:56.319 --> 00:53:01.200
yeah like yeah like hollywood was a
subdivision for the actors to live in

804
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.839
yeah uh and then it just became what we
call the movie industry basically yeah

805
00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:08.720
um
even though the studios are spread out

806
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.520
the studios are in studio city they're
in burbank they're all over there

807
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.559
across they're across state lines like
yeah like some studios are in new york

808
00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:21.920
some of them are in disney has offices
in florida like

809
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.599
they're everywhere but
um you know that thought of will telos

810
00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:30.400
get big enough to be a thing other than

811
00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:37.200
a hobby because like right now my hope
for telos right now is that it will make

812
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.079
enough money
that

813
00:53:40.079 --> 00:53:45.680
the 80 000 that was raised
can basically continually cycle yeah

814
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:51.440
turn it over turn over in itself um
you know that's not profit that's

815
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.839
cycling to make a new movie
self-sustaining yeah well

816
00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:59.760
self-sustaining production is
self-sustaining yeah yeah but actually

817
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.760
running it as a business isn't
self-sustaining um my hope is that

818
00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.040
production can be self-sustaining so
that we can put out more movies and more

819
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.920
movies and then you never know which one
hits it big you don't know which one

820
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.800
will be my big fat greek wedding my big
fat gay wedding yeah um a big fat gay

821
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:20.319
wedding oh please say it ain't so
james you've tainted the world

822
00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:24.880
you have put hey that was a good movie i
like that big fat k wedding yeah big fat

823
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.240
greek wedding no greek wedding yes but a
gay wedding big fat gay wedding i do not

824
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.559
want that no but i'm just saying i do
not want that big fat greek wedding was

825
00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:37.599
a good movie no i yes yes but just i we
are going to get you have put it out

826
00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:41.599
into the world the gods and the fates
have responded and now conspiring and

827
00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:45.839
weaving the threat of fate and now we
are going to have my big fat gay wedding

828
00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:49.200
and it is going to be the worst thing in
the world

829
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.319
anyway not necessarily
i know like what if it was robin

830
00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:58.000
williams and nathan lane like cancer is
probably worse than my big fat gay

831
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.760
wedding um but anyway um
you know you never know what will be the

832
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.440
thing that hits and that's why i don't
want to be like

833
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.160
okay um i'm kidding someone proposed to
be pleased put everything into you know

834
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.000
the one box like okay final girl that's
the movie we're doing it's no there's a

835
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.480
lot and that's why like
uh we were talking with a friend of mine

836
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:25.359
who's uh working in and on uh final girl
with us

837
00:55:25.359 --> 00:55:29.920
um
and uh her husband has been

838
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.359
has worked in the film industry in the
past and he kind of pointed out you know

839
00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:36.799
80 000 doesn't go really far when you're
making a movie because you need permits

840
00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:40.319
and you need licenses and et cetera et
cetera et cetera and then i talked to

841
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:44.400
some people i know who currently work in
the film industry in

842
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.400
new one in new york and one in hollywood
and they were like

843
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.839
oh no you run and gun that [ __ ] yeah you
pay your actors

844
00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:56.400
and you buy them food and you run in
there you get your shot and you get out

845
00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.880
well it's like how did robert rodriguez
make his first movie for 200 2 500

846
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.200
yeah like you know and it's like and i
kind of got a little upset at that abs

847
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.000
insistence necessarily at her but just
the idea that like we need to do this

848
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.760
above the board and it's like we need to
do it above the board as possible yeah

849
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:18.079
but like we did not raise 80 000
promising a slate of movies only to get

850
00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:22.160
on one or two on a on a short film like
that is yeah because like the eighty

851
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.319
thousand dollars
really if we went completely like above

852
00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:31.040
board like got the lawyers we need for
permits like all of that

853
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.440
you get a short film yeah even then some
budgets for short films are much much

854
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.359
higher there are short films that do
crack six figures yeah on budgets which

855
00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:42.559
is insane and not even professional
special effects like apparently like

856
00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:45.680
what you were saying about like the
permits is like not only

857
00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.920
could that get incredibly incredibly
expensive but it takes a lot of time it

858
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.640
takes an incredible amount of time
because the government's especially with

859
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.720
a move because the way they work a lot
of times is that they say oh you want to

860
00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:01.200
shoot on x piece of property we want to
read the script yeah and then they read

861
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.760
the script
and if the person reading the script

862
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.680
doesn't like gay people
you can't shoot there yeah and like i

863
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.720
forget who said it um it may have been
robert rodriguez actually um

864
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:19.359
when making a movie always uh never ask
for permission ask for forgiveness later

865
00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:24.319
i think don't ask for permission ask for
forgiveness is like an old like italian

866
00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:27.040
at a dodge

867
00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:32.880
um
but like do you shop at target target

868
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.400
was that not a should that be a joke in
shit's creek like that target

869
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.070
oh thanks i got this at target
um

870
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:44.799
[Laughter]
but yeah so

871
00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:49.200
i don't want to take you know that
indiegogo money and be like okay we're

872
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.359
gonna do everything the right way and
then it makes a short film that may or

873
00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:56.799
may not well yeah this is what it is
this money is going to creators this

874
00:57:56.799 --> 00:58:01.119
money is going to developing content
it's not going to pay the government

875
00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:05.920
yeah that's what it's not doing actors
it's paying artists it's paying queer

876
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.440
people it is not going to go to line the
pockets of some especially small tier

877
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.319
bureaucrats in an office because the
government does so little to fund and

878
00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:21.359
sort of subsidize arts and they just
especially around here yeah so it's like

879
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:26.000
i'm not anti-taxes
no i'm not anti-you know anti-government

880
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.079
am i'm not libertarian it's just like
when it comes to creating these things

881
00:58:30.079 --> 00:58:36.480
they are expensive they require a lot of
talent when you are in the startup phase

882
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.559
i think you need to be willing to
break some rules

883
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:43.599
and as long as breaking those rules
doesn't hurt anyone

884
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:46.799
then that's fine because like after you
demonstrate that you can develop quality

885
00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:49.599
content you know then people are like oh
we'll give you money it's like but you

886
00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:53.040
need to deliver
you need the content no one's going to

887
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.559
take your word for it that you can do
something so something's got to give

888
00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:59.680
either you blow a whole bunch of money
to demonstrate that you can do things

889
00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:03.119
above the board or
you bend the rules a little bit to

890
00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:06.880
demonstrate that you can do stuff while
bending the rules and say like hey i did

891
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.720
this while playing outside of the out
outside of the fence imagine which

892
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.480
project didn't get any permits oh yeah
imagine what i could do

893
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.160
if blair witch project had the producers
of blair witch project had to pay fines

894
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.799
later
but they had made a quarter of a billion

895
00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:24.240
dollars so they're like here's your
couple of brands

896
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.079
by the time these things are large
enough to get on the radar of you have

897
00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:33.839
the money to pay the fines yeah yeah um
and so like so i've been kind of really

898
00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:36.960
focused on you know will we get big
enough and everything will the niche

899
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.760
work and you know to close out the
podcast i just had this thought before

900
00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.359
we started recording and i think it's a
good way to end the podcast because we

901
00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:49.760
are at just about over an hour now
goodness um

902
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:55.680
is that we are niche
and i am enthusiastic about the fact

903
00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.319
that we are a niche and that people
some people will look and say like oh

904
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:06.880
that's that tiny thing for weird people
because 30 years ago

905
01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:12.319
nobody knew who iron man was yeah and
that's what i was iron man was very nice

906
01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:15.359
and that's what i said like when we got
like the avengers one i'm like i can't

907
01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:17.599
wait for them to start breaking into
things like moon night and you're like

908
01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:20.319
they'll never do that and i'm like why
not it's like because people don't know

909
01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:23.920
who united is like people didn't know
who captain america was people knew who

910
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.640
captain america was but they didn't
they've seen captain america but they

911
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.520
didn't know who steve rogers is they
didn't know who bucky barnes was because

912
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.559
i had that same theory about idea about
captain america before them like oh my

913
01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:36.160
god he's just like a root rah-rah
american exceptionalism and i read the

914
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.640
comics i'm like no he's one of my
favorite characters you know what else

915
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.799
was super
niche to the point of being ridiculously

916
01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:45.359
niche
space operas

917
01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:49.920
until george lucas made them not niche
so

918
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.640
not saying that we're gonna you know be
lucasfilm um

919
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.640
like
creators and because we have tapped into

920
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.040
this niche and it's being successful it
means that this niche is hungry and yeah

921
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.640
this poisonous seed plant needs to
propagate and we are the little

922
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.570
