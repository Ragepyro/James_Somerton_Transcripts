00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.650
Before we start the video I just want to give
a BIG thanks to the literal thousands of people

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.410
who have signed up for my patreon over the
last couple of days.

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.920
You guys are absolutely amazing and I love
you all.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.340
So from now on let’s just say all of my
videos are sponsored by my amazing patrons!

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.550
If you’d like to become a patron the link
is down in the description below.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.620
There’s going to be a whole lot more extra
content coming that way in the very near future.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.090
So don’t want to miss out.

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:45.160
Okay, now, let’s talk about this train wreck.

10
00:00:45.160 --> 00:01:06.929
So, I watched The Secrets of Dumbledore (twice)
so you don't have to.

11
00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.920
I wasn’t going to watch it, but my morbid
curiosity to see what Rowling had shat out

12
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.909
this time got the better of me.

13
00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.359
So I hunted around online for a watchable
video of… through entirely legal means.

14
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.780
And honestly, with the high quality of phone
cameras these days, I expect better from these

15
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.780
things.

16
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.649
Then sat down to watch the movie of which
critics have said:

17
00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.040
“A world full of wizards has never felt
less magical”

18
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.630
“A once-promising franchise hits bottom”

19
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.499
“The Secrets of Dumbledore is just trying
to get it over with”

20
00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:38.499
And

21
00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.170
“A franchise chore”

22
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.310
Lovely.

23
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490
And… not at all inaccurate.

24
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.369
Okay, so, full-on spoilers-synopsis ahead.

25
00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.369
But honestly…

26
00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.369
you’re not missing much.

27
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.539
The movie starts out with a quick scene between
Dumbledore and Grindelwald where Dumbledore

28
00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.319
states clearly, for the first time, that he
was in love with Grindelwald.

29
00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.209
He repeats this statement later on.

30
00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.200
All together this takes up six seconds of
screen time, which has been edited out for

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.349
the Chinese release.

32
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.349
Shocker.

33
00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.069
We then move on to our purveyor of Fantastic
Beasts, Newt Scamander as he, I think, assists

34
00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.930
with the birth of a magical lizard deer called
a qilin.

35
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.430
I say I think, because it was obvious that
the theater doors were open so I could only

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.030
make out about half the screen.

37
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.930
So baby qilin is born, then Newt is attacked
by Credence, of being expelled from other

38
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.290
Warner Bros movies fame, and the qilin is
kidnapped.

39
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.879
But luckily another qilin was born.

40
00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.879
Twinsies!

41
00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.879
What luck.

42
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.329
Meanwhile Jacob, back in full muggle mode
after, kind of being a part of the team at

43
00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.720
the end of the second movie, is recruited
by a fabulous witch named Lally, to come back

44
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.890
to the team again.

45
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.150
Even though he’d been on the team the last
time we’d seen him.

46
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.069
But so was Nagini and she just up and disappeared
too.

47
00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.640
Oh and apparently this movie only takes place
a year after the first Fantastic Beasts movie,

48
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.189
even though that took place in the 20s and
the final battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald

49
00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.319
is supposed to take place in 1945.

50
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.349
Anyway…

51
00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.900
Jacob joins the team and we meet up with the
bunch of misfits, led by Dumbledore who shows

52
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.969
off the fine jewelry that's stopping him from
being able to fight Grindelwald.

53
00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.010
That nonsense McMuffin introduced in the last
movie.

54
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.900
And then we find out that there’s a wizarding
world election going on.

55
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.590
Time to elect a new president of the whole
wizarding world.

56
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.769
There’s two candidates.

57
00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.650
A woman named Santos and a man named Tao.

58
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.319
Who are… not part of the plot at all, really.

59
00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.319
According to dialogue a qilin, which seems
to be pronounced differently outside the movie

60
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.680
but we’ll stick with this for now, had once
been used to pick the next wizarding world

61
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.700
big cheese, because qilins can sense goodness
in people.

62
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.540
That’s what makes them fantastic.

63
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.680
A fantastic beast, if you will.

64
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.690
We’re left to assume that it's been centuries
since they’ve actually done that, but apparently

65
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.799
they’re going back to basics this time around.

66
00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.799
Kind of.

67
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:01.799
We’ll get to it.

68
00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.799
Sort of.

69
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.840
So at a big event for the nominees, it's announced
that Grindlewald has been pardoned of all

70
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.380
his past crimes, and so now he can run for
president of the wizarding world too.

71
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.380
And why wouldn’t he?

72
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.620
He has an army of dedicated followers.

73
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.020
But isn’t it up to the qilin to make the
decision?

74
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.260
So, things go south and the team is broken
up into multiple teams, which is always smart,

75
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.510
under the pretense of confusing Grindelwald,
who now has the qilin.

76
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.840
But he kills It and reanimates it so it will
bow to him come time for the election.

77
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.530
Which moves us into the second act, which
I’m not going to describe because it’s

78
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.670
damn well pointless.

79
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.890
The whole of the second act doesn’t need
to happen.

80
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.100
Nothing takes place that really changes things,
other than Credence finding out that he's

81
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.950
not Dumbledore's kid or brother, but he IS
a Dumbledore.

82
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.150
His dad was Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth.

83
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.440
Who was getting it on with some girl in the
village.

84
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.980
But Credence barely exists in this movie so
who the hell cares?

85
00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.030
Basically the second act is for action scenes
and lots of slow motion to entertain the kiddies.

86
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.430
And a crab walk.

87
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.220
Seriously, there was like 15 minutes of this
movie that could have been replaced with Zoidburg.

88
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.970
Going into the third act, our group of heroes
are once again sent on a mission, each of

89
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.140
them carrying a copy of Newt's magical briefcase,
one of which contains the living qilin.

90
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.030
This way Grindelwald’s goons won’t know
which briefcase to snatch.

91
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.040
How does Grindelwald know there’s even a
second qilin to begin with?

92
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.630
Magic.

93
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.680
He does a magic thing and sees that there’s
another one.

94
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.690
Or might be another one.

95
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.690
Maybe.

96
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.690
He’s not sure.

97
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.610
So everyone convenes in Bhutan, where the
election will take place.

98
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.540
High-jinx ensues until it's time for the qilin
to pick its person, who ends up being Grindelwald,

99
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.540
of course.

100
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.010
But newt is having none of it.

101
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.850
He says there’s another qilin, the living
one, but he can’t find it so he can’t

102
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.850
prove it.

103
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.370
Because nobody has the briefcase with the
qilin in it.

104
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.170
So the wizards vote and Grindelwald becomes
president.

105
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.340
Which…

106
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.910
This movie is really bad for this.

107
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.380
But it likes to introduce things that have
never once been referenced in HER material

108
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.940
over the last 3 decades.

109
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.020
Where once upon a time you had the Ministry
of Magic, and then the American Congress of

110
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.080
Magic.

111
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.250
Apparently there is an… overlord of magic?

112
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.530
Who is elected to preside over all of wizardkind?

113
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.110
This is very fundamentally important worldbuilding
that you think would have been explored in

114
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.130
depth before now.

115
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.780
I know it’s been vaguely referenced but
we need to know this going into this movie.

116
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.830
I mean in narrative terms they needed an important
title for Grindelwald to try and win.

117
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.560
So SHE just… pulled something out of her
ass?

118
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.640
Nevermind that Grindelwald could organize
his followers into a militia and skip this

119
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.120
Batman V Superman Lex-Luthor-Esque scheme
so complicated that if you look at it the

120
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.820
wrong way it just completely falls apart.

121
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.730
But apparently this needed to be a political
drama.

122
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.370
And a spy thriller.

123
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.580
And a kids movie.

124
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.460
And an adventure movie.

125
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.590
And — right, a Fantastic Beasts movie.

126
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.220
Well, the qilin, as the fantastic mcguffin
of this movie, is… kinda… pointless?

127
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.870
Because in ages past, a qilin would bow before
a collection of candidates — thereby indicating

128
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.550
the most suitable one to become leader.

129
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.530
However, because peering into someone’s
soul is so pedestrian, wizards resorted to

130
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.120
the barbarism of democratic elections instead.

131
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.590
And while they’re still having an election
(not even a secret ballet because reasons),

132
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.050
Grindelwald is also going to bring a qilin
for extra measure.

133
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.530
Even though it’s abundantly clear he has
a strong voter base that is growing by the

134
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.530
minute.

135
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.680
Not only based on dialogue in the previous
two installments, but also indicated by a…

136
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.020
kind of attempted assassination attempt on
him?

137
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.180
Or one of the other candidates by the twinkiest
wizard since before Daniel Radcliffe had chest

138
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
hair?

139
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.710
But even then, not really because Lally yeets
the poison out the window anyway.

140
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.650
But bear in mind the qilin’s verdict is
not binding.

141
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.530
Wizards and witches can still cast a vote
for whomever.

142
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.530
So…

143
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.460
there’s a possibility that the qilin could
tell the populace that someone is perfect

144
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.640
for the job, and then they won’t vote for
them anyway?

145
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.610
Does the qilin choose the leader, or do the
people?

146
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.050
This seems only slightly less unnecessarily
complicated than our ‘muggle’ method of

147
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.030
determining the state of conflict and economy
in the world, based on an election in Ohio

148
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.170
every four years.

149
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.970
I’m sorry, is this hard to follow?

150
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.710
Try sitting through a movie in which every
time a plot starts to materialize, there’s

151
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.810
a cut away to a character you had completely
forgotten about.

152
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.560
Anyway, Newt's assistant, the one who had
an obvious crush on him in the first two movies,

153
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.110
shows up with the real briefcase and out comes
the living qilin.

154
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:42.580
The other one dies for real and the living
one picks a new best leader…

155
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.580
Dumbledore.

156
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.000
Which is… a choice.

157
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.740
Excuse me for moralizing here, but Dumbledore
is not pure of heart.

158
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.520
Dumbledore was fully on board with subjugating
muggles when he was younger, was totally okay

159
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.220
with risking the lives of our Fantastic Beasts
heroes just to distract Grindelwald, and later

160
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.820
on in life would lead Harry Potter to the
slaughter in the war against Voldemort and

161
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.500
then, once Harry kinda died, told him he didn’t
need to go back and could just let his friends

162
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.800
take care of all the fighting from now on.

163
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.690
That, to me, does not describe someone who
is pure of heart.

164
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.690
Back to the story.

165
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.850
Dumbledore refuses and the qilin picks the
woman who was running instead.

166
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.320
Grindelwald is pissed and is about to kill
her, I think, but Credence steps in front

167
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320
of him.

168
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.030
He says screw it and launches a killing curse
at Credence, but both Dumbledore and Aberforth

169
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.260
launch protection spells, which intersect
with the killing curse and destroy the magical

170
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.360
McMuffin stopping Dumbledore and Grindelwald
from fighting… somehow.

171
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.790
So the gays jump into their own little magical
pocket dimension and have a wand fight for

172
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.860
a few seconds, inching closer together each
time they dodge a spell, and eventually end

173
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.690
up with their hands over each other’s heart.

174
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.090
How sweet.

175
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.170
Dumbledore walks away as Grindelwald asks:
“Who will love you now, Dumbledore?”

176
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.830
Then we leave the magical pocket dimension
and everyone has their wands pointed at Grindelwald,

177
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.570
but he zips away and the movie ends.

178
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:07.820
There’s a denouement where literally everyone
has coupled up except Dumbeldore, who is now

179
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.170
the sad lonely gay.

180
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.510
Wonderfully positive representation.

181
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.460
It essentially leaves us at exactly the same
place we were at the end of the last movie.

182
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.130
Grindelwald is on the run, our team is no
closer to catching him, still over a decade

183
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.770
from the big final battle between him and
Dumbledore, and two more hours of our lives

184
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.770
lost.

185
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.360
Oh except Aberofroth is going to take in his
abandoned son, Credence, because Credence

186
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.900
is dying now apparently.

187
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.680
And now Dumbledore doesn’t have the magical
jewelry anymore.

188
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.630
Which he shouldn’t have in the first place
because it was just stupid.

189
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.270
So that’s the plot of this…

190
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.850
I hesitate to call it a movie.

191
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.350
It felt more like multiple filler episodes
of a tv show.

192
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.980
Like a network tv show, not even a cable one.

193
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.880
Obviously I’m not a fan, which is kind of
a relief.

194
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.190
Because I don’t even have to pretend not
to like it because Rowling is TERFy trash.

195
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.980
I legitimately don’t like it!

196
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.480
Of course I haven’t been a big fan of anything
she’s written since 2007 so I shouldn’t

197
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.830
really be shocked by this.

198
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.550
To be fair there are some good performances
here, especially from Jude Law and Mads Mickelson,

199
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:14.520
but as described, the movie has a myriad of
flaws… from bad pacing, meandering direction,

200
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.840
an aimless plot, and no real story progression.

201
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.230
And it’s egregious habit of telling us things
it should be showing us.

202
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.870
Film is a visual medium.

203
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.350
Do not tell me about something that happened
in the long long ago.

204
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.270
SHOW me it happening.

205
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.050
That is, like, one of the first things you
learn in film school.

206
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.730
“Show Don't Tell” is THE code of good
filmmaking.

207
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.420
Any good writer knows this.

208
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.779
Any director worth their damn salt would have
the script rewritten to make this happen.

209
00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.940
But oooh we can’t rewrite Joanne’s script.

210
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.940
It’s gospel.

211
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.110
It was sent down from on high, etched in stone
tablets and carried down the mountain by unpaid

212
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.110
house elves.

213
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.360
But the thing that stood out the most to me,
which I don’t know if this was done on purpose

214
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.490
or by mistake, is the complete lack of canonical
coherence.

215
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.279
Not only to HER very own IP which she lately
has lovingly constructed with the help of

216
00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:13.250
lifting details from fanfiction… but specifically
regarding Grindelwald’s real-world inspiration.

217
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:20.350
Grindelwald, ever since his introduction,
has been seen as the magical world’s equivalent

218
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.520
to Hister.

219
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.760
Fans even jokingly nicknamed him Wizard Hister.

220
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.710
So if you’re following that progression,
this movie shouldn’t have involved any magical

221
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.710
lizard-deer.

222
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.480
(The powers of which are slightly different
than in Chinese mythology.

223
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.970
But hey — when has Rowling ever NOT used
and changed the myths of other cultures for

224
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.190
her own means?)

225
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.610
It should have been a straight up, three-way
election in which Grindelwald secures a plurality

226
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.610
of the votes.

227
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.300
Putting him in power even though the majority
don’t want him there.

228
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.430
Mirroring Hister’s own rise to power in
the 1930s.

229
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.920
Because, the way the movie portrays it, people
are all on board for him being in control

230
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.720
until the deer lizard says otherwise, and
then they change their mind once they know

231
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.960
that he's corrupt.

232
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.420
And sadly, that’s not how elections work.

233
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.900
For instance, Donald Trump’s supporters
didn’t abandon him when they found out about

234
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.870
the horrible things he’d done.

235
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:20.580
In fact Trump got about 12 million MORE votes
in 2020 than he did in 2016.

236
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.650
A lot of people weren’t turned off by his
authoritarian tendencies, they actively preferred

237
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.650
them.

238
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.080
They wanted a strong-man leader.

239
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.060
And they actively decried any proven instance
of him lying as fake news.

240
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.230
Even when he was caught bald-faced lying on
camera, his supporters actively rejected it.

241
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.300
On some… psychological level they could
not accept truth.

242
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.480
Meanwhile, the wizarding world runs on this
after school special logic where truth and

243
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.880
justice wins over the masses.

244
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880
Apparently.

245
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.961
Grindelwald actually does fit the Hister and
Trump comparison in one way though, because

246
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:59.800
he has gained his following by spurring on
a class of people who perceive themselves

247
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.920
to be subjugated: wizards who are sick of
having to hide their wizardness.

248
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.970
Or Arian Germans and the white working class
in real life.

249
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.730
These tyrannical types use these people as
a stepping stone to gain power, and they always

250
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.190
have a scapegoat.

251
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:20.161
Trump blamed everyone who wasn’t white,
Hister blamed Jews, Roma, gays, the disabled,

252
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:23.860
and basically everyone who didn’t fit his
idea of ideal human.

253
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.630
And Grindelwald used Muggles.

254
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.170
But there’s a difference.

255
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.060
Wizards actually are kind of subjugated, and
do have to hide..

256
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.750
But by using this deer-lizard, and then having
Grindelwald lose the election, you’re obscuring

257
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.029
the Hister allegory, which has been driving
the interest in Grindelwald as Wizard Hister

258
00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:44.750
since 2007.

259
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.520
But if we start talking about allegory, there’s
another problematic angle.

260
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.420
Since Grindelwald is actually gay, or at least
that’s what we’ve been lead to believe,

261
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.040
we’re kind of in a sticky situation where
two heterosexuals, Rowling and screenwriter

262
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.350
Steve Kloves, are dictating who is a good
gay, and who is a bad gay.

263
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.750
In Rowling’s Wizarding World is seems that
she’s saying that Grindelwald is the bad

264
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.310
gay because he’s rocking the boat.

265
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.350
He’s demanding wizards have the right to
be seen, and stop hiding from muggles.

266
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.760
He’s demanding they be allowed to come out
to the closet, in a way.

267
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.630
Of course he also wants to subjugate, if not
enslave and kill muggles too, because Rowling

268
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.100
doesn’t have a subtle bone in her body.

269
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.250
But his basic argument of “wizards shouldn’t
have to hide” is one that actually reverberates

270
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.380
quite loudly among the queer community she,
and her followers, are currently doing their

271
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.630
best to demonize.

272
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.800
First, she and her followers came for trans
people.

273
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.770
And now, at least her followers, are coming
for gays and lesbians as well.

274
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.010
Claiming that we groom children with queer
YA books, or even mentioning the LGBTQ community

275
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.020
in schools.

276
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.630
Now, Rowling hasn’t said this herself.

277
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.060
But she has retweeted some people who have.

278
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.500
And if you go back a few years her crusade
against trans people began exactly the same

279
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.520
way.

280
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:04.370
Retweeting TERFs and transphobes long below
vocalizing her own ignorance and hate.

281
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.440
So whose to say the gays aren’t next on
her chopping block?

282
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.300
Rowling is now throwing her lot in with people
who accuse gay men and women who support trans

283
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.680
rights of ‘grooming’ children.

284
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.270
These groups of people are associated with
those who actively feel that any expression

285
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.170
of queerness must be kept away from kids.

286
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:29.209
Rowling, who once expressed herself as a staunch
ally, is now beginning to side with errant

287
00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:30.209
homophobes.

288
00:16:30.209 --> 00:16:36.020
For no other reason than siding with people
who share her bigoted opinions on trans people.

289
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.339
If Rowling is no longer comfortable throwing
herself into queer spaces, instead taking

290
00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:45.090
social calls with and retweeting homophobic
influencers…

291
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.300
could that be an indication that the cis queer
community she once sided with is now losing

292
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.029
it’s tolerance for transphobia?

293
00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:53.450
There’s a glass-half-full take on this.

294
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:59.640
That Rowling was procedurally pushed out of
queer-allied spaces because cis-folk (queer

295
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.420
or allies) would not tolerate her rhetoric.

296
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.699
So she HAD to turn to homophobes because nobody
else would tolerate her transphobic hateful

297
00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:10.049
opinions.

298
00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:16.339
But the glass-half-EMPTY takeon this is that
this is one of those reasons why queer people

299
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.339
can be a little bit…

300
00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.699
suspicious of allies.

301
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:25.659
Because Rowling’s compulsive hatred of trans
people is more important to her than her support

302
00:17:25.659 --> 00:17:27.470
of cis-gay people.

303
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:33.749
That she is willing to compromise her support
for gay people, but unwilling to compromise

304
00:17:33.749 --> 00:17:36.690
her own bigotry toward trans people.

305
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.789
Hating people is simply more significant for
her sense of self than loving people.

306
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:46.639
So… will she just turn on ANYONE who openly
supports trans people?

307
00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:51.779
Whom she openly accuses of being ‘dangerous
revolutionaries’ out to ‘invade’ and

308
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.500
‘disrupt’ womens’ spaces?

309
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.929
I mean… she HAS been writing a character
who is a dangerous revolutionary who is out

310
00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:02.809
to invade and disrupt wizarding spaces…

311
00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:03.809
However…

312
00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:08.630
while she demonizes the queer character who
calls for revolution, coming out, and an end

313
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:14.039
to the status quo (albeit in the most extreme
way possible), she does not demonize the other

314
00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:16.970
gay, who actually is a teacher.

315
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.210
Dumbledore.

316
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:24.289
But it's okay for Dumbledore to be a teacher
because although he WAS in love with Grindelwald,

317
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:26.530
he is not actively with him.

318
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:32.740
And she herself has said that after the love
affair ended he became something like asexual.

319
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.100
So basically gays are good, and are okay to
be around kids, as long as they don’t have

320
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.230
anything close to a sex life.

321
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.460
Celibate gays are fine.

322
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.909
The gays who are willing to keep hiding in
the closet are fine.

323
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:50.049
Dumbledore DID want to change the world, just
like Grindelwald.

324
00:18:50.049 --> 00:18:51.490
When he was younger.

325
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.120
But he's grown up, and matured out of that
mindset.

326
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.820
He doesn’t want to change things anymore.

327
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.429
Everything is fine as it is.

328
00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:02.279
He has his cushy job at Hogwarts, why call
for a revolution now?

329
00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:05.940
Of course I’m not saying that we should
be siding with a character who, up until a

330
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.230
few days ago, was a wizarding allegory for
Adolf Hister.

331
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:16.220
But it is interesting that it seems to be
rich wizards and wizard cops who are most

332
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.379
stressed out about the possibility of Grindelwald
coming to power, and not your average witches

333
00:19:21.379 --> 00:19:22.379
and wizards.

334
00:19:22.379 --> 00:19:28.390
We don’t really hear from them except when
we see them cheering on Grindelwald and carrying

335
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.489
him around like a conquering hero.

336
00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:34.600
So the spoken message and the visual message
seem disjointed.

337
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:41.179
We’re meant to hate and fear him, like Voldemort,
but it's not the 1990s anymore.

338
00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.989
The world has changed a lot.

339
00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:48.049
People are much more aware of “revolutionary”
thinking like trans rights, taxing the rich,

340
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:50.210
and getting rid of income inequality.

341
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.879
The heroes of today’s world are calling
for the change we need, while the villains

342
00:19:55.879 --> 00:20:03.600
are calling for the conservation of current
values, or even moving backward — regression.

343
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:10.049
So I just find it interesting that it's the
heroes of this film who want everything to

344
00:20:10.049 --> 00:27:46.369
stay the same, and the villains calling for
change.
