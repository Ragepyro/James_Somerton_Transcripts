00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
this video is brought to you by
Squarespace in 1996 the musical theater

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.519
world was changed Forever by a small
Off-Broadway musical gaining the

3
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.240
attention of critics and fans alike rent
was promptly moved to a proper Broadway

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.960
Theater where it quickly spread
throughout the whole world and for those

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.080
of us who have recently become
immunologists from spending the last

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
three years in a pandemic we know just
how fast a plague can spread without

7
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.359
protection namely much like kova 19 a
lot of people who didn't think it was

8
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.279
bad to begin with yes I am comparing
redheads to anti-masters see

9
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.300
I love drint focus on the past tense the
movie adaptation came out at the perfect

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.780
time for me I was in high school and
just started to take my future seriously

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.860
my dad had just won a decades-long fight
for workers compensation after breaking

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.860
his neck and back on the job so he
received a settlement that in hindsight

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.160
was nothing compared to what he was
actually owed which meant I got a

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520
digital video camera for Christmas I
could finally start making movies and

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.800
properly editing them I could work on my
art so when rent came out I heavily

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.380
identified
with Mark this was also at the peak of

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
Post 9 11 fears of a cataclysmic World
War III so that seemed to be a

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.100
possibility so the no day but today
messaging resonated with me quite deeply

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.920
when you have something you have to say
it's important to get it out into the

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.939
world now because there might not be a
tomorrow through rent however I was

21
00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.659
exposed to a wider range of theater and
began to see places where rent themes

22
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.979
were more clearly expressed Hedwig in
the anger inch while problematic I would

23
00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.220
argue knowingly but that's not a mole
hell I'm willing to die on seemed to

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420
just hold itself together in a way where
rents use and catchy songs and general

25
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
sentimentality helped you to ignore its
shortcomings and then baby gay James

26
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
begins to learn more about the AIDS
crisis and specifically what it was like

27
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.460
in the early 90s and late 80s and
yeah there are some issues about that

28
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.040
and then as someone who grew up and grew
their career while still holding on to

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.840
my artistic dreams okay Mark it really
can't be that hard to get your

30
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.140
together and through discussions with my
co-writer Nick who had nothing but

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.020
contempt for every aspect of the
production despite only knowing about it

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.720
through second-hand knowledge I began to
concede that the bigger picture themes

33
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.980
you know it was made by straight guy
with the best of intentions whose

34
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.040
objective was to depict the
deteriorating state of artistic Merit

35
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.480
that he had seen through the 1980s rent
was made to push against the trend of

36
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.959
corporatization in giuliani's
gentrification of New York City as well

37
00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.340
as a serenade for the bygone golden age
of Starving Artists through a

38
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
reimagining of blabo M in modern times
where we swap out consumption which was

39
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.459
likely tuberculosis for AIDS Larson
seeks to remind his audience of the

40
00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.140
importance and value of authenticity in
art and in turn the value of art itself

41
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.160
to society but that opens up a whole
bunch of questions about Mark's role as

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.940
the protagonist a question about what
art is how the nonsensical elements of

43
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.660
the plot fit into a representation of
social justice the behavior and morals

44
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.500
of the core cast in the context of early
1990s New York the representation of

45
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.860
queer characters the moral focus on the
effects of AIDS on straight people and a

46
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.220
question of how appropriate it is to
swap out tuberculosis for AIDS without

47
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.659
too much adaptation AZT break and then I
eventually got Nick to sit down and

48
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.860
watch the thing he hates as much as I
disagree with hate watching on Merit but

49
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.680
he wanted to be armed with information
if he was going to keep this discussion

50
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.500
going and sure he's not having a great
time but

51
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.980
oh God it's like watching your favorite
childhood movie as an adult and you just

52
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.099
spend the whole time cringing because
instead of just knowing how the songs

53
00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.580
vaguely fit into the context of play
seeing the actual interactions between

54
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.480
these people who are somehow framed
heroically and their sense of what the

55
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.920
world apparently owes them

56
00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.659
there's a lot to be desired for instance
Mark is offered a part-time job in his

57
00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.180
field that pays well above a living wage
especially for the time and then he

58
00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.620
quits because it's taking time away from
his own art take the other 20 hours a

59
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.379
week and make your dumb pretentious
documentary about your friend's Mark

60
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.200
your documentary isn't even about
anything you're not making it to be

61
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.480
consumed by an audience outside your
group of friends you're not even

62
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.739
recording sound this art documentary
offers nothing to humanity it has no

63
00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.579
value to culture because there is this
implicit belief in the late 80s that

64
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.060
making art for a mass audience somehow
diminishes its inherent authenticity

65
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.419
there's no reason you want to make it
except to stroke your own ego and call

66
00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.600
yourself an artist in spite of the fact
that you're allergic to criticism and

67
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.340
therefore are too afraid to actually
show it to anyone else no wonder Maureen

68
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.840
dumped you okay so in spite of the fact
that rent is deeply problematic in a way

69
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.900
that's easy to overlook because the
collection of identities are visibly

70
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.979
represented regardless of that it's
important as a work of theater because

71
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.400
it presented specifically queer
identities to a broad audience and

72
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.000
helped ease the general population into
appreciating these people where they

73
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.720
were depicted without rent swinging open
the doors we would not have had the kind

74
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.620
of representation we have now rent while
Troublesome paved the way for True

75
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.820
masterpieces of queer representation
namely Tony kushner's Angels In America

76
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.199
which while lacking an explicit
discussion of art itself it discusses

77
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.340
Ren's themes of inequality poverty
republicanism AIDS and cultural

78
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.560
disassociation in a much more subtle yet
targeted way this strangely comedic

79
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.180
Fantasia about death and rebirth the gay
state of being in late 80s America and a

80
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.720
culture on the precipice of great
Capital C change remains one of the most

81
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.800
celebrated pieces of theater in the
American Canon and for Angels in America

82
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.740
to fly I had argued rent needed to walk
hobble limp saunter and then you

83
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.780
actually have the moment of douge where
you need to fact check yourself and rent

84
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.759
properly premiered Off-Broadway in 1996
after being workshopped since 1993.

85
00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.419
workshopping is when you put the
production in front of test audiences

86
00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.080
and work out the Kinks before you put it
in front of the real audience part one

87
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.740
of Angels in America Millennium
approaches however

88
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.759
premiered in 1991
and part two parastroika premiered in

89
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.500
1992 and they were on Broadway by 93.
rent wasn't even out of the gate by the

90
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.620
time angels in America lapped it all
these years I thought rent was a

91
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.280
progenitor of queerness in theater and
meanwhile there went to gaiju making one

92
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.639
of the most significant additions to
Modern literary canon while being passed

93
00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.880
off as riding on rent's coattails what
do I do with this how do I reconcile

94
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.560
that if angels in America didn't need
rent to prop itself up then why rent at

95
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.400
all
and why rent when you can buy a

118
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.500
I know some of you don't like it when we
synopsisize the media under discussion

119
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.880
because spoilers but this is a
comparative analysis that takes into

120
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.200
consideration political economic and
social context so it's probably best

121
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.220
that I make my case clear when it comes
to what we're actually talking about but

122
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.680
specifically what is it about these
Productions that make it significant

123
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.700
that angels in America came first it's
important to show respect to

124
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.940
Trailblazers in representation even if
their representation doesn't age well

125
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.019
media that Stakes out new territory can
swing the door open for better

126
00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:14.580
representation and that's how I felt
rent's major purpose fit into our modern

127
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.440
media landscape messy but ultimately
palatable enough to large audiences to

128
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.820
broaden the spectrum of acceptance
enough to permit something like angels

129
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.440
in America to get into the world but
that clearly wasn't the case however

130
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.700
there are two claims here that I'm going
to need to back up with some textual

131
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.700
evidence one is that rent is
so-so on representation the other is

132
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.019
that rent is fundamentally palatable as
in it takes radical identities of the

133
00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:46.800
day and age queer people homeless people
and addicts and softens their

134
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.279
personalities and circumstances so that
it's easier for General audiences to

135
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:55.200
identify with them I see this as finding
a way to fit these people into the

136
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.399
societal Norm rather than challenging
the boundaries of the norm lean in

137
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.860
empathy and especially when it comes to
that I am liable to contradict myself

138
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.420
because rent is messy and a huge
component of why it's messy is the way

139
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.320
in which the audience interprets it and
the way these characters are framed

140
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.940
through Direction so what happens in
rent the plot of rent takes place over

141
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.279
the course of a single year 525 600
minutes to be exact and focuses on a

142
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.480
group of young
artists who are coping with the effects

143
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.200
of poverty addiction and HIV and AIDS
the story focuses on their hardships

144
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.100
their hopes and the relationships that
they build as they work through the

145
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.820
obstacles that life throws at them the
central characters are Mark Cohen an

146
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.420
aspiring filmmaker the show's narrator
and unwittingly the worst person on

147
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.560
Earth and Roger Davis a songwriter and
recovering addict the show begins on

148
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.560
Christmas Eve when the protagonists are
confronted with the possibility that

149
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.820
their landlord and former roommate Benny
May remove them from their apartment

150
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.720
since they haven't paid rent in a year
they triumphantly announce that they are

151
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.839
not going to pay rent because they're
all just so artistic and therefore they

152
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.959
shouldn't have to pay rent because
getting jobs will interfere with their

153
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:10.560
creative process Benny had once been
part of the group of starving artist

154
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.959
friends and is alluded to have once had
strong leftist political beliefs he has

155
00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:19.260
since married into money and opted to
purchase this building and the

156
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.040
neighboring property with the intent of
developing these Lots while he doesn't

157
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.300
have plans to develop the literal slum
that Mark and Roger live in he does want

158
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.100
to evict a homeless Camp to construct a
cyber Art Studio vocally expressing that

159
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.480
the goal is to offer unspecialized
employment to be fair while Benny had

160
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.680
once agreed to let Mark and Roger live
there rent free this is something he has

161
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.640
changed his mind on God forbid you have
to pay rent Roger who is haunted by the

162
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.779
suicide of his girlfriend struggles to
find inspiration for his music until he

163
00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:53.579
meets Mimi who instigates a very poorly
judged romance with him for a number of

164
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:57.959
reasons Roger is very resistant to her
flirtations namely because he's an

165
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.820
addict in recovery and basically every
addiction program mandates a solid year

166
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.920
of no new romantic attachments after
becoming sober meanwhile Mimi literally

167
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.540
sings a song about how it's okay to do
drugs in Roger's face and yet this is

168
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.260
the Romantic Duo the audience is meant
to be rooting for evidenced by the fact

169
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.680
that this romantic through line is the
closest thing to a plot that the play

170
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.820
has will they won't they I digress
attending the squatters Christmas party

171
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.320
is Tom Collins a good-natured professor
of philosophy in the digital age he is

172
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.459
assaulted for unknown reasons on his way
to Mark and Rogers and encounters Angel

173
00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:36.180
who helps him get back up to his feet
sparking the start of their romance

174
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.140
Angel is surely one of the only likable
characters in the play which says

175
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.320
something given that the first thing
that they do in the play is kill a dog

176
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.339
Benny's dog the two show up to the party
as a couple and remain that way until

177
00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:51.839
angel passes away in a pivotal moment in
the second act with much anticipation we

178
00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:55.260
meet Mark's ex-girlfriend Maureen
Johnson who is an eccentric and

179
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.040
self-obsessed performance artist as well
as her new girlfriend Joanne Jefferson

180
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.620
who is a no-nonsense lawyer Joanne is
clearly a bit of a masochist too or else

181
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.740
she would have left Maureen within five
minutes of meeting her Maureen is also

182
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.639
bisexual which means that she's a
apparently because bisexuals apparently

183
00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:15.000
have too many options and so they can
never be trusted to keep it in their

184
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.519
pants
apparently of the aforementioned

185
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:21.899
characters four are HIV positive Roger
Mimi Angel and Collins throughout the

186
00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:25.260
musical these characters also face the
harsh realities of poverty illness and

187
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.980
loss they confront the stigma and
challenges of poverty while cherishing

188
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.459
their friendships until they all decide
to hate each other when Angel dies and

189
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:36.540
Roger and Mimi break up and Mark quits a
ridiculously high paying job because it

190
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.139
isn't his art
and he doesn't have time to wait context

191
00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:44.579
Mark is one of the people not living
with HIV or Aids or addiction so he has

192
00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:48.660
absolutely zero swords owned by Damocles
hanging over his head but he is a

193
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.839
straight white man so he deserves things
in the show's conclusion everyone

194
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:55.139
reconciles the differences because Mimi
almost dies from a combination of drug

195
00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:59.160
overdose weather exposure in December
and what is alluded to be Advanced stage

196
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.839
AIDS but Roger sings the worst song to
her and she comes back to life and then

197
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:06.540
they watch the documentary that Mark's
been making over the last year about his

198
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.600
friends a documentary which he has
recorded with no sound equipment so it's

199
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.740
basically just a slideshow highlight
reel of the show which we've just

200
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.800
watched kind of like what I just made
you go through but without the pithy

201
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.360
commentary but that said I feel a little
bad being so critical of rent primarily

202
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.500
because it isn't all bad rent hit the
pavement running at a time when having

203
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.980
any kind of queerness was something that
according to censors opt to have been

204
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.940
kept out of media Brent was bold about
topics around sex and sexuality and

205
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.260
featured Collins a character with AIDS
holding on to dreams about his future

206
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.180
however the problem I have here is not
so much with rent itself but a question

207
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.459
of why it's still put on this pedestal
by many with angels in America while

208
00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:52.260
Angels In America which checks those
same boxes is

209
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.180
not nearly as widely known
especially when I would hold angels in

210
00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.660
America in much higher esteem
[Music]

211
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.040
Tony kushner's Play Angels in America
was a game changer when it premiered in

212
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.240
San Francisco in 1991. the play takes
place in New York City during the

213
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.320
mid-1980s during the height of the AIDS
epidemic The Seven Hour production is

214
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.279
broken up into two sections which are
titled Millennium approaches and

215
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:24.300
perestroika Millennium approaches
establishes the characters and how their

216
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.680
lives are intertwined as well as sets up
the magic realism that props up the

217
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.880
allegorical side of what the AIDS crisis
was doing to America we are introduced

218
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.440
to Pryor Walter a gay man of lineage
that can be traced back all the way to

219
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.180
the crossing of the Mayflower and Beyond
story opens he Reveals His AIDS

220
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.959
diagnosis while he's handling it well
especially given what life with AIDS

221
00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:50.220
meant in the late 1980s his boyfriend
Louis ironson struggles with the fear

222
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.180
and responsibility of having to care for
a sick partner the play also introduces

223
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.639
us to Joe Pitt a closeted Mormon lawyer
who is being groomed by Roy Cohn to be a

224
00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:04.500
pawn in a game of political chess Joe's
wife is Harper who is dealing with

225
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.300
severe mental illness and is being
severely gas lit by Joe she has begun to

226
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.199
suspect that in light of her husband's
complete lack of sexual interest in her

227
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:18.540
he is in fact a homosexual we see the
impact that aids has had on society

228
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.079
throughout the course of Millennium
approaches as well as the fear and shame

229
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.560
that surround the epidemic and the
political inaction regarding the crisis

230
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.459
the characters are forced to come to
terms with their own mortality as well

231
00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:33.360
as the unpredictability of the future
unable to withstand the pressure of

232
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.380
being directly confronted with the
reality of AIDS Lewis leaves prior while

233
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.300
he is unconscious in the hospital
something that prior doesn't really let

234
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.959
him live down the play isn't wrong in
having prior state that Lewis is leaving

235
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:49.860
is a bitter pill to swallow partners of
AIDS victims usually stuck it out until

236
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.880
the very end something that the rest of
the world should have seen as a

237
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.019
testament to the loyalty and compassion
that we queer people were accused of not

238
00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:01.680
possessing in the absence of Lewis
prior's old drag friend and nurse

239
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.120
believes steps in to pick up the slack
he is aside from one of the takeaway

240
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.720
characters of the show pivotal in
challenging the play's principal villain

241
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.919
Roy Cohn Belize is assigned to attend to
Roy as he dies of AIDS which is being

242
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:17.459
exasperated by the cancer treatment he
insists on taking to protect his

243
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:21.839
reputation as a passing for straight
Republican shark lawyer all the while he

244
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:26.280
loses his mind and is haunted by the
literal ghosts of his morally bankrupt

245
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.179
past as Roy tries to convince his
Protege Joe to relocate to Washington

246
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:34.320
the Mormon struggles with his wife
Harper The Strain on this relationship

247
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.000
is spurring him to dive deeper and
deeper into his repressed homosexual

248
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.380
urges this leads him to cross paths with
Lewis a word processor for Soulless

249
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.280
lawyers like himself Joe Falls
completely in love with Lewis who is on

250
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.360
the rebound and who also has no idea
that Joe Works directly under the living

251
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.440
embodiment of gay evil Harper is taken
in by Joe's mother Hannah an eluded

252
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.120
closeted lesbian who crosses paths with
prior by then Pryor has already started

253
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.440
seeing slash hallucinating visitations
from Angels bestowing messages for him

254
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.880
to prophesy unto mankind amidst a full
psychological meltdown he turns to

255
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.780
whomever he's able to to give him
answers he finds those answers at the

256
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.400
Mormon Community Center where Hannah is
volunteering this strange Duo ends up

257
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.419
becoming a curious pair Hannah is
implied to also have interactions with

258
00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:25.620
angels truly questioning if Pryor is
actually seeing Angels or not because

259
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.940
Belize is a nurse in the AIDS Ward where
Roy Cohn is receiving AZT an

260
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.299
experimental new AIDS drug still in
double-blind trials and therefore nearly

261
00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:38.760
impossible to attain he sees Joe through
prior word gets back to Lewis who

262
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.919
confronts Joe who we learned was cohn's
right-hand man for some truly abominable

263
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:47.880
legal actions love the one where you
found against those women on Staten

264
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.020
Island who were suing the New Jersey
Factory the toothpaste makers whose

265
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.919
orange colored smoke was blinding
children blind just minor irritation

266
00:18:55.919 --> 00:19:00.240
three of them had to be hospitalized Joe
I mean it's sort of brilliant in a

267
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.240
satanic sort of way how you conclude
that these women have no right to sue

268
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.840
under the air and water protection act
because the air and water protection act

269
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.240
doesn't protect people but actually only
air and water Joe who had been waffling

270
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.840
on a decision to leave his clearly
mentally ill wife to the Wolves for the

271
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.980
sake of a penis has his mind made up for
him when Lewis dumps him we don't

272
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.880
actually find out what happens to Joe
doesn't matter Harper leaves to travel

273
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.500
the world on Joe's Credit Card prior
blessed by angels has his aides go into

274
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.760
a kind of remission something about AIDS
that happens sometimes in baffles

275
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.780
researchers to this day he forgives
Lewis but refuses to take him back and

276
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.340
then they and Belize become good friends
with Hannah who remains in New York oh

277
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.780
right and Roy Cohn has a gruesome
on-stage death the the more you know

278
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.820
about him the more you get this kind of
schadenfreude about it in addition to

279
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.120
these personal challenges the play
delves into the political and social

280
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.059
issues that were prevalent During the
period and

281
00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:01.919
sadly still to this day the dishonesty
and Corruption that were widespread

282
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:05.760
throughout the Reagan Administration are
exemplified by Roy Cohn the only major

283
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.200
character in the play directly based on
a real person the play is critical of

284
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.740
the lack of sympathy within conservative
administrations for people whose lives

285
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.400
have been touched by AIDS and it
underscores the struggle of the queer

286
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.080
Community for visibility and equality at
the same time it balances the

287
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.559
internalizing factors of living with
AIDS and what that does to someone

288
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:30.539
living in a society whose only discourse
about people living with AIDS is that

289
00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:35.880
they are
the disease deep inside you there's a

290
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.860
part of you the most inner part

291
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.179
entirely free of

292
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.400
the story hurdles toward an apocalyptic
conclusion the paths of the characters

293
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.380
connect and divide bringing them face to
face with their darkest fears their most

294
00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.960
heartfelt desires and the unavoidable
fact that things will always be changing

295
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.880
the play investigates the human capacity
for growth and evolution as well as the

296
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.480
intricate dynamics of relationships in
the search for Connection in a world

297
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.970
that feels more chaotic
with each passing day

298
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:20.640
[Music]
initially a comparison between rent and

299
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.900
angels in America is weird they are at
first comparable because they're

300
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.559
acclaimed theatrical Productions that
are about or feature queer characters

301
00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:32.880
and AIDS in an approximately late 80s
setting however the play's direct

302
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.840
subject matter seems quite different
rent wants to directly discuss

303
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.980
gentrification and the effect that has
on artists and therefore art how the

304
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.360
heartless elements of greed is killing
the concept of Art For Art's Sake it's

305
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.159
about the heart of New York City and who
this Heart Belongs to about Scrappy kids

306
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:56.580
sticking it to the Man by moooing at him
angels in America by contrast is about

307
00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.059
three people's cumulative nervous
breakdown around the question of AIDS

308
00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:04.740
homosexuality and what it means to exist
in this modern world however dig a

309
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.220
Little Deeper still and at the core of
these plays what these plays are

310
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.299
actually meant to say to the audience is
a discussion about change and they're

311
00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:16.980
using AIDS queerness art and the moral
value of America to frame that

312
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.419
discussion where rently away from
actually holding a discourse about AIDS

313
00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:25.620
it focuses on Art and Where Angels in
America laser focuses on the subject of

314
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.340
AIDS in a Darkly comedic way it's
discourse on the condition of art is

315
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:35.520
more
implicit male love isn't ever ambivalent

316
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.440
a comparison drawn between them derives
from their joint central question what

317
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.059
the crap is going on with the USA
famously both of these plays use queer

318
00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:48.179
people to help explore this question and
make use of one of the deadliest

319
00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:51.900
pandemics in human history as part of
the setting however a study of rent

320
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.799
finds that it has shockingly little to
do with AIDS and actively avoids a

321
00:22:55.799 --> 00:23:00.659
discussion about it even when prompted
AZT break and while it contains visible

322
00:23:00.659 --> 00:23:04.380
queer characters there's no real
discussion about queerness itself one

323
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.740
could even argue the queer characters
are inconsequential to the plot with one

324
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.020
exception we'll swing around to later of
the WLW crew Joanne is only really there

325
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.580
as an attache to Marine who again only
seems like she has a lot to do because

326
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.960
she's an interesting character there
will always be women in rubber flirting

327
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.980
with me and it's a shame because Joanne
is one of the few if not only purely

328
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.520
sympathetic characters for whom the
audience is meant to empathize with on

329
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.120
account of her circumstances and actions
Maureen's involvement revolves around

330
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.840
her more or less deliberately starting a
rye yes granted this is a matter of

331
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.080
homeless people resisting their eviction
from a tent city I don't think they

332
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.799
particularly needed the push from a
trust fund baby's bad performance art

333
00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:49.020
who implores them to Moo Moo with me
Collins doesn't really have a whole lot

334
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.320
to do aside from complaining about
having to live in New York City again

335
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.140
it's not really a bad thing to have a
man living with AIDS who is still

336
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.880
dreaming about his future in fact that's
probably a noble and nuanced thing to

337
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.480
depict at the time and yes I realized
that in Productions where Angel a street

338
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.559
performer and Collins's love interest is
depicted as trans that would not

339
00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:11.460
necessarily imply that Collins is gay or
bisexual but it leads to the question

340
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.179
does a queer person in a romance
automatically facilitate queerness it's

341
00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:18.539
also worth noting that angel and Collins
are the only functional couple in the

342
00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:21.900
entire Story Angel is the only one of
the four queer characters who has an

343
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.799
impact on the plot though it's a bit of
a barrier gaze moment Angel's death is

344
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:29.340
one of the final straws for the other
seven friends to largely break ties and

345
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.760
the memory of Angel is the Catalyst for
their lukewarm reconnection in the end

346
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.299
and granted I can see this as being a
nice break from the drag of anti-gay

347
00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:39.780
propaganda and this would be super
fantastic for the time if it wasn't for

348
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.340
the actual plot of rent as per labo M to
be built entirely around a straight

349
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.820
romance really you can cut the gay
characters out of it with the exception

350
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.179
of Angel's death the play's primary
conflict revolves around Benny and Mark

351
00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:55.799
Roger and Mimi angels in America by
contrast features a predominantly queer

352
00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:59.880
cast the only character who isn't queer
or alluded to be queer is Harper who's a

353
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.260
queen in her own right my church we
don't believe in homosexuals in my

354
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.159
church we don't believe in Mormons
what's your Steve

355
00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:10.280
okay

356
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.419
I get it there is however an argument to
be made about angels in America lacking

357
00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:19.679
queer identities outside of five gay men
and a closeted lesbian and I feel like

358
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.679
that's a valid criticism though if
Kushner wanted to stick to writing about

359
00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:26.039
his own lived experiences as a gay man
in the 1980s I can appreciate that

360
00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:31.860
angels in America Dives in to display
the intricate nuances of Gay Culture at

361
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.360
the time and covers a lot of Territory
between four Gay characters Plus

362
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.140
Roy Cohn without an overt discussion
Kushner depicts the ways homophobic

363
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.559
oppression and internalization have
shaped them it's worth noting that none

364
00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:46.679
of these characters ever come out and
tell audiences how homophobia has

365
00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:51.360
affected them but it's apparent that
each of them have some neurotic Behavior

366
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.679
as a result I'm sorry I didn't introduce
you I always get so closety of these

367
00:25:55.679 --> 00:26:01.200
family things but you get Butts hey
cousin Doris uh you don't remember me

368
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.320
I'm Lou a racial's boy Lou not Lewis
because if you say Lewis looking at the

369
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.520
civil and S I don't have a civil let us
blame you hiding this collection of

370
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.720
little things can amount to just as much
of the queer experience as the more

371
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.159
Sinister visible elements of homophobia
and in the case of Roy and Joe we see

372
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:24.059
the destructive side of living a
closeted life Joe seems to be out to

373
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:27.779
destroy Harper and use her to live the
Mormon dream while Roy acts as a grim

374
00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:31.320
prediction of what he will become
however as mentioned the range of queer

375
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.940
experiences seems to be broader in rent
of course depending upon if Angel is a

376
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.620
gay drag queen non-binary or trans but
even with the illusion of lesbian drama

377
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.000
rent is already a wider depiction of the
queer experience it comes down to

378
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.720
whether you would prefer a wider yet
shallow range of topics or a more

379
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.340
isolated topic but with much deeper
exploration I have my preferences

380
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.940
towards angels in America however for
this alone I can't fault anyone for

381
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.440
leaning towards the broader topics
however when it comes to how these queer

382
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.500
characters are depicted in their
struggle with AIDS

383
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.679
rent
comes up short

384
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.980
the grand irony of rent is that its
executive point isn't about AIDS even

385
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.700
though its reference as the AIDS play in
various parodies there is a mention of

386
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.080
AIDS in it but there's very little in
here about the reality of HIV and AIDS

387
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.760
in the musical Rent is a play based on
the signature Opera by Giacomo Puccini

388
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.140
La bohem the major adaptation here aside
from setting and language is

389
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.820
substituting consumption for AIDS
consumption was a catch-all diagnosis

390
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.419
which meant we have no idea what's wrong
with this dying person but they're

391
00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:46.200
losing weight however it was most often
used to describe symptoms of

392
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.020
tuberculosis the problem with swapping
out TB for AIDS is that there was a vast

393
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.340
cultural separation in terms of how the
public observed these conditions largely

394
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.419
arising from how HIV is transmitted and
what that said about the kind of people

395
00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:04.380
such an individual must have associated
with to contract it rent doesn't

396
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.820
particularly handle this like at all
half of the HIV positive cast or

397
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.419
straight and there's additionally very
little depiction of public stigma

398
00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:16.500
against them it's the fact that aids was
a massive cultural shift that quite

399
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.000
frankly our 40 years later culture is
still recovering from while HIV today is

400
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.120
not a death sentence and provided the
use of medication it can be nearly

401
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.720
impossible to transmit this was
something that shifted our entire

402
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.700
culture in a very sudden jarring way
there was a widespread political and

403
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.840
social climate of simply not
acknowledging AIDS at the same time of

404
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.340
it being a kind of Boogeyman AIDS was
this nightmarish real world serial

405
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.480
killing babadook the less it was openly
acknowledged as a problem the worse it

406
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.880
got and it was not discussed and it got
bad it wasn't until 1987 that President

407
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.960
Reagan even openly acknowledged the
existence of AIDS in America AIDS did

408
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.400
not need to be discussed because AIDS
did not exist in the puritanical moral

409
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.779
majority of America AIDS was something
that was contracted by homosexuals as

410
00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:07.260
long as it kept to those people it was
seen as something that properly

411
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.799
monogamous heterosexual people did not
need to worry about and when straight

412
00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:15.779
people did contract it it was was
individuals who were promiscuous or

413
00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:19.799
those who were using intravenous drugs
the Moral Majority had a bible-based

414
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:24.360
case to say that these people had AIDS
as a kind of poetic consequence to their

415
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.720
sinful lives at least that's a moral
argument for those who don't seem to

416
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.440
know anything about Jesus convincing men
to leave their wives for him supporting

417
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.220
sex workers and Healing The Sick without
compensation or Consequences and even

418
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.360
after the straight straight world of
commercial medicine and academic ego

419
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.659
pulled up their big boy pants and
realized that hiv-positive gay guinea

420
00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:48.240
pigs were you know human beings that
were dying horrible deaths

421
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.260
AIDS went largely undiscussed on a
social level we might look back and say

422
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.460
all Madonna did was say that you should
be nice to gay people in the 80s but

423
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.320
this was still a period of time where
there was such a fear around every gay

424
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.059
man carrying AIDs that even at the
height of worldwide Fame just saying

425
00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:10.260
that put her career at risk so if there
is anything about rent's depiction of

426
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.159
AIDS to be credited it is the
willingness to discuss it so openly and

427
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:18.179
feature it as a major component of the
story however this representation is

428
00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:22.440
naturally going to be limited based on
the plot beats of lava m labo m is about

429
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.520
a bunch of Plucky Young Artists living
in paris's low rent artistic District at

430
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.659
a period of time when Bohemian aesthetic
and lifestyle was in Vogue this is the

431
00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:34.500
same setting for instance as Moulin
Rouge the major problem with Faithfully

432
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.640
adapting a story about poverty and
tuberculosis to become a story about

433
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:44.399
poverty and AIDS is that the story is
still about tuberculosis but by the name

434
00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:48.659
of AIDS which means in order to keep the
same pacing of the original story it

435
00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.840
means the reality of AIDS needs to be
secondary to what needs to happen to

436
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.500
keep La bohem's plot beats a large
component of lava m is the Romantic

437
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.520
tension between Rodolfo and Mimi the
characters Roger and Mimi are based on

438
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.440
this is also what makes lavoam a tragedy
because bohemimi dies for realsies

439
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.220
whereas rent Mimi gets resurrected with
the power of the world's most discount

440
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.760
rhyming dictionary however because Roger
and Mimi are both carrying a deadly

441
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.720
infection that's something that can't
really fall to the Wayside but we need

442
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.140
to get this plot moving and that whole
dying horrible death thing could get in

443
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.500
the way so it needs to be addressed in a
way that reminds the audience that aids

444
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.179
is real without interfering with the
actual plot of a drug addict trying to

445
00:31:27.179 --> 00:31:31.020
use AIDS support rhetoric to Badger her
love interest into scoring drugs for her

446
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.520
so how do we address the AIDS elephant
in the room AZT break all right good

447
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.899
enough
I guess there are like seven different

448
00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:44.039
flavors of why this line hasn't aged
well to the point of maybe like maybe it

449
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:47.340
shouldn't have been written in the first
place Roger and Mimi are engaging in a

450
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.580
discussion about their relationship at
which point they are interrupted by a

451
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.659
pager reminding them that it's time to
take their scheduled AZT

452
00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:59.399
the common name used for acetamine AZT
was the first significant AIDS

453
00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:03.360
medication which effectively extended
the lifespan of an AIDS patient by a few

454
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.620
years if not months it was one of those
treatments is almost worse than the

455
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:13.799
disease kind of drugs you have the FDA
giving you a drug so far you've got AZT

456
00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:18.179
why which I can't take because it's too
far too toxic because over half the

457
00:32:18.179 --> 00:32:23.340
people that have HIV okay but the F when
AIDS became every medical researcher's

458
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.220
white whale as in to get the credit for
being the person College a

459
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.559
pharmaceutical company who discovered it
there was a very sudden push to develop

460
00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:35.940
some kind of treatment for it and while
gay men trans people sex workers addicts

461
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.480
and even people who would receive blood
transfusions were dying like gnats in a

462
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.000
cold snap the FDA was dragging the drug
through its regular scientific method of

463
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.279
double-blind Trials it took several
protests a very loud gay man named Larry

464
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:54.720
Kramer and one Doctor Who became famous
again during covid to force the FDA to

465
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.500
push the drug into public availability
and when it did get approved for public

466
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.000
use it cost a small fortune due to
availability was nearly impossible to

467
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.440
get an extended history of AIDS is
fascinating and depressing and I would

468
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.220
implore viewers of this video to dive
into it if you've got the right mindset

469
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.659
because it's very deep and a perfect
example of why we can't trust

470
00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:19.019
corporations maybe I'll make a video
about it but what does all of that mean

471
00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:21.860
when it comes to rent

472
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:29.820
AZT break all right first of all the
degree of flippancy in that line

473
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.200
undermines the impact of a
life-extending treatment for millions of

474
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.799
suffering people the framing of this
delivery is even worse interrupting

475
00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:42.179
their romantic development AZT is meant
as a signifier that aids is keeping them

476
00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:47.039
apart the knowledge of their own looming
mortality is generating a rift however

477
00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:50.760
that's a problem because Mimi wants to
fill that Rift with drugs and Hedonism

478
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.720
and is trying to convince Roger to do
the same thing Mimi hijack's rhetoric

479
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.580
evade support groups like no day but
today and uses it as an excuse to engage

480
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.240
with her addictions whereas the intended
meaning of this is more in line with

481
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.019
Collins's objective if you want to move
to Santa Fe to open a restaurant there's

482
00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:12.000
no point in putting it off so Mimi's
objective is more or less to use AIDS as

483
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.200
a common ground with Roger to bring him
closer to her because misery loves

484
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.179
company so with her intentions of
leveraging AIDS as common ground AZT

485
00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:26.700
time really does function as this
life-saving cure being an obstruction to

486
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.960
what the audience wants
romantic tension deep cut

487
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.679
maybe but for a musical play which won
the Pulitzer Prize for drama I think

488
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.919
it's absolutely within reason to hold it
up to higher standards of consistent

489
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:41.760
literary language however this is a
literary angle that most audiences won't

490
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.540
engage with on a conscious level
especially because AZT has been replaced

491
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.099
with a much more accessible Truvada
which is still expensive but thanks to

492
00:34:50.099 --> 00:34:54.060
government assistance programs within
the price range of understanding how two

493
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.839
jobless squatting drug addicts would be
able to afford it at which point the

494
00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:01.920
question would become how to jobless
squatting drug addicts in the late 80s

495
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.000
could afford pagers which were very
expensive at the time and then also for

496
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.720
Gen Z
what's a pager is Larson presenting a

497
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.079
normative description of the world that
we should make AIDS drugs more

498
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:17.520
accessible so that we can allow these
epic romances to flourish but why

499
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.040
present a fantasy here while errantly
trying to establish a gritty reality in

500
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.160
other places
the language of poverty here isn't

501
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.619
consistent and quite frankly
it's insulting to poor people and this

502
00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:35.460
is what I mean when I say that rent is
limited in its ability to portray AIDS

503
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.420
as per how much it needs to follow the
plot of lava M which is already

504
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.140
problematic because of the four HIV
positive characters in rent only one has

505
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.980
consumption in Lobo M so the closer you
need to follow the plot of La Boheme the

506
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.420
less you can actually present the
reality of AIDS in real life it's also

507
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:56.280
worth noting that in the four act Opera
Mimi only contracts tuberculosis in the

508
00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.060
third act so the plot of labo M being
adapted to replace consumption with AIDS

509
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.320
is not going to be able to properly
frame any discussion about disease or

510
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.280
plague until the halfway point it's also
worth noting that neither Collins nor

511
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.599
angels French Bohemian counterparts have
tuberculosis and that angel survives to

512
00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:16.680
the very end also worth noting that
Collins Angel Maureen Joanne and Benny's

513
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.400
respective characters basically have no
role in the second half of labo M which

514
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.820
explains why rent's second act has no
real structure except for lesbian drama

515
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.500
I see an additional angle of
problematicness here because the second

516
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.520
most significant deviation from The
Source material is to change not only

517
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.500
the ethnicity but the gender and or
sexuality of Angel to give them a highly

518
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.400
stigmatized sexually transmitted
infection and then after sorting them

519
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.020
into multiple vulnerable and
underrepresented identities

520
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.680
to kill them this is second of course to
the most egregious deviation from La

521
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.000
Boheme as mentioned the resurrection of
Mimi which in spite of Angel's death

522
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.720
completely shifts the tone of this
musical from having any kind of

523
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.619
moralizing theme don't worry about poor
people they've got magical Resurrection

524
00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:06.300
music they're fine meanwhile Angel's
over there like where's my song

525
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.619
funny that the straight HIV sufferer
gets the Magical song but the queer one

526
00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:14.339
who didn't even die in La Boheme has to
stay dead even though Angel's romance

527
00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:18.119
with Collins was right there Collins
doesn't get a resurrected love interest

528
00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:22.500
either funny how that works leads me to
feel like the straight versus gay AIDS

529
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.339
politics reads a little bit shallow
Cullen's AIDS more or less has no effect

530
00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:29.700
on the plot until Angel's death and is
brushed over whenever it comes up

531
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.900
meanwhile AIDS swings over Roger and
nimi like an Edgar Allan Poe Horror

532
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.760
Story just always there foreshadowing
tragedy like dramatic irony that being

533
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.579
with the exception of Angel who doesn't
seem to have AIDS until they do

534
00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:45.180
following a very strange musical number
equating the drama of the friend group

535
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.740
to an orgy and Angel emerges saying it's
over and then peacefully wordlessly

536
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:55.140
walks off the stage bathes in Golden
Light adorned in wing-like Linens and on

537
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.160
one hand this is offering visual Justice
to queer victims of AIDS for whom even

538
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.119
left-leaning politicians at the time
decried them as more or less getting

539
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:07.200
what was coming to them again the
framing devices and the larger contexts

540
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.859
are not flattering especially for a
Pulitzer prize-winning play Angel was a

541
00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:14.040
spry and Lively character for whom
sympathy wasn't really something

542
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.020
projected to the audience where we see
silently Angel's time in an AIDS hospice

543
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.280
during a musical number that they're not
even involved in this is our only window

544
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.660
in the entire production that depicts
the reality of AIDS for many people

545
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.060
especially because Angel goes from this
to having an orgy that's likely meant to

546
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.200
be both allegorical and literal knowing
that they have late stage AIDS it's not

547
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.040
framing Angel as a sympathetic character
an honorable depiction would be clearly

548
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.480
displaying Angel as not being in a
situation where they may spread a deadly

549
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.560
infection especially because many in
America specifically use the language of

550
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.740
lechery and perversion to describe a
group of people they felt knowingly or

551
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.940
maliciously spread the disease putting
angel in that category is not something

552
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.020
I think is a flattering use of a queer
character and if you want to go deep and

553
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.200
literary and I think this says more
about the kind of people who were voting

554
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.640
for The pulitzers at the time Angel's
death can even be read as Poetic Justice

555
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.420
where Mimi's death is met with an
onstage Bluster of concern and grief

556
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.200
Angel goes straight from an orgy to
their funeral at peace for the first

557
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.160
time in the play their friends remark
about their joy-filled memories of Angel

558
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.079
we don't see Angel's death nor do we see
how anyone but Collins was trying to do

559
00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:29.520
anything to help Mimi the straight one
was framed as a tragedy because that's

560
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.660
how it was framed in Lobo M this is a
young girl with a loving mother who will

561
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.320
break the hearts of everyone who she
knows and she has the rest of her life

562
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.579
to live Angel's death contrarily was
framed tragically yes but as an

563
00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.300
inevitability
as a natural consequence keeping in mind

564
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.619
that Angel's love om counterpart did not
die there's a significant case to say

565
00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:53.220
that the plot could have progressed as
it did regardless if Angel died or not

566
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.180
depending on the direction there is even
language here to suggest that angel is

567
00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.680
better off dead that they're more at
peace dead than they were alive death is

568
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.880
a mercy for what they were experiencing
not two scenes earlier especially sour

569
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.140
is that angel in earlier Productions is
depicted exclusively in drag while

570
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.520
they're alive and then when they are
dead we see them out of drag for the

571
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.440
first time
and this is how we are left to believe

572
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.359
they are most at peace with their
queerness removed I would never say

573
00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:28.260
Larson was communicating this on purpose
however it's certainly a possible

574
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.920
reading and when you don't have to dig
very deep to read into gonna bring up

575
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.220
the fact again that this one the
Pulitzer Prize for drama which means

576
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.660
that I feel we have the literary license
to be able to extrapolate such readings

577
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.740
like this the award is held in high
esteem and indicates that the author was

578
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.880
thinking deeply about all the signifiers
and symbols of what they were writing

579
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.740
but then again most of the audience for
rent and likely most of the Pulitzer

580
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.500
voters were straight people they cheered
at the resurrection of the straight

581
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.440
character and the death of the queer
character was depicted to make them feel

582
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.579
sad it's not a good feeling to think of
myself as being here to elicit sympathy

583
00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:06.839
out of an audience that's my role in
media it's just to live tragically rent

584
00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:11.339
has this very dark likely unintended
Shadow looming over it where it reflects

585
00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:16.020
the real world but in this cynical meta
textual way AIDS research did not really

586
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.400
exist until straight people began dying
from it the audience does not need a

587
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.880
resurrection for Angel because their
role not only as a character but as a

588
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.260
human being is Expendable alive or dead
is just as good

589
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.579
but for Mimi there is a want to see her
alive why should Mimi survive without

590
00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:37.980
angel because the reality was that a
titanically larger number of queer

591
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.520
people died compared to straight people
because whenever queer people were in

592
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.960
the news it was as an AIDS victim or a
murder victim

593
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.460
the audience had been desensitized to
queer suffering for Generations even if

594
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.220
you didn't feel that queer people
deserved to die it was certainly

595
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:58.260
expected when we did but it was Mimi For
Whom the laws of nature were bent and

596
00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:02.880
was brought back to life in a stark
standout moment of magic realism for

597
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.020
which the enduring two hours of
production sought to present a grim

598
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.820
gritty and sorrowful reality of American
destitution it was the pretty young CIS

599
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.839
Girl Who Loved a pretty young straight
boy who deserved Magic

600
00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:21.420
because in a cynical way it is framed
that a normal girl did not deserve to

601
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.020
die of AIDS
in a way that was foreseeable for Angel

602
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.160
however
when a queer Creator makes media about

603
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.200
the queer experience
it seems we're the ones who get the

604
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:40.260
magic instead
[Music]

605
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.520
in angels in America
there are no punches pulled when it

606
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.880
comes to AIDS multiple characters have
close friends who have died of the

607
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.780
disease and two characters the
protagonist prior and the antagonist Roy

608
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.280
Cohn are currently living with it one of
the most striking aspects of prior's

609
00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.680
portrayal is his physical deterioration
which serves as a brutal manifestation

610
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.119
of the effects of AIDS The Story begins
with Pryor at a funeral forcing him to

611
00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:10.920
face the Specter of death from the very
first scene and Kushner uses vivid

612
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.760
descriptions of Pryor's declining Health
to highlight the brutal toll the disease

613
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.260
takes on the body well it's not going
well really

614
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.780
two new lesions
my leg hurts

615
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.740
there's protein in my urine the doctor
says but

616
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:35.220
who knows what the that portends
anyway it shouldn't be there the protein

617
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.980
my butt is chapped from diarrhea and
yesterday I shot blood prior's weakened

618
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.880
immune system leaves him susceptible to
opportunistic infections causing weight

619
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.720
loss capacity sarcoma lesions and a
great deterioration of his physical

620
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.500
appearance he's in and out of the
hospital each time more convinced that

621
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.660
he'll never get to leave and he hates
hospitals the first visit is preceded by

622
00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.119
a harrowing scene in which his whole
body is in pain due to a mounting fever

623
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:07.859
he cries out for Lewis who finds him
just moments before Pryor has an

624
00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:11.160
accident that covers him in feces and
blood

625
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.359
and then the fever mounts and he faints
his transformation from a vibrant young

626
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:20.160
man to a skeletal figure serves as a
potent visual representation of the

627
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.460
brutality of AIDS however Pryor's
experiences with illness are often

628
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.300
depicted through Vivid and painful
metaphors his description of the lesions

629
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.220
as Angels touch is particularly poignant
as it reveals the paradoxical nature of

630
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.900
suffering the Divine and destructive
intertwined and then the arrival of an

631
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.740
Angel representing the collective fears
and anxieties surrounding the disease

632
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.880
exasperates prior psychological mess his
battle with depression and fear of

633
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.079
Abandonment highlight the immense
psychological burden imposed by AIDS its

634
00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:52.859
prior's fear of Abandonment that forms
the Crux of the Supernatural story

635
00:44:52.859 --> 00:44:56.579
within angels in America when he's
abandoned by his lover Lewis after the

636
00:44:56.579 --> 00:45:01.260
diagnosis is when the visitations from
the angel begins declaring prior a

637
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.300
prophet in the end we discover that Not
only was Prior abandoned but all of

638
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.140
humanity was abandoned when God left
heaven in the early days of the 20th

639
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:15.300
century leading to the biggest Wars in
human history and now to AIDS but

640
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.839
despite the brutal portrayal of AIDS
Kushner offers glimmers of Triumph and

641
00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:22.200
resilience through Pryor's character
Pryor's refusal to be silenced or

642
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.460
diminished by the disease embodies a
spirit of resilience and Defiance his

643
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.599
determination to fight for his voice
agency and love despite overwhelming

644
00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:35.640
odds serves as a testament to the human
spirit and acts as a stand-in for the

645
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.240
countless people at the time fighting
tooth and nail to be taken seriously by

646
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.619
the government and doctors of the world
through prior Kushner presents a vision

647
00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:47.579
of Hope in the face of adversity but not
all characters have such a sunny ending

648
00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:50.819
Roy Cohn a prominent lawyer and
political figure and Donald Trump's

649
00:45:50.819 --> 00:45:56.520
Mentor FYI acts as a cautionary symbol
of opting for power in lieu of

650
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.260
internalized homophobia and embodies a
larger societal denial of the epidemic

651
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.040
despite being diagnosed with AIDS Roy
adamantly refuses to accept his

652
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.540
condition instead forcing his doctor to
treat him for liver cancer

653
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.160
because regardless if he has AIDS or not
if the public learns that he has AIDS

654
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:19.800
only then will he become a homosexual
and Roy Cohn in spite of having a

655
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.220
pension for pretty blonde boys has
nothing but contempt for homosexuals and

656
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.140
makes it abundantly clear why he does
not want people to think of him as one

657
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:32.819
yay lesbian you think these are names
that tell you who someone sleeps with

658
00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:39.119
but they don't tell you that like all
labels they tell you one thing and one

659
00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:43.619
thing only
when is an individual so identified fit

660
00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:49.680
in the food chain in the pecking order
not ideology of sexual taste but

661
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.680
something much simpler clout not Hawaii
so who's me but who will pick up the

662
00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:03.720
phone when I call who owes me favors
this is what a label refers to

663
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:09.599
now to someone who does not understand
this homosexual is what I am because I

664
00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:15.619
have sex with men but really
this is wrong

665
00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:20.300
homosexuals are not men who sleep with
other men

666
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.480
homosexual is a man who in 15 years of
trying

667
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.819
cannot pass a piss hands
anti-discrimination Bill through city

668
00:47:29.819 --> 00:47:36.660
council homosexuals are men who know
nobody and who nobody knows who have

669
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.220
zero club Roy's denial reflects the
stigma associated with AIDS at the time

670
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:45.060
as he fears the impact of the disease
will have on his career and Public Image

671
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.260
his desire to maintain power and control
blinds him to the reality of his own

672
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.920
mortality and the pain endured by others
suffering from the disease Kushner

673
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.700
portrays the physical and emotional
struggles endured by Roy as the disease

674
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.300
progresses most prominently in the
body-wide cramps that overtake him later

675
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.780
on in the play the feverish
hallucinations of Ethel Rosenberg that

676
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.099
haunt him and the fast physical
deterioration from an aggressive lawyer

677
00:48:08.099 --> 00:48:12.060
Manning his multi-line phone to the
barely conscious wraith wandering the

678
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:16.500
halls of the AIDS Wing where he'll die
and as his health declines Roy is

679
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.760
confronted with his own real mortality
when the New York Bar Association votes

680
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.260
to dispar him Roy didn't fear death
until his legacy was taken from him he's

681
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.380
even faced with the fact that treatment
for this disease is more wrapped up in

682
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.579
politics and doctoral showboating than
actually helping people watch out for

683
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:35.520
the double blind
they don't want you to sign something

684
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.420
that says they didn't give you m M's
instead of the real drug you'll die but

685
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.180
they'll get the kind of Statistics they
can publish in the New England Journal

686
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.480
of Medicine and you can't sue them
because you signed and if you don't sign

687
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.099
no pills so if you have any strings left
pull them because everyone is put

688
00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:53.760
through the double blind but this times
against you you can't around with

689
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.420
placebos but his Connections in
Washington and New York who help him

690
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.980
skip the line and get a fridge full of
AZT all to himself when maybe 30 people

691
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.000
in the whole country had access to the
drug means nothing his big house in

692
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.119
Manhattan his deal making and power
brokering even his connections with

693
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:12.660
Reagan himself
couldn't save him from the same disease

694
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.400
that was killing people he described as
nobodies there is no romance in the

695
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.839
portrayal of AIDS in angels in America
it's pain it's blood its fevers

696
00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:27.000
hallucinations diarrhea spasms swollen
glands opportunistic skin cancers not

697
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.500
only did it kill people in droves but
these were horrific deaths mortifying

698
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.579
nurses and the loved ones of victims and
Through The Gallows and hellish

699
00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:39.780
conditions of a body destroying itself
we looked for some kind of meaning to it

700
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.839
all
why is it all happening we were

701
00:49:42.839 --> 00:49:47.819
searching for purpose and a reason to go
on staring down a microscopic sadist

702
00:49:47.819 --> 00:49:51.780
which knew no borders boundaries nor
Justice it targeted evil men like Roy

703
00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.619
Cohn and good men like prior Walter
without discrimination

704
00:49:55.619 --> 00:50:00.359
in the end Roy is dead and his dragon's
horde of AZT is swipe to be given to

705
00:50:00.359 --> 00:50:04.020
people who need it
no miracle drug to be sure but something

706
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.040
akin to a reason to Hope
and because this is fiction where we can

707
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:12.780
create a world where Poetic Justice
exists prior finds reprieve whether from

708
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.500
the blessings of an actual angel or the
simple remission of a virus that still

709
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.619
baffles researchers to this day
fighting AIDS is about choosing life so

710
00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:27.800
if this is angels in America
why is rent

711
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.599
so much more well known and loved

712
00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:39.900
not only is rent
more well known than angels in America

713
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.560
but more well known than almost any
queer inclusive production it's

714
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.579
remembered as a groundbreaker for
queerness depicted on stage even though

715
00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:51.180
Millennium approaches was hailed as a
masterpiece years before rent appeared

716
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:55.020
and La Casa fall and torsong Trilogy
were on Broadway even earlier than that

717
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.160
I mentioned earlier but rent has
something that neither angels in America

718
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.660
had big in the ingredients torch song
Trilogy La Casa fall nor even Avenue Q

719
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.760
have rent
is palatable to the exact kind of people

720
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.740
it needs to be Where Angels in America
will go as far to outline that Lewis is

721
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:19.200
a bit of a smell Queen the queer
components about rent seem edgeless even

722
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.260
though we're dealing with two explicitly
promiscuous characters they seem

723
00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.819
particularly inoffensive now perhaps
this is to Larson's credit normalizing

724
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:31.380
promiscuity however Maureen is more or
less a farcical character she's like

725
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.460
this obliviously unbothered manic pixie
dream girl for whom neither consequences

726
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:40.200
nor sociological realities apply however
in the case of Mimi and implicitly Angel

727
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.500
at least before their romance with
Collins there's this kind of poetic

728
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.940
justice about it that their lecherous
lifestyle is being cosmically punished

729
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.319
with poverty and poor health meanwhile
Lewis and angels in America remarks his

730
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:56.280
regretful disbelief in Pryor's AIDS
diagnosis confessing that he screwed

731
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.000
around a lot more than prior did this
was a reality of AIDS somehow people

732
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.960
could screw their way from one orgy to
the next all through the 70s and 80s and

733
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.700
somehow never contract it Elton John
being one case example who has openly

734
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.440
expressed shock that somehow he dodged
that bullet rent doesn't try and build a

735
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.940
fantasy about this but it also doesn't
dive into the reality of it either which

736
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.680
is a statement that could describe why
the play was and is so popular this is

737
00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.940
roughly what I mean when I describe it
as palatable reality is difficult to

738
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.839
portray in media and given the
philosophical parameters a fiction may

739
00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:35.040
be impossible to depict however it seems
to be the case and this is mostly

740
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.040
observational backed up by some
scattered tidbits of critical analysis

741
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.480
I've picked up a knob of the years that
people disseminate fiction as if it were

742
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.980
a reality this is why people can be such
sticklers about representation bad

743
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:51.000
representation sets a precedent for how
certain people are expected to act in

744
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.680
real life and this works both ways too
much positive depiction can set a bar

745
00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.180
for Behavior too high for people to
realistically meet leading to unmet

746
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:04.079
expectations of good behavior the
reality of a given identity usually

747
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:08.520
contains a narrative history of a press
and while a given identity is not

748
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.140
defined by that oppression their
interactions with the outside world is

749
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.760
going to be colored by this history two
gay people holding hands in a small town

750
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.380
in the evening will passively let go of
each other and put distance between each

751
00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.680
other when they hear a camera coming
around the corner

752
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.480
this reaction is unspoken and reflexive
neither individual will hold it against

753
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.700
the other and it's just accepted
hand-holding passively resumes when the

754
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.780
car is gone
this also varies depending upon region

755
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.140
there are nuances depicting these
identities in a way which calls to

756
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:48.359
attention this narrative history it's
automatically going to

757
00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:52.440
you know challenge the existing
structures of privilege in society and

758
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.559
as we know from experience certain
people are privileged do not like to be

759
00:53:55.559 --> 00:53:58.859
challenged people don't want to feel
like they and their attitudes are

760
00:53:58.859 --> 00:54:02.520
responsible for a condition of suffering
and they certainly don't want to feel

761
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.119
like in order to change the
circumstances of suffering that they

762
00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:09.599
ought to change their own attitudes
people like to feel like they're doing

763
00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:13.500
enough and there's a certain kind of
Shame associated with feeling like

764
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.819
they're part of the problem which for
those of us who have spent

765
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:24.480
some time on www.twitter.com an all too
common reaction to that shame is denial

766
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.460
and deflection so if a play confronts
the audience with a coded message about

767
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:33.300
shifting moral values and sentiments
that comes on too strongly General

768
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:37.440
audiences are less likely to recommend
that play to their friends even if said

769
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.900
play is lauded by theater nerds to be
palatable is to portray these identities

770
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.920
without confronting the elements of
privilege derived from oppression and

771
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.760
this isn't always a bad thing six and
Hamilton both contain an incredibly

772
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.000
diverse cast through the audience being
implored to empathize with these

773
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.540
characters there's an implicit call to
action for the audience to address these

774
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.640
identities in real life as social equals
rather than someone getting up on a

775
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.660
soapbox to talk about oppression at the
audience and in the case of Collins as

776
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.319
an HIV positive man who is still
thinking about manifesting his best life

777
00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:15.000
in the future this is very much the case
in rent Collins also has AIDS while

778
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.900
escaping the aforementioned trap of
poetic justice where there are

779
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.980
consequences to his condition in fact I
can see Collins as a character fitting

780
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:27.780
into the cast of Angels in America but
rent's palatableness isn't exclusively

781
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.160
linked to gender and sexuality which
even considering my musings about angel

782
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.420
I don't have too much of a problem with
in a practical sense of observing media

783
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:40.800
I also feel that Mimi's character was
well handled her Arc focused upon her

784
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.180
understanding of no day but today that
coincides with her learning to Value her

785
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.800
own life rather than throwing it away
similar to Prior I can see her learning

786
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.119
to strive for her own life rather than
just giving in to pessimism are the

787
00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:59.400
diverse identities in rent palatable
well yes the play itself doesn't really

788
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.119
explore how the cultural norm inherently
pushes these identities to the fringes

789
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:07.200
of society where isolated from social
supports they are more vulnerable to

790
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.579
high-risk activities where one is more
likely to be exposed to HIV the script

791
00:56:11.579 --> 00:56:17.420
takes these elements for granted was it
obliged to explore that

792
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:22.619
would have been nice if it did because
in rent which deals with social themes

793
00:56:22.619 --> 00:56:27.000
there really isn't any call to action
whatsoever okay it sucks to be poor it

794
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.839
sucks to have AIDS
what do we do about it Pryor Belize

795
00:56:30.839 --> 00:56:36.000
Hannah Lewis and Harper have this very
philosophical esoteric call to action

796
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.220
which more or less implores the audience
to accept that change is inevitable you

797
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.180
can die mad about it or accept it and to
be fair Lobo M doesn't really have much

798
00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.740
of an answer about it either however as
a tragedy it can more freely moralize

799
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.859
the actions of the characters as a
cautionary tale look at these characters

800
00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:57.480
if you want to avoid tragedy then don't
do what they did changing that ending

801
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.800
for rent there's no real push everything
works out kind of and things are fine

802
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:07.020
the public is presented with no reality
about what they can do or even what they

803
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.920
need to do
things are fine

804
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.980
it also doesn't help that rents
depiction of poverty and art in general

805
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.400
also follow this pattern art is being
commercialized

806
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:22.319
okay
what do we do about it rent solution is

807
00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:26.760
let artists make their art but what if
like Maureen's performance art it just

808
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:31.619
sucks what if like Mark's documentary it
offers nothing to society even Marine

809
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:36.839
Benny is the only one who calls her out
for only making her performance to boost

810
00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:40.319
her own ego and quite frankly there
isn't a whole lot of textual evidence to

811
00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:43.619
refute that in fact the only character
who expresses any desire to build

812
00:57:43.619 --> 00:57:47.520
community is Benny who is demonized by
the entire cast because he wants his

813
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.760
tenants to pay a reasonable amount of
rent none of the other characters have

814
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:56.040
any objectives to make art for any other
reason than an intrinsic need to make

815
00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.599
something to benefit the self but then
again Benny is an entirely benign

816
00:58:00.599 --> 00:58:06.420
villain which quite frankly is insulting
that the play depicts him as a

817
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:11.700
tyrannical landlord next to what a lot
of us have had to endure as tenants but

818
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.300
then again a massive portion of the
audience for rent are either homeowners

819
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.960
or the children of homeowners who are
the primary audience of modern Broadway

820
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.520
itself those tickets are expensive to
them shutting off the power is the Apex

821
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:28.140
of tyranny and rent casually ignores the
fact that legally Benny could have done

822
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:35.099
a lot worse poverty itself is palatable
it's an inconvenience but it's not the

823
00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:39.540
worst thing in the world these Scrappy
kids are sticking it out aren't they the

824
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:43.319
reality of poverty and the situation of
living in New York's East Village you

825
00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:48.960
know is Alphabet City is also casually
ignored it was in the early 90s Islam

826
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.760
you shouldn't want to live there it was
an urban center for which survival was

827
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.420
an accomplishment the actual reality of
confronting homelessness in New York

828
00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.839
City is more accurately expressed in
angels in America

829
00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:09.900
when you stop that disgusting slurping
he's disgusting slurping feeding animal

830
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:14.160
feeding yourself what would it matter to
you or to anyone if you just stopped

831
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.839
feeding
and died it is uncomfortable it is

832
00:59:18.839 --> 00:59:24.540
mental illness it is desperation it is
half cohesive confrontation it's the

833
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:30.240
inability to watch but the impossibility
to look away it is an impossible Welling

834
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.079
of empathy that can only be reconciled
by completely disconnecting emotional

835
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:38.099
impulse because the force of social
change needed to fix that at an

836
00:59:38.099 --> 00:59:43.920
Institutional level is astronomical it's
not mooing at cops until they go away

837
00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.299
we have seen what the police are capable
of to think that mooing at them is going

838
00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:51.900
to fix the problem never mind that the
framing device of rent narrated by Mark

839
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.440
the most privileged of the characters
focuses the story on Roger and Mimi's

840
00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.559
relationship and not the cluster of
homeless people fighting for their

841
00:59:58.559 --> 01:00:03.720
ability to exist in a place homeless
confrontation is much more sanitized in

842
01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.400
rent reaching a climactic Zenith when
Mark records a homeless woman being

843
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.140
accosted by the police
she accuses Mark of inaction of using

844
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:18.660
her suffering to benefit him and his
craft which is abundantly true and a

845
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.960
debate that is at the heart of
documentary and ethics and while Mark

846
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.520
feels sad about this at first his queer
friends of color swoop in to more or

847
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.020
less absolve him of all wrongdoing
because hey she just doesn't get your

848
01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.760
art the world is going to benefit from
it you got this bro only it won't

849
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.359
because he doesn't seem to have any
Ambitions of showing his art to anybody

850
01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:42.960
else but his group of friends and still
expects to be financially supported for

851
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.760
it however Mark seems to be married to
Pariah Hood cotton this double speak of

852
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.660
wanting to have certain privileges
audiences and beliefs while at the same

853
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.200
time rejecting financial support from
his parents and refusing to do anything

854
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.640
to support the Bohemian Community he is
so attached to it's made clear that he

855
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.900
has a very caring mother who routinely
calls him it's suggested that she is

856
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.940
also willing to help financially support
him however not only does he ignore her

857
01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.420
calls he seems to treat her with a
degree of annoyance in fact it's

858
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.500
indicated that many of the cast come
from loving families who seem willing to

859
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.099
take them off the streets and give them
good homes except for Angel and Collins

860
01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:24.420
because queer however that would come at
the cost of their entire artistic

861
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:27.839
identity being built around roughing it
out in the slums and that's a bridge too

862
01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:32.280
far can't make good art and good homes
at which point rent establishes a very

863
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.420
toxic depiction of poverty itself which
against the textual Mandate of this play

864
01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.859
portrays poor people as a people who
refuse jobs and turn down work and B

865
01:01:40.859 --> 01:01:45.420
people who ultimately choose to be poor
meanwhile Mark particularly admittedly

866
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.559
complains about the death of bohemia
because for all Mark likes taking the

867
01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:52.680
center stage and getting all the
attention as a social advocate he

868
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.040
refuses to pay his tab at a local
restaurant you know if you want to keep

869
01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.420
Bohemia alive you got to support these
local businesses because they actually

870
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.260
do pay rent
and if they can't pay rent they have to

871
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.160
sell their business which leads to
gentrification but again

872
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.020
as per the palatability of poverty this
is never really discussed question or

873
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.099
mentioned because they're far too
invested in being Pariah as to actually

874
01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:21.420
change anything about their actions it's
okay Mark you don't have to change just

875
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.140
keep doing what you're doing keep
complaining about the right things but

876
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.619
you're under no obligation to do or
change anything

877
01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:32.040
don't worry
you're one of the good ones you're a

878
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.640
straight white man and this is the key
component of moralizing the quality of

879
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.280
palatability in media if this media is
presenting a problem upon whom is the

880
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.059
onus to change
the overarching institutions the public

881
01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:48.420
at Large
in rent like Angel and Collins

882
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.559
absolvement of marks in action against
police brutality there is no suggestion

883
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:57.059
for those a privileged to change no
lesson there's no indication of how to

884
01:02:57.059 --> 01:03:01.500
change or even to change at all just sit
watch these poor people cry when

885
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.740
something sad happens but ultimately
don't worry they've got magical

886
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.359
Resurrection music they're fine the onus
is on the underclasses to sort out their

887
01:03:09.359 --> 01:03:15.059
business and get it together no change
is required of the wealthy

888
01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:19.040
except maybe to stop wearing Oakleys

889
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.640
put aside artistic intent Integrity
quality of representation scope of

890
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.540
representation politics or our own
conceptions of the literary conventions

891
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:35.520
at play there is a simple unifying
factor between angels in America and

892
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.200
rent they stand as Symphonies of Hope
amidst the trials and tribulations faced

893
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.160
by people held down by disease addiction
and poverty

894
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.119
in both plays we witnessed the
Relentless pursuit of human Connections

895
01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:52.020
in the face of overwhelming odds the
characters battle societal constraints

896
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.460
discrimination illness and personal
demons yet they refuse to be silenced or

897
01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.359
broken in angels in America the AIDS
epidemic looms large threatening the

898
01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:04.740
lives of its characters and casting a
shadow of Despair however it is through

899
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.980
the unlikely bonds between prior and
Hannah that we witness the

900
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.839
transformative Power of Love
and acceptance prior's resilience and

901
01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:16.980
determination to live despite his
illness become a rallying Cry For Hope

902
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:21.180
conversely rent highlights the
intersection of Art and activism as a

903
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.500
means to confront societal injustices
and Inspire change the characters in

904
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.579
both plays become catalysts symbols
signifiers and advocates for social

905
01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:33.660
progress challenging prevailing norms
and fighting against the forces of

906
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:38.819
Oppression whether that oppression comes
from capitalistic greed or from the very

907
01:04:38.819 --> 01:04:42.960
Heavenly forces that facilitate our
existence and angels in America the

908
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.099
Angelic presence represents a Divine
call to action

909
01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:53.099
the world only spins forward
there is no going back there is no again

910
01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:57.900
there's only next time we cannot go back
to the days of the past when God sat in

911
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.040
heaven and queer people hidden closets
that's not how the Divine physics of the

912
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.000
world works
a gloomy and painful mood is set upon

913
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.660
the stage in the first section of Angels
in America by kushner's attention to the

914
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.740
political and historical breakdown of
the planet due to reactionary policies

915
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.000
and invocations of environmental and
nuclear calamities the characters

916
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.720
experience a similar predicament as the
story reaches its Midway conclusion

917
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.460
things between Lewis and prior start to
deteriorate Joe's persistent denial of

918
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:30.359
his homosexuality nearly destroys
Harper's mind and causes the ultimate

919
01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:35.700
crack in their marriage locked in their
isolation their false Notions that it is

920
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.359
necessary or even possible to continue
as they have been

921
01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:43.680
they are at a standstill unable to go
forward with their lives

922
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.359
Harper says I can't move my emotions
serve as a rudder

923
01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:52.200
Pryor and Roy's aids diagnoses mean that
they must like Jacob and the angel

924
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.480
wrestle an impossible and unfair fight
but this is a battle where faith in a

925
01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.819
better world is power and Roy is found
wanting alternatively perestroika the

926
01:06:02.819 --> 01:06:05.400
second part of the play which is named
for the Russian word meaning

927
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:10.500
restructuring is about a glimmer of
optimism and a challenging path out of

928
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.599
the crisis once again politics and
historical ideas shape the protagonists

929
01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:19.440
and antagonists they are gradually
figuring out how to rearrange their

930
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.280
lives this depiction of transformation
which is portrayed as profoundly

931
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.079
unsettling is not a pretty one although
development is portrayed negatively it

932
01:06:28.079 --> 01:06:32.819
is unavoidable Pryor who was picked by
the Heavens to spread calm conservatism

933
01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:38.280
comes to the realization of unavoidable
progress as he resolves to resist giving

934
01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:44.700
in to hopelessness we can't just stop
we're not rocks

935
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:52.099
progress migration motion is modernity
it's animate it's what living things do

936
01:06:52.099 --> 01:06:59.819
we desire even if all we desire is
stillness it's still desire for

937
01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:05.220
even if we go faster than we should
we can't wait even he knows that change

938
01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.900
is inevitable in order to keep up with
the times he contrasts his stance with

939
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.319
that of the Angels who are passively
waiting for God's return and the

940
01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:17.400
restoration of their Realm
instead he rejects the message of a

941
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.700
superior being and places emphasis on
the need for transformation and

942
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:26.339
development at the individual level
in the epilogue of the play he says this

943
01:07:26.339 --> 01:07:30.359
disease will be the end of many of us
but not nearly all

944
01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:35.099
and the dead will be commemorated
and will struggle on with the living

945
01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:40.799
and we are not going away we won't die
secret deaths anymore

946
01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:45.480
the world only spins forward
so when you see the people demanding we

947
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.039
go back that we regress
who want to spin the world back to a

948
01:07:50.039 --> 01:07:54.240
time when they were comfortable
know that they will simply be left

949
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.440
behind
progress is inevitable sometimes it's

950
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.880
messy and painful
but it will come

951
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.280
because the world only spins forward and
you will be here to see it

952
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.660
promise yourself
that you will be here to see it

953
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.160
you are amazing people each and every
one of you and every day you are blessed

954
01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.699
with more life

955
01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:23.239
the time has come

956
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:28.040
