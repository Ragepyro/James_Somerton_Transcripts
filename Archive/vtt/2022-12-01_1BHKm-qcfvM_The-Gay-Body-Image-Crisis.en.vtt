00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.820
why are queer men hyper focused on body
image it may involve a social philosophy

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.480
called objectification which is the act
of treating persons as objects or things

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.440
dehumanizing them and making them sexual
objects instead of real people gay men

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.779
more so than heterosexual men tend to
self-objectify and place higher

5
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.640
importance on physical attractiveness
body image issues aren't unique to queer

6
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
men but toxic thoughts pertaining to
self-worth and physical care are

7
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.239
dangerously prevalent within the
community

8
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.500
open an app like grinder and you'll be
greeted with body shaming phrases so

9
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
familiar and cliche that straight people
even know about them too no fats no

10
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.980
Femmes Gym Fit only I work out so should
you

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.559
this incessant need to achieve a hot
body has become incredibly prevalent

12
00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.399
with even men with literal Superhero
level bodies complaining about feeling

13
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
fat on Instagram the pressure can
trigger more than just social media

14
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
jealousy though research published in
2019 by Dalhousie University found that

15
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
social demands placed upon gay men to
eat healthily and achieve a perfect body

16
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.220
are linked to anxiety and depression and
have serious mental health consequences

17
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
the national eating disorder Association
also says that lgbtq plus identified

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.299
folks experience unique stressors that
may contribute to the development of an

19
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.840
eating disorder one such stressor
the inability to meet body ideals within

20
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.299
some lgbtq plus cultural contexts
approximately 84 percent of gay men say

21
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.520
they feel under intense pressure to have
a body culturally defined as hot not

22
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
healthy or even fit
hot they are three times more likely

23
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.159
than straight men to have body image
issues only one percent stated that they

24
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.180
were very happy with their appearance
and those unhappy with their appearance

25
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.759
continue to struggle with it well into
middle age and Beyond of course in the

26
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.140
social media era our phones make it
easier than ever to fall into the toxic

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.819
trap of comparing ourselves to others in
every way this person has a nicer home

28
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.739
this person has a nicer car that person
has more followers this person seems to

29
00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.520
look like Chris Evans in full Captain
America mode every moment of every day

30
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.360
when the fact of the matter is that
Chris Evans doesn't even like looking

31
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.379
like Captain America part of the reason
he was so vehement about his decision to

32
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.000
not continue portraying the character
was because of the intense demands on

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.959
his body it's also part of the reason
he'd request shirtless scenes in his

34
00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.800
movies if he was going to suffer to look
like that he was going to make sure that

35
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.340
everyone could see it famously during
the filming of Captain America's Civil

36
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
War he asked the directors if his shirt
could rip off while he was holding a

37
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.220
helicopter to a landing pad
they figured it would have been a bit

38
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.720
much in order to get his body in the
kind of Tip-Top condition that made

39
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.519
Hayley Atwell slip out of character for
a minute his daily routine was grueling

40
00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.680
and his meal plan was bleak
low carb heavy green vegetables and meal

41
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.959
supplements and to boot anytime you see
his body he dehydrated himself for at

42
00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.659
least 48 Hours leading up to the Chute
people don't just look like that it is a

43
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.280
full-time job not only to get into shape
like that but to keep yourself in shape

44
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
like that and given how imbalanced your
nutritional intake needs to be on top of

45
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.379
intermittent dehydration it's not
healthy to sustain that kind of body

46
00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.080
type for very long it's not possible to
look like that all the time

47
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.580
and expecting someone to look like that
at all is a little absurd how much life

48
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.080
do you miss out on by living at the gym
that much the pressure to conform to a

49
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.980
certain body type is even harder to get
a grip on when the Finish Line keeps

50
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.019
getting pushed back over time
as a younger gay man I was told that I

51
00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.760
was too fat and would never be accepted
in this world skinny was the only way

52
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.760
forward
and I was told that was easy to achieve

53
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.780
I could just eat less and be more active
and lose weight if only it were that

54
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.659
simple
as I've mentioned in previous videos I

55
00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.620
came out pretty young I was 12 when I
first started telling people that I was

56
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.220
gay because I was just too damn
impatient to wait any longer I wanted a

57
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.180
boyfriend and I wanted one ASAP through
my teen years finding other gay people

58
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.139
was near impossible but when I did
manage to find one

59
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.360
I always got the same response ew you're
fat go away it was basically those words

60
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.620
every time without variation sometimes
it felt like they'd all gotten together

61
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.520
and written a script
which didn't help my body issues at all

62
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.500
you see I was sent to a dietitian when I
was seven years old my doctors didn't

63
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.419
think that my baby fat was coming off
fast enough and wanted it under control

64
00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.740
so I was put on a strict calorie
controlled diet that my parents my

65
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.720
friends parents and my extended family
made sure I followed to a T

66
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.259
later on I was told that this kind of
dieting at such a young age may have

67
00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.820
actually stunted my growth since most of
my male cousins are well over six feet

68
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.960
tall but despite the diet I continued to
gain weight

69
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.280
the only explanation from The dietitian
was that I must be cheating or that my

70
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.199
parents must be slipping me snacks
the blame was placed squarely on actions

71
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.699
not body chemistry
no tests were run to see if maybe I had

72
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.740
a malfunctioning thyroid or anything
like that I was just eating too much

73
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.220
plain and simple eventually my mother
stopped taking me to see The dietitian

74
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.460
because I only left there feeling worse
about myself every time

75
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.660
and As I Grew into my teenage years I
continued to gain weight on and on the

76
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.340
pounds came until I was well over 300
pounds come High School graduation

77
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.000
I didn't start losing weight at all
until I went on a crash diet during film

78
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.639
school since I could barely afford rent
let alone Three Square meals a day I was

79
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.360
only taking in about 400 calories and
even on that stranded in the mountains

80
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.660
about to start contemplating eating your
friend's diet

81
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.620
I only lost about 20 pounds in six
months obviously there was something

82
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.580
wrong not only did I feel physically
horrible since asthma plus excess weight

83
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.960
does not equal a good time but I felt
emotionally horrible because I was now

84
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.780
22 had been out for a decade and never
had a real life boyfriend I dated guys

85
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.039
online but never showed them anything
but my face in the rare occasion that

86
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.419
they'd see my midsection
six months of talking would go out the

87
00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.680
window as I got blocked

88
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.400
so I felt like garbage and decided to
find out what was wrong there had to be

89
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.080
an imbalance somewhere in my body so
when I moved home after film school I

90
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.860
made my doctor send me for every test he
could think of for any condition that

91
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.039
could lead to weight gain or difficulty
losing weight

92
00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:53.639
everything came back fine I was
perfectly healthy except for the extra

93
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.199
120 pounds I was carrying around so he
sent me to a new dietitian and three

94
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.400
months later following her direct meal
plans I'd gained back the 20 pounds I'd

95
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.680
lost in film school and then some again
I was told that I must be cheating and

96
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.620
not following the plan
the plan was white rice steamed chicken

97
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.300
with water or black coffee
with a multivitamin my mom thought it

98
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.220
was crazy for doing it but I had never
in my life been thin not for one day

99
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.000
even at Birth I weighed more than
average and I would do anything to be

100
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.900
able to try on a shirt in a store and
not have to walk out of there feeling

101
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.039
horribly embarrassed because the triple
XL wouldn't button I spent another

102
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.940
decade dieting going to the gym
regularly counting calories and watching

103
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.319
my weight fluctuate between 60 pounds
past clinically defined morbid obesity

104
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:49.020
and 80 pounds past clinically defined
morbid obesity a new doctor eventually

105
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.759
put me on a weight loss medication
a daily injection which works by making

106
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:58.319
you so sick to your stomach that you
simply can't eat I shot myself up every

107
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:02.340
day for months not taking in nearly
enough food to be considered healthy I

108
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.180
tolerated the side effects like extreme
nausea and constant shortness of breath

109
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.780
which was actually an allergic reaction
to the shots but I wasn't about to tell

110
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.560
my doctor that because this was supposed
to help me lose weight this is just how

111
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.460
toxic the need to lose weight is I was
willing to endure an allergic reaction

112
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.639
to a very powerful drug just to try to
lose weight

113
00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:27.139
I lost those 20 pounds again

114
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.599
but that was it
finally I'd had enough

115
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:37.500
after my mom passed away she left me a
little money so I was gonna take that

116
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.580
plus my own Meeker savings to have
weight loss surgery

117
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.540
specifically gastric sleeve surgery a
procedure in which they remove the

118
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.339
majority of your stomach shaping it into
roughly the size and shape of a banana

119
00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.480
irreversible and well known for
complications like acid reflux so bad

120
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.800
that you may need throat surgery within
a few years

121
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.959
but I was sick of being fat
I was sick of being ignored by every man

122
00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.740
I ever found attractive I was sick of
feeling like a charity case anytime

123
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.800
anyone I knew said that I looked good
so I booked the surgery paid the deposit

124
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.880
booked the flight since the surgeon
doing the surgery was halfway across the

125
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.600
country
and started on the all liquid diet that

126
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.620
leads up to the procedure
after all of that I started to ask

127
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.300
myself
am I gonna go under the knife

128
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.640
get a surgery with potential lifelong
complications risk death on the

129
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.600
operating table for the approval of men
who may very well be some of the biggest

130
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.380
[ __ ] in the world
was I really doing this

131
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.420
did I think so little of myself that the
opinions of headless torsos on Grindr

132
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.820
could send me to a surgeon who would
change the way my body worked forever

133
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:59.100
so I swallowed the cost of the deposit
and I canceled the surgery

134
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.519
since then I've been doing research into
how this happened to us

135
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:07.320
how did our entire Society become so
obsessed with lean and toned or muscular

136
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.660
bodies it wasn't always this way
so what happened

137
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.320
the answer might seem
very out of right field

138
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.779
the answer is
capitalism

139
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.899
and fascism

140
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.339
[Music]
Okay so

141
00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:38.760
capitalism is a simple one you can
easily connect the dots to how

142
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.720
generating a sense of culture that
drives people to desperately conform to

143
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.940
a body ideal can result in someone
making a profit but fascism

144
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.620
that's going to take a little bit of
explaining in the culture of today

145
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.240
I don't really like talking about
fascism I have to talk about it however

146
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.779
because I'm learning that analyzing
media in this day and age inevitably

147
00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:05.040
results in hosting a discussion about
fascism that's just the culture we live

148
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.260
in as a wise woman once said thanks
I hate it but one of the difficulties

149
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.160
about talking about fascism and sorting
media into categories of what does or

150
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.959
does not support neo-fascist ideology is
that fascism itself is hard to describe

151
00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.279
because a definition of fascism does not
really include the way that fascism is

152
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:28.320
as much of a process of government as it
is a method and a model the history

153
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.560
class description of fascism as
communism is the far left and fascism is

154
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.279
the far right it's a little bit too
simple even though the word fascism

155
00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.420
comes from the Italian for bundle of
sticks much like another f word it

156
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.620
represents a concept that is actually
notoriously difficult to Define for

157
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.240
instance in 2013 a right-wing newspaper
that had supported fascists in the past

158
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.079
published an article claiming that the
United Kingdom independence party a

159
00:11:55.079 --> 00:12:00.240
British right-wing party was fascistic
however a center-left newspaper

160
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.680
proclaimed that compared with the Golden
Dawn party in Greece who do have fascist

161
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.300
credentials and other Fringe parties
evident in hard-hit areas of the EU the

162
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.440
United Kingdom independence party is
pretty mild so basically centrists say

163
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.760
just because something Walks Like a
fascist talks like a fascist and

164
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.079
actively says it's a fascist doesn't
mean that it's really a fascist how

165
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.100
fascist is fascist enough to be
considered fascist we seem to treat

166
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.720
fascism like an asymptote where there's
a point where a political group May

167
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.620
throw out any number of flashy red flags
but it's impossible to collectively

168
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.240
label them as fascist culturally we have
decided that the Nazi party of Germany

169
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.320
was fascist which means that it doesn't
matter how a political body May draw

170
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.540
cues from the Third Reich as long as it
is not the Third Reich as it manifested

171
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.940
from the late 1920s to early 1940s in
Germany it is not fascism using the Nazi

172
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.360
party as the gold standard of evil has
consequences like this by treating them

173
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.639
as this sacred measure of Maximum evil
we have a standard by which if something

174
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:08.160
is not as bad as the Nazis
then it's fine or at least tolerable or

175
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.160
alternatively when something is as bad
as Nazis it is taboo to acknowledge it

176
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.899
and for that reason we cannot discuss
Rwanda or Sarajevo or any number of

177
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.959
massacres that have happened in the last
century because it makes us

178
00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.920
uncomfortable to think that the Nazis
weren't just a one-off fluke of evil

179
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.779
political Evolution Stalin for instance
was responsible for far more ethnic

180
00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:34.200
cleansing than Hitler was and a third
consequence is that we cannot treat

181
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.700
contemporary Nazis as seriously as we
should right-wing pundits who have spent

182
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.180
their entire careers comparing every
liberal and Democrat to Hitler have

183
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.320
suddenly done a complete 180 we have
self-identified Nazis openly walking

184
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.519
around with swastika armbands but the
culture does not condone violence

185
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:55.740
against these Nazis because they're not
the real Nazis part of this is due to

186
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.459
the fact that our functional definitions
of fascism are rooted in anecdotal

187
00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:04.560
examples of where fascists appear
usually in retrospect because as

188
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.820
demonstrated you could call yourself a
fascist while still being ignored it

189
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.320
really shouldn't be so surprising
that's self-identification

190
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.459
isn't enough for us interest a
re-evaluation of fascism would require

191
00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:21.000
us to remove it as a method of
government and more so focus on the ways

192
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.959
that Fascist governments enforce their
ideology and the kinds of values from

193
00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:31.260
which fascist ideologies emerge so often
we are told what fascism is what it

194
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.720
looks like why it begins why it's bad in
our essentialist thinking we look for

195
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.040
those specific markers the swastika
armbands the skull and crossbones the

196
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.660
Hugo Boss and we don't take these
markers and consider how they could be

197
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.279
reapplied into a contemporary context to
me I think the what and why of fascism

198
00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:57.000
are less important to identify than the
how and the who who is fascism promoting

199
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.279
as the good guys who are the bad guys
who should the public idolize and how

200
00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:06.120
does the governing body enforce these
values but these are much more abstract

201
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.139
and unquantifiable than listing a
collective set of characteristics that

202
00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:14.760
manifest in fascist States or how
fascist states are eyes for instance one

203
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.060
of the more common assumptions about
fascism is that it limits the Public's

204
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.380
freedom of speech and that is true the
government wants to control how the

205
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.920
public thinks so they restrict what the
public can say it makes it more

206
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.699
difficult to spread ideas that may not
align with how the state wants the

207
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.600
masses to think and no freedom of speech
does not apply to being able to say

208
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.720
whatever you want on social media just
like a store manager can have you

209
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.380
escorted off the premises for violating
profanity guidelines a private business

210
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.420
can block what you can express on their
social media platform freedom of speech

211
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.579
simply means the government cannot
persecute you for saying whatever you

212
00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:55.320
want about it with your mouth it was
designed to protect the Press so that it

213
00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.000
could accurately report about the
government in America there are no

214
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.740
official exemptions to freedom of speech
however in Canada the Charter of Rights

215
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.000
and Freedoms also include freedom of
speech but this Freedom does not extend

216
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.199
to hate speech that may Target any
particular ethnic racial religious or

217
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:17.519
sexual minority at least in theory by
literal definition this would mean

218
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:21.180
Canada is more fascist than America in
this regard

219
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.260
however in practice this is abundantly
untrue and of course by removing fascism

220
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.880
from its existing definition we run the
risk of over saturating it to the rest

221
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.899
of the world suddenly any encroachment
of someone controlling your actions

222
00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:37.740
becomes fascism which if you let your
brain pickle in this kind of nonsense

223
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.279
for too long you run the risk of
irreversible brain smoothing otherwise

224
00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:45.600
known as libertarianism but the problem
remains if everything is fascism then

225
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.000
nothing is fascism funny enough insofar
as political movements go we can put a

226
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.720
soft start date on Fascism and yes this
is going to lead into what body image

227
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.639
has to do with it I promise fascism as a
coherent form started in Italy under the

228
00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:03.779
leadership of Mussolini in 1919 after
the infamous march on Rome and with the

229
00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:09.600
help of the conservatives in 1922 he
came to Power by 1925 1926 his

230
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.839
government had quickly become a
dictatorship all of this happened after

231
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.900
the first world war which many Italians
didn't want to join in the first place

232
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.459
on top of that Italy was facing a crisis
because it wasn't industrializing fast

233
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:24.260
enough this led to a period of
revolution known as the two red years

234
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.500
basically a two-year period when
socialists were gaining ground in the

235
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.520
country because of horrendous working
conditions but the fascist reaction

236
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.380
quickly drowned out this radical
left-wing government in 1919 there were

237
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.120
only a few true Italian fascists however
by 22 they had won the support of the

238
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.299
rural bourgeoisie and were running large
parts of the country

239
00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:48.419
by the end of that same year the
national fascist party had a quarter of

240
00:17:48.419 --> 00:17:51.900
a million members when Mussolini's march
on Rome happened big businesses

241
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.100
conservative politicians and the Army
decided to give power to the fascists

242
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.880
wholesale instead of giving it to the
Socialists who were far more popular

243
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.140
among voters this made it possible for
Mussolini to become the leader of Italy

244
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.520
in 1922. but fascism as a way of life
was just as contradictory as it was an

245
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.360
idea this happened because fascists in
power were being pulled in three

246
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.539
different directions conservatives
joined the party because they wanted a

247
00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:19.260
more authoritarian version of the old
system they wanted the pyramid scheme of

248
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.280
feudalist power just without the
infighting brought on by the Myriad of

249
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.539
city-states there were also nationalists
who wanted even more authoritarianism

250
00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:32.220
without more violence and there were
also more radical fascists who wanted a

251
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.940
second violent revolution Mussolini
eventually sided with the most extreme

252
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.320
fascist Group which is something we're
seeing play out in American right-wing

253
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.400
politics right now if you begin leaning
into radicalism but you don't side with

254
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.240
the most radical group
you become a Target the centrists have

255
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.160
the ability to just leave in this case
the Italian conservatives but this is

256
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.780
applicable to all governments if the
centrists leave their positions even if

257
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.740
they can't stand the far right that
would mean giving more political power

258
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.140
to the left also not unlike Republican
voters refusing to vote for Democratic

259
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.640
candidates against absolutely
abhorrent Republican ones because they'd

260
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.400
rather elect the Devil Himself than
someone who wants to protect their

261
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.539
Medicare and Social Security

262
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.320
anyway basically the beginning of
fascist ideology can be seen as a

263
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.080
rejection of the modern Progressive age
inclusivity bad it became a coherent

264
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.400
ideology of extreme conservatism in
Italy and then emerged in Germany after

265
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.280
a period of Crisis but was only allowed
into Power after the rich permitted and

266
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.880
facilitated it
fascism

267
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.380
capitalism okay yes but
what does that have to do with being fat

268
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.140
foreign
[Music]

269
00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:00.000
there are several patterns you see in
fascism when we decide to spot it rule

270
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.080
of one figurehead hero worship Master
race purging undesirables etc etc we've

271
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.740
been to this Rodeo before we talk about
all of these things all of the time but

272
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.400
if we're looking at patterns of how
totalitarian regimes deploy fascism

273
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.960
there are some other weird patterns
there's usually a focus on Art and

274
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.940
ideals of beauty and this is where we
can arguably see fascism most clearly

275
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.620
when the state uses force and
manipulation to consolidate the public

276
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.480
interest around A single standard of
beauty this other major tenet to Fascism

277
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.400
is and this was especially true for the
Nazis something we might today call Body

278
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.720
fascism which is simply defined as
extreme views of how somebody should

279
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.020
look especially what shape and size they
should be

280
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.980
grinder this is present throughout all
forms of fascism but especially the ones

281
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.760
based around the myths of Scandinavia
the Nordic Superman the area and the

282
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.840
Ubermensch which is most of the fascism
that has spurred on the men's rights

283
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.559
groups around North America and Western
Europe even though the vast vast

284
00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:02.039
majority of them do not fit the
description of what they would describe

285
00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:07.380
as the ideal male body which focusing so
much on the ideal male body kind of

286
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.640
sounds pretty gay to me if you ask me
granted the blonde-haired blue-eyed

287
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.120
poster boy for Nazi propaganda befits
even a contemporary model for

288
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.640
desirability this could one day be you
or your son your nephew the Nazi party

289
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.740
very strongly Associated itself and its
success with physical Beauty so though

290
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.740
the perfect male body has been an
element of fascism from the very

291
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.600
beginning never was it more prevalent
than in Nazi Germany because Hitler was

292
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.380
obsessed with the art of Classical
Greece to understand what I mean just

293
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.919
watch the famous opening sequence of
Lenny riefenshaw's two-part film Olympia

294
00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:45.600
which documented the Berlin Olympics to
a soundtrack of dramatic music the

295
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.919
camera pans across the ruins of the
Acropolis before lingering on several

296
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:54.860
celebrated ancient sculptures offered up
as ideals of beauty and artistic prowess

297
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.280
eventually against a misty backdrop we
see one of the most famous Greek

298
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.260
sculptures of all a statue of a stooping
naked athlete preparing to hurl a discus

299
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.400
its surface glistening with oil as
though ready for competition the

300
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.559
sculpture suddenly Fades away in its
place appears a living athlete adopting

301
00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:18.659
the same pose slowly he starts to swivel
back and forth before hurling his discus

302
00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:22.860
with all his might the chilling message
is presented with Stark poetic

303
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.580
efficiency
the glories of Classical Greece are

304
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.140
reborn in Nazi Germany Professor Ralph
Michael Schneider of the Ludwig

305
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.640
Maximilian University said without the
classical tradition the Nazi visual

306
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.659
ideology would have been rather
different the perfect Aryan body the

307
00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:44.700
white color of the marble the beautiful
ideal white male to put it very bluntly

308
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.320
it became a kind of image of the master
race and that's what the Nazis called

309
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.720
themselves but Olympia isn't the only
place that we see the ideal Nazi body we

310
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.039
see in most of riefenstahl's propaganda
films to be fair slim but defined not

311
00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:03.720
too muscular as that would be unsightly
the ideal man was close to six feet tall

312
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.940
clear white skin clean shaven with
little to no body hair for examples

313
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.100
please see Calvin Klein ads the fascism
here or the fashy elements aren't the

314
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.700
presence of a beauty standard as I
mentioned with Greece there have been

315
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.960
very strong Beauty ideals for all of
mankind funny enough the Greek standard

316
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.860
favored the chunkier sturdier men the
Slimmer statues Were Meant To Be

317
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:31.500
associated with youth boys but where the
Nazis differed is just how specific the

318
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.400
beauty standards were it was like you
needed a textbook to really sort out all

319
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.780
the nuances this was mostly because Nazi
propaganda was facilitated on the myth

320
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.220
of the Aryan race and
that the Aryan race was inherently

321
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.600
Superior by genetic determination in
order to do this the Nazis required very

322
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.320
strong visual indicators to demonstrate
that the German man was stronger

323
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.760
heartier and most importantly more
beautiful leaning heavily into

324
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.500
phrenology the now debunked study of the
various elements of how the skull was

325
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.860
shaped being an indicator of personality
traits specifically intelligence

326
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.240
mythologically speaking and this was
part of Hitler's domestic policy the

327
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.860
Aryans were the descendants of the Gods
specifically the Acer they prided

328
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.000
themselves on looking the part
furthermore due to the fact that a fat

329
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.720
German man spat in the face of their
Master race propaganda there was a

330
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.760
precedent for punishing those who did
not conform to these standards there

331
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.260
have been plenty of historians who have
even postulated the idea that Ernst Rome

332
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.400
Hitler's gay BFF while he rose to power
and the man who ran the progenitor of

333
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.320
the SS the sa was executed not because
of Hitler's anxieties or himmler's

334
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.299
disdain for gay men but
because he was fat and therefore didn't

335
00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:50.159
fit the ideal image of the Aryan man
which honestly kind of checks out nor

336
00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:52.860
would it be the last time that the Third
Reich shot itself in the foot because

337
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.460
something practical didn't line up with
their aesthetic philosophy if Hitler

338
00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.500
himself was a homo I think it would be
starkly on brand for him to purge the

339
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.559
only competent member of his cabinet
because no fats no Femmes

340
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:08.640
retrospectively
probably for the best suffice to say

341
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.299
with the brown shirts out of the way
Hitler had carp launched to sculpt his

342
00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:16.860
own hot gay boy summer I mean secret
police and the Nazis did do whatever

343
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.880
they could to make sure that the SS the
face of the party

344
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.559
would be a very pretty face these
perfect Nazi soldiers became a trademark

345
00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:29.940
of the regime across the world as the
globe suffered from malnutrition due to

346
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.720
the food shortages of the Great
Depression or fattened up because the

347
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.340
only food readily available was nutrient
poor and extremely high in carbs seeing

348
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.659
these svelt attractive Germans marching
down the streets of Berlin and newsrails

349
00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:48.179
created an air of inferiority for many
especially in America which in no small

350
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:52.260
amount contributed to the massive
signups when America joined the war

351
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.539
remember America was attacked by Japan
not Germany but American boys across the

352
00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:02.940
country signed up to fight in Europe
they had to show these perfect Germans

353
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.720
that they weren't so tough and as it
turns out they weren't

354
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.320
and the Allies won the war and half as
much time as it took America to realize

355
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.279
the Iraq War was a lost cause but like
any time Americans go traveling in

356
00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:16.919
Europe
they make sure to bring home some

357
00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:23.460
souvenirs mostly Nazi scientists but
also they brought back body fascism you

358
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.559
see before World War II a lean muscular
body was not idealized in fact by many

359
00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:33.419
it was looked down upon if someone had a
ripped toned body it meant they were a

360
00:26:33.419 --> 00:26:37.020
physical laborer a gardener or
construction worker someone who didn't

361
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.779
have enough money to not have a ripped
body

362
00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:44.220
because physically intensive jobs were
the only ones that uneducated poor

363
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.500
people could get in fact softer unfit
bodies to a degree were considered more

364
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.919
attractive because it meant that person
had the money to buy lots of food but

365
00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:57.240
the fat had to be well distributed all
around the body not just the belly

366
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.340
because belly fat was a sign that you
probably ate a lot of cheap bread or

367
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.659
drank a lot of cheap beer and really
skinny bodies meant that you couldn't

368
00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:09.659
even afford the cheap bread so you're
probably going to die soon but after

369
00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:15.020
World War II
that all changed

370
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:24.419
[Music]
suddenly being healthy wasn't a priority

371
00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:30.059
it was being fit not strong
fit look at Charles Atlas who for a long

372
00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:33.840
time was considered to have the best
body in the world today we'd probably

373
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.460
say he has a dad bod because he'd look
fat next to the Rippling abs of

374
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.480
Instagram models how did this come about
well soldiers coming home from World War

375
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.740
II had seen the ridiculous bodies of
Nazi soldiers and Nazi propaganda and

376
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.880
the mythical bodies that Nazis held up
as Perfection and thought Oh I can do

377
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.140
better than that and so a small subsect
began trying to attain these bodies

378
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.279
creating diet plans low in carbs high in
protein with lots and lots of exercise

379
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:03.360
there was a bit of a distraction once
the Cold War started up because the

380
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.779
enemy didn't look like the Ubermensch
Soviet soldiers were always shown

381
00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:10.799
bundled up in winter jackets so seeing
how fit they were was kind of hard so it

382
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:15.360
had far less of an impact on the psyche
of the western Army boys but the idea of

383
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.220
gorgeous male physiques started floating
away from the military in the decades

384
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.440
following World War II since America was
busy shipping off anyone without flat

385
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.059
feet to fight Wars in East Asia instead
it drifted toward the well-off the rich

386
00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:34.640
the bourgeoisie because your typical man
wasn't working in labor jobs anymore

387
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.240
attaining strong muscles and ripped ABS
instead they were standing on production

388
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.220
lines or sitting in offices growing
flabby so appearing soft was now

389
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.299
associated with the middle class so the
rich began working out creating a market

390
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:52.799
for personal trainers fancy diets and
exclusive gyms while off Housewives now

391
00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:57.000
wanted to look like the women on their
TV sets Farrah Fawcett or Suzanne

392
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.120
Summers fascism sets the cultural
anxiety

393
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.980
capitalism uses it to make a buck and
then in the 1980s with the Reagan

394
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.000
Revolution and the popularization of
commercial debt everyone felt like they

395
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.140
could be as rich as the carringtons or
colbys so everyone started hitting the

396
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.340
gym and fitness centers took off as one
of the most profitable businesses of the

397
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.820
decade and it wasn't just because people
were signing up for a year-long

398
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.399
membership on New Year's Day and then
giving up

399
00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:28.500
people actually went the 1980s was a
decade of excess and excessive dieting

400
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.580
and exercise was no different one of the
reasons cocaine was so popular was

401
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.140
because it suppressed your appetite and
gave you more energy but gay men had

402
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.159
been way way ahead of the curve on the
diet and exercise thing we'd been

403
00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:45.539
hitting the gym heard since the 1950s
partially because when our gay soldiers

404
00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:49.799
went over to Germany and saw the sexy
German soldiers we didn't just want to

405
00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:54.419
beat them
we wanted to be them we didn't want to

406
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:59.100
be Nazis not necessarily
well we ignored the ones that did

407
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.659
in the 1960s and 70s you were far more
likely to see gay men with defined abs

408
00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:08.100
and pecs than straight men it was even
considered a way for straight people to

409
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.059
spot us if a man at the beach looked
like he lived at the gym he was probably

410
00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:14.940
gay
because not only were we trying to

411
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.840
attain these bodies for ourselves but
the gym was a great place to find other

412
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.159
people trying to attain those bodies
a great place to hook up straight men

413
00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:28.559
were actually worn away from going to
gyms in major cities because you never

414
00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:31.799
know what might happen in the locker
room yeah

415
00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:35.039
queers and locker rooms have been a
straight scare tactic for just that long

416
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:39.539
and then after the rise of AIDS gay men
wanted to look as ripped as possible so

417
00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:44.640
as to not appear sick since people with
AIDS especially Advanced AIDS tended to

418
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.880
have muscle wasting we even started
using steroids because some witch

419
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.120
doctors in New York and La started
telling gay men that steroid use would

420
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.679
slow down the progression of the virus
and then as a community gay men just

421
00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:59.820
kept up with the same regimen we go to
the gym and eat crazy diets despite not

422
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.620
having to show that we're not dying we
go to the gym despite being able to hook

423
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:10.260
up just about anywhere because
we still want those perfect Nazi Soldier

424
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.399
bodies whether we call them that or not
but those soldiers were paid and

425
00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:19.740
required to look like that but a switch
has flipped within the community it's no

426
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.159
longer that we find those bodies an
attractive option and would like them

427
00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:27.179
for ourselves now if you don't have that
body you're worthless

428
00:31:27.179 --> 00:31:34.080
you're shunned you're subhuman
sound familiar and we say well you can't

429
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.740
shame people for what they're attracted
to

430
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:42.600
but we do shame people who say only
whites in their grinder profile or

431
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.640
whatever combination of disgusting
racial screening tactics they may use so

432
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.799
why not shame those who actively
perpetuate an unhealthy body standard as

433
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:58.500
I mentioned before research shows that
social demands placed upon gay men to

434
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.880
eat healthy and achieve a perfect body
are linked to anxiety and depression and

435
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.480
have serious mental health consequences
a gay fitness instructor told GQ

436
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.820
Magazine working in this industry I can
tell you that looking good is not enough

437
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.320
anymore for some gay guys
they don't just want to look good they

438
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.279
want to look the best to illustrate his
point he said he has clients who started

439
00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:25.020
off doing basic bicep curls in front of
the mirror but are now competing in

440
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.740
fitness-based competitions like Turf
games and Crossfit a gay friend said to

441
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.580
me that it's hard to look [ __ ] these
days he said and I guess he's right

442
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.840
there are so many fit guys out there
that some guys feel the need to step up

443
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.679
their game in order to feel visible
accepted and appreciate it if they're

444
00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:44.940
not addressed
queer men's body image issues can easily

445
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.919
magnify into more serious mental health
problems severe depression among gay men

446
00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:55.559
has actually increased since it's become
more acceptable to be out because now

447
00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:59.159
that the world sees what some gay men
look like the impression becomes that

448
00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:02.340
all gay men must look like that and if
you don't

449
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.480
well you better get to work this has led
to the abuse of steroids and illegal

450
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.419
drugs to try and build muscle and
satiate appetites anorexia and bulimia

451
00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:16.860
and even giving up
with suicide we hold up certain body

452
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.760
types as the goal and even the
expectation for what beauty inside the

453
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.080
gay community is but not everyone can
achieve those bodies no matter how much

454
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.799
they diet or work out and not just
because biology sometimes works against

455
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:32.940
you like with thyroid issues and rare
food sensitivities this past summer I

456
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.899
found out that I lacked the enzymes
required to properly digest

457
00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:42.000
carbohydrates which meant my body was
holding on to every last carb I ate

458
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.659
the long delayed explanation for why I
couldn't lose weight no matter how

459
00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:49.440
healthy I ate the condition is called
hyper rental anemia

460
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.640
and I also have a generalized
carbohydrate intolerance it turns out

461
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.539
it's incredibly rare and related to
diabetes

462
00:33:57.539 --> 00:34:01.200
surprise I have that family history and
I've been warned by doctors since my

463
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.159
teens to be on the lookout
it's not diabetes though it's just

464
00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:09.320
diabetes adjacent it was

465
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.060
one of the strangest feelings in the
world after I'd been dismissed by nearly

466
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.260
every medical professional as just
cheating on diet plans to after three

467
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:25.399
decades on this planet be informed that
there is an actual reason for it

468
00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.879
I have to try to not think about what my
life would have been like if any doctor

469
00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:33.839
or dietitian had decided to run the
weird tests

470
00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:36.839
instead of just telling me to eat less
and exercise

471
00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:40.440
maybe the reason it's so rare is because
doctors are

472
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.580
well they can be very quick to say that
you being fat is the root of all your

473
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.960
health problems when in reality maybe
being fat is just a symptom of the real

474
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.919
problem I was lucky enough to have a
doctor who looked at my chart listened

475
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:56.580
to me when I told her what my diet for
the last 10 years have been like that

476
00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.460
even when I was doing the starving
student thing I still lost almost

477
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.599
nothing she looked at my medical records
and said I want to bring you in for one

478
00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:06.960
more test
the medical community itself is stuffed

479
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.160
with very fat shamey sentiments only
they don't call you fat they call you

480
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.000
unhealthy now I don't want to generalize
all doctors like this but from someone

481
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.320
who has gotten the same shade from a lot
of them the medical community is very

482
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.000
rooted in promoting beauty standards
given how slim their BMI charts are I'm

483
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.599
pretty sure the overwhelming majority of
people are either overweight or obese

484
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:32.460
I'm not sure which SS twink they used as
a gold standard but there is some

485
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.200
seriously unrealistic expectations about
what a body should be

486
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.460
how many teenagers develop Eating
Disorders just because they stepped on a

487
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.900
scale in their doctor's office and they
lean right in to meal plans and

488
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.560
Specialists and dietitians supplements
and shakes some of the more enterprising

489
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.859
doctors will even have spas or wellness
centers and will push their diet

490
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:59.400
subscriptions onto their patients which
that isn't illegal but it sounds like it

491
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.420
should be we are told to trust doctors
and many of us do

492
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.500
that's a lot of power given to someone
who's trying to sell you what may very

493
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.400
well amount to snake oil
and doctors have a very easy time

494
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.359
diagnosing someone as fat especially
given how many tests and Hoops they make

495
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:19.859
you jump through to get anything else
diagnosed it's easy for someone to make

496
00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:22.920
money off of fat people when the entire
culture they live in drives them into

497
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.119
crippling anxiety and puts them under
extreme pressure to just not be fat

498
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:31.320
anymore especially when the culture has
a more limited ideal of body standards

499
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.000
not even Perfection on some of my
infrequent foyers into heterosexual

500
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.079
social media it is plastered with
cringe-worthy declarations about what

501
00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:44.579
the opposite sex should be and yes it
comes from men and women

502
00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:49.320
because neither group
really knows how the other group's Body

503
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.859
Works

504
00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:01.079
[Music]
okay somebody's got to say this gay men

505
00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:05.460
are not alone there are a horde of
ladies out there who do think that it is

506
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.040
perfectly reasonable to expect men to
have that Superhero body all the time in

507
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.900
fact ten acuerta the mcu's Namor came
under a degree of criticism for not

508
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.400
having the body you know the one that
Captain America has ironically not from

509
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.060
the gays who thirsted after him his nose
rang and his man pearls from the get-go

510
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.960
these were women and straight men who
were upset

511
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.359
about his back oh well more for us at
least for the gays we have groups that

512
00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:37.800
tolerate a range of ways to be fit or
attractive and the more thick fellows we

513
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.240
depict as sexually appealing in media
the more we will seek that desirability

514
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.220
in real life conversely Warner Brothers
Executives in 2021 at least the ones who

515
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.520
were there at the time were having a
collective meltdown leading up to the

516
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.940
release of the Batman it turned out
Robert Pattinson was struggling to put

517
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.380
on the bulk that Christian Bale had
because they wanted to have that

518
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.060
shirtless Batman shot and Pattinson did
look good for his obligatory shirtless

519
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.220
sequence but it was far from what stood
out most in the movie in my opinion

520
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.880
I don't think the world's greatest
detective and Ninja

521
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.960
needs to look like Brock Lesnar but back
to Namor the matter of the fact is that

522
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.720
Neymar's body isn't really something
that would feel out of place on a rugby

523
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.619
field it was a subverted expectation for
the swimmer's body he has in the comics

524
00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:27.599
which I think is perfectly okay but that
said it wouldn't make sense at all for

525
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:32.640
any aquatic superhero to have dehydrated
ABS the swimmer's body is for some

526
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.540
reason the body type that the gays and a
lot of straight guys default to

527
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.920
author and queen Eric Shaw Quinn has
said there's not enough swimming pools

528
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.220
in Los Angeles for all the men who say
they have a swimmer's body personal

529
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.000
trainers and training apps get this kind
of request all the time as if people

530
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.200
think they can just morph their body
like that sorry but that in itself would

531
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.160
be a superpower people's bodies are the
way they are and they can't control the

532
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.599
distribution of muscle mass or their
bone structure there is a version of fit

533
00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:04.260
that they can accomplish
but it might not be a swimmer's body

534
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.760
another thing that happens is skinny
guys wish they could bulk up to have a

535
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.260
rugby build which also probably cannot
happen

536
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.099
there's a kind of athletic determinism
when it comes to Fitness we look at

537
00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:22.320
swimmers and say all that swimming has
given him a swimmer's body but the truth

538
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.579
is actually the inverse the person had
the right kind of body to be able to

539
00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:31.380
succeed in competitive swimming
it's more accurate to say that he is a

540
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:36.240
swimmer because he has a swimmer's body
this isn't always the case but in most

541
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.079
cases people tend to gravitate to the
sport that they do because their body

542
00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:44.520
type thrives in that environment whereas
a thicker or chunkier guy would struggle

543
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.960
in the water because he's not built to
accommodate fluid dynamics and the

544
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.300
health industry preys on this
they will make these promises and they

545
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.660
will take your money and then another
Health industry will be happy to take

546
00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.260
your money when you get disillusioned
with the first one that's how the

547
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.579
industry is built
fascism

548
00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:09.119
capitalism but again
some bodies aren't designed for ripped

549
00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:14.700
six-pack abs
some people will always be a bit bigger

550
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.660
like me
Even After figuring out after 25 years

551
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.839
that my body really was working against
me

552
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:25.500
I know that once I do lose the weight
I'll never look like those Instagram

553
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.859
models and I'll probably never live up
to the expectations of some of those

554
00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:32.339
headless torsos on Grindr
but

555
00:40:32.339 --> 00:40:37.079
I'll be able to go into a store and buy
a button-up shirt that fits

556
00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:40.740
I'll be able to go for a run without
feeling like I'm about to have a heart

557
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.339
attack
I won't look like what the expectation

558
00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:49.500
is for multiple reasons my head is too
round my chest is too broad my legs are

559
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.640
too thick as much as it would break my
teenage self's heart I'll never be a

560
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.300
twink
and that's okay

561
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.440
you shouldn't have to look a specific
way to meet the bare minimum body

562
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.500
standards for this community
[Music]

563
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.599
so I think a healthy way to move forward
is to aim to be exactly that

564
00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:13.020
healthy
as a community that should be our goal

565
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.160
not ripped but healthy
make that the standard for the community

566
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.520
and that'll even take some of the
pressure off of the gym bunnies and

567
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.119
hopefully end the epidemic of Eating
Disorders the queer men have been

568
00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:30.660
suffering from for decades fight back
against the rising tide of body fascism

569
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:36.000
because fascists suck
why would you want to look like the type

570
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.960
of person
that Hitler thought was perfect
