00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.520
hello everyone my name is James and
welcome to gay geek theory today I would

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.510
like to talk about something that I'm
calling the Stonewall effect or maybe

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.509
the Stonewall film effect as someone who
has gone to film school worked in the

4
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.140
film industry and then also gotten a
business degree and worked in marketing

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.930
I feel like I have a pretty good view of
the film industry from you know from a

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.120
distance a very far distance like
surface of the Moon on October 31st

7
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.050
distance Hollywood has always had a
love-hate relationship with the LGBT

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
community
though we may dominate certain sections

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.950
of the behind-the-scenes world gay men
drag queens and lesbians were only

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
peppered throughout early cinema not
really in major roles but we were

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.379
visible like Marlena Dietrich and
Morocco this gender-bending bisexual

12
00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.640
scene turned a lot of heads when the
film came out in 1930 the characters

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.899
were usually played for laughs but we
were still represented we were there on

14
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.159
the big screen and you could tell it was
encoded or subtle those characters were

15
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.920
gay gay gay gay gay gay and really movie
goers didn't seem to mind

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.250
well most movie goers anyway you see
movies were getting crazy or at least

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.509
that's what the religious Rite thought
showing violent sex and questionable

18
00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.470
moral behavior we're an easy way to get
people talking about a movie and then

19
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.130
getting their butts in theater seats but
a lot of Catholic and Protestant groups

20
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
just weren't having it and through a
series of threats that have had entire

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
books written about them they forced the
film industry as a whole to start self

22
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.350
censoring lest they become chained to
the moral hem of those opinionated

23
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.240
Christians and so the Hays Code was
introduced named after William Hayes

24
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.070
doesn't he look like a happy fella to
begin censoring movies violence could no

25
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.430
longer be shown without the perpetrator
getting has come up and somehow death

26
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.659
jail and repenting to God were all
accepted outcomes nudity was a big no-no

27
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.500
there was no reasoning with them on that
front and sexuality could only be shown

28
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.100
between married or committed couples
again unless you show those horndogs

29
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.929
being punished for their nasty sex in
some way basically all the fun was taken

30
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.450
out of the movies this was when mobster
movie started to reel

31
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.050
take off because you could show all the
violence you wanted but since the main

32
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.420
characters probably died in the end it
was okay

33
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.989
oh and homosexuality was outright banned
in the beginning shocker

34
00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.590
I know but clever writers and directors
figured out ways to get gay characters

35
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.750
in the movies again just in a more coded
veiled way even movies as big as Ben Hur

36
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400
the 1959 version written by gay writer
gore Vidal included some homoerotic

37
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.390
subtext though it was inserted without
the knowledge of lead actor Charlton

38
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.709
Heston who would say it didn't exist
until the day he died and for the most

39
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.620
part things basically stayed that way
until the Hays Code started falling

40
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.579
apart in the 1960s movies like The
Children's Hour the producers and

41
00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.060
Midnight Cowboy started appearing
Midnight Cowboy even won Best Picture

42
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.440
despite its ex rating from the MPAA
which it got for a gay [ __ ] scene

43
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.299
then in 1970 came the boys in the band
which was the first big Hollywood movie

44
00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.670
that featured an all-gay cast of all gay
characters it was pretty big deal at the

45
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.930
time it would be a pretty big deal today
we showed up here and there throughout

46
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.430
the 1970's and early 80's but nothing of
note the gave hannah kicked in about

47
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.850
halfway through the 80s when AIDS was
known as the gay cancer and gays became

48
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.799
Hollywood's best new villains we were
psychotic evil bloodthirsty a whole

49
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.739
group of Jeffrey Dahmer's each and every
one of us or we were dying of AIDS so we

50
00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.540
were either dying or killing what had
great decade the 80s were but then Bill

51
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.170
Clinton was elected president after 12
long years of Republican rule in the

52
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.160
White House and Hollywood started to
ease up on us gays a little bit other

53
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.799
than Silence of the Lambs which the gays
were not happy about

54
00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.910
I might make a whole other video on that
suffice to say we bitched about nothing

55
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.650
the 1990s gave us some pretty solid game
movies Priscilla Queen of the desert to

56
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.829
Wong foo thank you for everything Julie
Newmar The Birdcage Philadelphia my own

57
00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.290
Private Idaho 1997 alone gave us wild
Kiss Me Guido in and out and gay

58
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.030
inclusive films like as good as it gets
Boogie Nights in The Full Monty in 1999

59
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.630
we got the talented mr. Ripley boys
don't cry and cruel intentions I know

60
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.470
not exactly happy portrayals of gay
characters but representation

61
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.190
nonetheless things were looking up and
with the dawn of the new millennium

62
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.370
queer as folk became one of the most
talked-about and eventually one of the

63
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.310
most profitable TV shows in television
history

64
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.730
by the end of its run queer as folk
actually had to add an extra 15 minutes

65
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.040
on to its hour because so many people
wanted to buy commercials that doesn't

66
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.760
even happen now
then came the Bush administration and

67
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.780
gay representation at least from
mainstream Hollywood studios seem to dry

68
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.919
up sure we got the hours which didn't
turn a profit and some independent fare

69
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.000
like Mambo Italiano and monster again
not exactly a positive portrayal and I

70
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.990
guess you could argue that Chicago is
pretty gay and that Frodo and Sam might

71
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.350
have had something going on the down-low
but you'd be reaching for the first few

72
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.370
years the closest thing to a gay movie
that any major Hollywood studio put out

73
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.320
was x-men 2 gay director Bryan Singer
slathered the mutant as gay metaphor all

74
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.270
over that movie but just like the Lord
of the Rings in Chicago its subtext and

75
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.140
we're looking for plain simple text here
then Along Came 2005 I like to think of

76
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.680
2005 as a test case for queer cinema
first up rent a rock opera about

77
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.060
straights gays and bisexuals living and
singing together an AIDS infested early

78
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.550
90s New York City cost forty million
dollars to produce and made 31 million

79
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.890
dollars at the worldwide box office
here's some box office info you may not

80
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.860
actually know theaters take about half
of the money that a movie makes so a

81
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.539
movie needs to make twice as much as its
budget in order for the studio to break

82
00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.979
even and that's not even counting the
cost of advertising the movie so when

83
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.350
you look at it that way rent was an even
bigger bomb next we have Capote 7

84
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.490
million dollar production budget with a
worldwide box office of just under 50

85
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.630
million okay now we're talking nothing
to write home about but at least it

86
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.030
turned a profit Hollywood is a business
after all and they love making money

87
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.729
finally we have Brokeback Mountain a
movie people are still angry about not

88
00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.690
winning Best Picture at the Oscars this
movie is sometimes credited as being the

89
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.220
moment a lot of Americans realize that
gay people can actually love each other

90
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.130
and it's not just about sex made for 14
million dollars it brought in a hundred

91
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.630
and seventy eight million dollars at the
worldwide box office

92
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.410
those are the kinds of numbers that
Hollywood likes to see but here's the

93
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.750
thing
looking at 2005 from a business

94
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.060
standpoint Brokeback Mountain is the
outlier Capote did well yes but not

95
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.230
anywhere beyond what other movies of its
ilk were doing at the time or now

96
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.790
meaning Oscar bait movies and of course
rent was a total bomb so Brokeback

97
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:07.450
Mountain was the was breaking the rule
that gay movies don't make money so what

98
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.110
would happen
well Hollywood would test the gay

99
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.780
community in 2006 we got running with
scissors based on the best-selling book

100
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.060
of the same name producers were hoping
for a big return sadly it was a terribly

101
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.590
made movie and it bombed producers and
executives didn't see a bad movie that

102
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.680
lost money though they saw a gay movie
that lost money in 2009 milk won two

103
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.180
Oscars but failed to turn a profit so
now that we've got some contacts let me

104
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.060
get to the reason why I call this the
Stonewall effect with the Stonewall film

105
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.680
effect the next time Hollywood as a
studio system put real faith behind a

106
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.350
gay movie was 20 15 10 years after
Brokeback Mountain directed by Roland

107
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.860
Emmerich the movie did what every
historical movie has done and

108
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.070
whitewashed the story
it wasn't drag queens gay and

109
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.730
transgender people of color who started
the fight for gay rights it was a pretty

110
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:10.660
blond boy from Kansas or Nebraska one of
the flat states because of this there

111
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.260
was a fierce campaign against the movie
online boycotts were planned and what

112
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.680
Hollywood hoped would turn into the
first gay blockbuster turned into a

113
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.000
massive tax write-off making only a
hundred and eighty seven thousand

114
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.810
dollars worldwide yeah missin a few
zeroes there guys so what is the

115
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.190
Stonewall film effect it's when a gay
movie fails because of a reason other

116
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.539
than being about gay people Hollywood
executives however don't see that they

117
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:43.719
see a gay movie that lost money they see
a gay movie being protested gays

118
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:49.870
boycotted Silence of the Lambs in 1991
but it made 272 million dollars so it

119
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.400
wasn't the boycott that made Stonewall
fail it was because it was about gay

120
00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.040
people audiences obviously don't want
gay movies maybe a supporting character

121
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.200
and a cheap rom-com or chick flick here
and there but no lead roles you see

122
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.280
every gay movie that fails fails because
it's a gay movie but every gay movie

123
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.760
that succeeds succeeds for a different
reason

124
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.550
case in point The Birdcage starred Robin
Williams at his prime Philadelphia

125
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.090
starred Tom Hanks won him an Oscar
Brokeback Mountain had two of the

126
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.470
hottest actors in Hollywood and happened
right after George W Bush started his

127
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.940
campaign against gay marriage so there
is a little sympathy now I'm not saying

128
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.580
these are the reasons that these movies
succeeded but this is what Hollywood

129
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.890
executives tell themselves so where does
that leave us well as a gay man who

130
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.540
would actually like to see some major
gay characters in movies I'm at an

131
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.670
impasse from a business standpoint my
view is that we meaning the LGBT

132
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.870
community should go out and see every
movie that features LGBT characters

133
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.120
whether they're gay men lesbians
bisexuals or transgender people see them

134
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.490
all every one of them in theaters and
buy the blu-ray no matter how terrible

135
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.170
they are but James that means Hollywood
will just keep making bad gay movies ah

136
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.540
that's the counter-argument and you know
if we support movies like Stonewall

137
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.950
which white wash and sis washed history
Hollywood we'll just keep making movies

138
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:31.720
like that fair argument and history kind
of backs you up to a point

139
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.110
for decades african-americans were
portrayed in two ways in movies

140
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.490
dangerous criminals or slaves that was
it it's like the scary butch Dyke gay

141
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.490
best friend or depressed transgender
person stereotypes the LGBT community

142
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.170
hates but eventually you got the
blaxploitation movement in the 1970s

143
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.340
which despite its name sound and kind
of- actually went a long way in

144
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.480
introducing audiences to strong black
characters shaft and Foxy Brown for

145
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.580
instance were they great movies not
always sure we look back and cringe at

146
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.420
some of them now but they laid the
groundwork for movies to star Eddie

147
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.540
Murphy in Denzel Washington in the 1990s
and Mabel

148
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.310
money doing it and then that laid the
groundwork for more overtly black movies

149
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.709
like the Medea series in the 2000s in
the 2010s which then laid the groundwork

150
00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:24.790
for Black Panther a 200 million dollar
superhero movie with an almost all black

151
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:31.000
cast taking place in a technologically
superior African nation no step-in

152
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.790
Fetchit s-- here our main character a
superhero is a king so where's our gay

153
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.560
superhero they do exist
Marvel's wicked and hulling DC's

154
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.259
Midnighter and Apollo so where are they
well they remain relegated to the pages

155
00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:51.220
of limited yet popular comic book runs
because we meaning the LGBTQ community

156
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.670
haven't shown the Hollywood executives
that were willing to spend our money on

157
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.899
gay movies we need to deal with the bad
gay movies like running with scissors

158
00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:03.699
rent and yes maybe even Stonewall line
up around the block to see them support

159
00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:07.180
them and put our hard-earned dollars
into the bloated wallets of Hollywood

160
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.040
executives because when they see bad gay
movies succeeding they'll start buying

161
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.750
up those good gay movies whose
screenplays get ignored in 2016

162
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.600
moonlight a gay and black movie was made
for 1.5 million dollars people heard it

163
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.760
was good we heard it was good and we
went it made 65 million dollars

164
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.430
worldwide for a movie about a gay black
man that's pretty good I'd say it's

165
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.459
exceptional actually if you look at the
box-office performance of other movies

166
00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:41.949
like that so we've got one Oscar winning
box-office hit on our hands first time

167
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:47.470
since Brokeback Mountain 10 years ago
over 10 years ago so what are we gonna

168
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.360
do now this time are we going to ignore
the next LGBT inclusive movie because it

169
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.709
wasn't made exactly like we wanted it to
be are we going to swallow our hear in

170
00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:02.230
queer pride and support LGBT cinema even
when it's not great because remember it

171
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.970
took a lot of slave movies and terrible
comedies to get to black panther so

172
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.529
let's show hollywood we mean business
the next time an LGBT inclusive movie

173
00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:16.660
hits a theater near you go take friends
see it twice even if you hate it because

174
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.130
if it makes money we might just get a
gay superhero movie in the next

175
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:27.310
years or a Stonewall movie that actually
tells the truth if gays have shown

176
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.240
anything it's that we're good at forcing
otherwise slow processes to speed up

177
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.840
change in Hollywood can make change in
Washington look damn near supersonic

178
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.250
unless there's money involved you want
gay movies you want lesbian heroes

179
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.110
bisexual leading man
a transgender superhero let's put our

180
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.050
money where our mouths are and support
gay cinema even the bad ones you've got

181
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:59.200
to start somewhere and after a century
of cinema we're still at the starting

182
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.110
gate so what do you guys think I'd love
to hear your opinions on this so leave
