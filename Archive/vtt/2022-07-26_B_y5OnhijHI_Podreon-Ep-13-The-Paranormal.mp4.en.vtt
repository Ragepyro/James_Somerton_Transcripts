00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.960
hello everyone and welcome to the latest
episode of the padreon episode 13. my

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.120
name is james i'm nick and today we're
going to be talking about

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.519
all things paranormal and spooky because
it's the 13th episode

4
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.000
spooky like it's not even a halloween
episode

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
so like we're just kind of well no but
you know like aliens ghosts

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.439
uh spirits spirits fairies things like
that

7
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.039
um
so i guess we'll start off with the most

8
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.480
obvious which would be

9
00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.920
have you had any
other worldly experiences i'm kind of a

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.280
bit of a pragmatist when it comes to
like sort of my deconstruction of the

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.500
world but like so that's a no no it's
it's a

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.840
[Music]
i guess there are rational explanations

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.840
for some of the things that i've seen
and witnessed but like

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.120
at the same time it's kind of like a i
want to believe situation well we're

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.399
just really getting off to a the full
story off the bat like no buildup or

16
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.720
anything um
well yeah it's very much like

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
i want to believe but i need proof i
think

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.200
is how
you're coming at it yeah yeah i'm

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.360
willing to take a little bit more on
faith and like i do kind of spiritualize

20
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
around like the possibility but like
i have a hard time kind of convincing

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
myself that something is the case if
there isn't like any

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
rational evidence for
right um i mean like if i'm in an echo

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040
chamber with a bunch of you know mystics
that might change because i'm very

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.240
susceptible to like overempathizing with
people in their life experiences yeah um

25
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.079
and see that's that's the interesting
thing with me is that and i'll get into

26
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.560
this i'll talk about it and tell some
stories

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.520
there are
some

28
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.280
kind of creepy paranormal instances
that i've experienced myself and that

29
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.119
have been experienced by direct members
of my family

30
00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.880
um very close friend family
and yet i am very

31
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.840
skeptical
about the existence of ghosts and

32
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.000
spirits and things like that whereas
nobody i know has had any kind of

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.680
contact with aliens
but i 100 believe that aliens are out

34
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920
there i'm roughly the same way i i'm
skeptical when it comes to aliens have

35
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.480
visited us
yeah

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.640
because the question is why would they
come here

37
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.360
like if they why would they come here
and then disappear why would they come

38
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440
here and like it depends on the kind of
society that aliens live in but like

39
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.800
either we're in a really inconvenient
part of the galaxy or it's kind of just

40
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.760
a hands-off approach when it comes to
interact with new life because imagine

41
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.480
how we interact with new life and we can
see this

42
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.280
we step on it basically typically um and
that's true fatally and literally like

43
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000
you know look like look what have
happened to southern pacific islands

44
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.120
when america's industrial revolution
came to a head after the first world war

45
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.200
um didn't like
didn't the world's average temperature

46
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.959
drop because
the american expansionist military

47
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.599
killed so many like murdered so many
islands in the south pacific like just

48
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.239
completely slaughtered the um
i don't know yeah just complete like

49
00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.080
going going dark already multiple
genocides yeah like on various islands

50
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.680
in the south pacific that has all sorts
of stuff to do with aliens and ghosts

51
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.239
well just talking about like how would
we

52
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.159
based on how we interact with other with
new things how would aliens interact

53
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.519
with new things
um and like that is to say like well the

54
00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.120
question aliens would evolve would have
evolved or kind of developed from like a

55
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.480
kind of vicious animal like chimpanzees
or like whatever monkeys we came before

56
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.080
us like
well that's and my kind of

57
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.920
i guess we're gonna play skeptic and
believer here

58
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.480
um
my kind of thought process on that is

59
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.840
because a part of me is like why would
they come here we're not special like

60
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.840
they've obviously figured out like
faster than light travel if they can

61
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.879
travel you know between galaxies and at
least solar systems yeah um

62
00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.080
because like contrary to people believe
we can't observe planets in other solar

63
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.040
systems we don't have telescopes
powerful enough to actually observe

64
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.599
these planets we can only deduce their
existence mathematically and because of

65
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.519
like blots against stars and stuff
um but like

66
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.320
so they're obviously like they would
have to be super advanced to have that

67
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.800
kind of technology
um

68
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.080
and so the question is like well why
would they come here because we're

69
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.479
obviously not advanced it's like
why people looking at ants why would we

70
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:38.000
alone be worth the trip but but
my kind of theorizing about that is that

71
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.919
it's kind of
checking in on your science experiment

72
00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.199
like if you take the ancient aliens kind
of

73
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.400
look into things that you know the
aliens kind of helped society move along

74
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.800
um

75
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.960
that you know the that

76
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.000
things like that and that's kind of
indicative of uh once again going to the

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.320
south pacific in the american military
of uh cargo cults that arose in the yeah

78
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.479
yeah yeah uh in the second world war
when america would use indigenous

79
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.680
islands as ammo supplying depots
um and then the american military left

80
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.160
and then to this day the inhabitants of
these islands continued to carry on

81
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
um american uh drilling uh rituals yeah
i like drilling practices like they have

82
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.600
their wooden like rifles that they carry
over their shoulders and then kind of

83
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.520
conduct these marches well yeah because
they you know these people showed up and

84
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.919
they became gods to them because they
were bringing

85
00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.840
food and supplies and so you know like
yeah and so it's it's like i think it's

86
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.720
the carl's again quote
carl sagan carl sagan any significantly

87
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.230
advanced technologies indistinguishable
from magic yeah um

88
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.280
[Music]
and so it's like

89
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.960
you know were these were the gods like
the whole ancient

90
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.520
ancient ancient atheist ancient alien
hypothesis is

91
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.319
that the gods of mythology were actually
aliens because they had a hat you know

92
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.919
the gods have a habit of coming down
from the sky especially because like we

93
00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.639
look at even technology that we're
developing in a modern sense look at the

94
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.759
ipad there are myths of ancient gods
that had stone towers tablets yeah had

95
00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.440
scrolls that could access all the
information on the planet yeah and even

96
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.680
some myths about like these great i have
that on my wrist exactly and also even

97
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.960
um uh ancient cultures that look at
these ancient artifacts like mjolnir or

98
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.680
um other sort of or other weapons that
have incredibly specific uses but

99
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.000
require but have this um component of
energy drain like they they lose their

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.520
energy after a time and need to go to
someplace else else to recharge them

101
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.199
yeah um and so those components are kind
of there too yeah um

102
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.400
that's like i i don't disbelieve the
ancient aliens theory

103
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.400
um i want to open with that but i i
don't i read through uh chariot of the

104
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.199
gods i think most of it's bs
oh it's mostly you know crazy nonsense

105
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.840
but the the the basic because most of
the book if you've read it is just like

106
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.199
whack-a-doodle stuff yes but the basic
idea

107
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.039
of
the

108
00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.120
mythological gods being aliens i feel
like

109
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.919
isn't entirely out of the realm of
possibility yeah because if you know the

110
00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.520
aliens show up and it's like this very
primitive species of you know 15 20 000

111
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.599
years ago and they're like you know kind
of here's agriculture here yes so like

112
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.759
was here's how to make a brick was earth
an island halfway between

113
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.080
two
two alien species that were warring with

114
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.960
each other
or was it you know is there just sort of

115
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.880
an alien species out there that's kind
of traveling around and like oh nomadic

116
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.599
sort of thing yeah and kind of like
we've got stuff and you people are sad

117
00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.039
and
you have no food and you're die you're

118
00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.800
gonna die and we need to give you stuff
the interesting thing about that is that

119
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.879
um all of these uh ancient cultures and
these ancient myths had a kind of

120
00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:01.440
starting point around the era of
mesopotamia um and a lot of other myths

121
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.199
can be derived from that like a lot of
groups written myths anyway like there's

122
00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.680
plenty of myths like christianity and um
hebrew mythology is derived from

123
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.759
zoronastro
yeah um

124
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:17.440
which i'm not sure if that was the
religion of ancient mesopotamia but

125
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.319
which zoryastrianism actually has a god
and a devil and a jesus and it's like

126
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.520
it's all there
um and like when you look into it it's

127
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.199
like wow
that's really

128
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:33.120
there are a lot of parallels to in
ancient egypt also yeah like a lot of

129
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.560
the stories that kind of propagated
through europe and you know you you can

130
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.919
even go into uh the norse mythology and
there are a lot of parallels between

131
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.880
that and the hellenistic
gods um some even saying that odin was a

132
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.040
direct inspiration from hermes
um i've read some callers read some

133
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.880
scholars right yeah um so like i don't
think it's entirely out of the question

134
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.920
that earth could have been visited by
an alien

135
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.399
body um and that's why people i think
that sometimes you know i think

136
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:10.080
the you know the ufo sightings and stuff
where we see these odd shapes that move

137
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.600
really fast like faster than anything
we've created can move and things like

138
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.480
that
and it's like oh it's a weather weather

139
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.240
balloons don't move like that yeah um
like that kind of stuff i'm like maybe

140
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.000
they're kind of checking in sort of
thing yeah because

141
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
my kind of theory is like if if aliens
ever visited us in ancient times sorry

142
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.320
i'm going to sneeze in half a second so
give me a minute

143
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.279
uh
uh it's coming eventually but i'll keep

144
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:37.200
talking until it does it starts a
sentence to interrupt himself with a

145
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.440
sneeze
no a prelude to a sneeze uh

146
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.000
the prologue
um

147
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.880
like if aliens didn't visit us uh
as ancient aliens

148
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.000
um if that's not true then i think
settings of ufos if they are aliens

149
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.040
they're most likely probes like in the
same way that we send probes to other

150
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.800
planets to other solar systems um well
we don't send probes to other solar

151
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.440
system we kind of aim them in a general
direction and hope they get i hope they

152
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.519
get there yeah none of them have gotten
there yet or um

153
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:13.200
so we realized oh wow our solar system's
actually really big yeah um yeah

154
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.560
and so
i i think that those sightings more

155
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.519
about that but then again wouldn't they
be closer to deep space than they would

156
00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:24.160
be here like are alien probes observable
to us um

157
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.120
are are they close enough to be
observable yeah is the question because

158
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.480
like if they are suffix if aliens are
significantly more advanced than us then

159
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.000
they would be able to absorb uh have
observational technology that is

160
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.120
significantly more advanced and could
observe our planet from farther away

161
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.320
observe our planet but i feel like you
know entering the atmosphere to kind of

162
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.160
see what people are doing and one of the
misconceptions that a lot of people have

163
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.959
is that you know it's it's an american
thing

164
00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.760
that you know it's it's like you know
baseball or something like that it's

165
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.720
it's
sightings of ufos is just an american

166
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.519
thing it's like no actually it's pretty
global and has been for a very long time

167
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:03.920
funny story crop mathematic making
mathematic crop circles is kind of a

168
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.680
cultural tradition in the uk yeah like
in farm fields a lot of them just

169
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.560
appeared of nowhere sometimes people
take credit for them sometimes they

170
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.279
don't um
but yeah interesting business another

171
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:19.519
thing i don't know if you've read this
lately but a earth picked up a very

172
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:23.760
suspicious satellite frequency from the
center of the galaxy i did read that

173
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.320
yeah um and this is unique in the sense
that these are very specific bursts of

174
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.880
energy uh very powerful bursts of energy
and they are very

175
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.240
it's not as uh random as it is when
they're picking up just random space

176
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.160
radiation so that's interesting and one
of the things that makes me suspicious

177
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.920
about it and and like i don't think
there's a you know the corpse of a gray

178
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.279
man in area 51 or anything like that
like i don't i don't think we have like

179
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.480
gotten some ufos and
and stuff

180
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.959
but like one of the things that does
make me suspicious is that all the ufo

181
00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:59.519
stuff
um

182
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:04.399
you know it really started to propagate
in the 50s and 60s

183
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.880
when people started to get home movie
cameras like they were eight millimeter

184
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.760
cameras and
people would have them and they're like

185
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.120
there's a thing in the sky
um

186
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.680
is that
the governments of the world universally

187
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.720
said
you're crazy

188
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.760
and
instead of saying

189
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.440
let me look into that it was just you're
nuts yeah go away

190
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.760
go away crazy person
and only recently oddly under the trump

191
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.279
administration they said okay we're
actually going to look into it now under

192
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:40.560
the biden administration they're saying
like yeah we are actually going to put

193
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.399
some put some dollars into this because
it is kind of suspicious it's us yeah

194
00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:51.760
it's very sus among us uh yeah
um is there an imposter in the human

195
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.880
race
and so it's kind of i find that

196
00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.720
suspicious that the governments around
the world were just like nope okay so

197
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.639
weird alternate theory
what if those mysterious things in the

198
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.600
sky or those mysterious sightings what
if they're not aliens

199
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.680
what if
those are like supernatural actual

200
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.360
vehicles of earth gods
like what if we're looking at this from

201
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.720
the wrong angle we're looking at this
from a science fiction angle rather than

202
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.760
the fantasy angle what if all of these
sightings around the world what if

203
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.360
they're not aliens what if it is like
human living myth like human spirits

204
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.959
i mean
what if they're us

205
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:35.279
like literally us from you know
two thousand years from now time travel

206
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.839
something like that like coming back
yeah like

207
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:41.199
there it's
you know there's really no telling like

208
00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:44.000
and i don't the other thing i want to
get i don't think anyone's actually been

209
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.079
abducted
um because i feel like aliens if they

210
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.839
have the technology to travel through
basically light speed they have the

211
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:56.160
technology to figure out what's going on
in us by like scanning that's true

212
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.680
um
what about that town in alaska there's a

213
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.120
specific town in alaska and um mila
jovich was starting a movie

214
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.480
yovovich
oh i'm so sorry mila um i really like

215
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.720
her um she's a peach
seems to be

216
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.040
no i'm just saying talk a bit louder
okay yeah i

217
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:23.040
um i thought you were telling me to sit
up straight which also probably would

218
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.199
help probably um
anyway yeah there's a specific turn in

219
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.720
alaska that reports more alien
abductions per year than any other place

220
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.720
in america or maybe even the world well
that's alaska it is alaska island

221
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.350
it's palin country can see they can see
russia from their house

222
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.839
[Music]
russia is also another really big place

223
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:51.279
for like alien sightings i mean russians
i know

224
00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:55.760
but like it's it's
the other interesting thing is that

225
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.279
alien sightings
usually happen

226
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:06.639
in wide open spaces
you never get abductions happening in

227
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:10.320
manhattan
yeah so it's kind of like maybe they're

228
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.839
if they're if abductions are happening
they need room to land well also um if

229
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:19.440
you're an alien in manhattan and and
you're gonna abduct sounds like an 80s

230
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.959
movie alien in manhattan i think it
might have been actually

231
00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:26.800
um i'm thinking of the movie what was my
favorite martian

232
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.440
that was that was a tv show okay
um alien in manhattan like like a

233
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.440
werewolf in london um
like

234
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.639
you're an alien and you want to abduct
someone are you going to go to one of

235
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:43.600
the most densely populated areas of the
planet where literally millions of

236
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.440
people in a couple square miles could
see your spaceship or you're going to go

237
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.440
to the hicks in montana the stakes in
montana and the other thing that like

238
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.800
that kind of brings to mind is why would
they care

239
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.680
that's my my that's kind of my
philosophy towards alien objections why

240
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.399
do they give a crap yeah like why would
they be like oh we've got to be

241
00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:04.240
secretive about this
we have light speed technology or

242
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.759
intergalactic travel space folding stuff
and these hicks can barely get together

243
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:14.160
a gun if we're not
and if we're not as advanced as them why

244
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.199
would they be interested in us is the
thing like why would they be so

245
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:22.079
observational like if we're if they want
us to enter a galactic society they

246
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.639
would do that in a way where they could
control us

247
00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:28.480
um and sort of make sure that we're not
going to you know start any wars with

248
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.880
everyone else in the galaxy um as i'm
sure we would um

249
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.030
yes
make earth great again

250
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.000
[Music]
don't you miss when earth was the center

251
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.399
of the universe
we can make it that way again oh my god

252
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:47.920
science fiction
science fiction republican wants to

253
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.720
completely destroy the laws of physics
to make the entire universe revolve

254
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.800
around earth i'll remember when illegal
aliens just met mexicans

255
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:03.360
um
but yeah so the funny thing about mass

256
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.760
effect i i i was a horror one thing that
bothered me the most about mass effect 1

257
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.120
is that there's a bunch of humans that
have recently joined this ancient

258
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.039
galactic civilization that has been
present for hundreds uh thousands if not

259
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:19.679
tens of thousands of years um where on
their space station capital city calling

260
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:24.720
everyone else aliens
i was like bioware you can do a bit

261
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.039
better

262
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:33.760
but yeah i'm always interested
it's weird i i love the concept of the

263
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.559
ancient aliens thing just that it's like
that they're that because

264
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:44.559
the the super skeptics who are like no
aliens don't exist

265
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:48.080
you know there's not enough goldilocks
zones blah blah blah you don't know that

266
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.640
first of all it's depressing the idea
that the only life in the galaxy is

267
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.000
earth yeah
like this is it i mean this is as good

268
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.400
as it gets to the skeptics i'd like to
remind you that life on this planet has

269
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.000
been eradicated five separate times like
not just like i don't know it's not

270
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.559
eradicated there's been stuff left
complete eradication life has evolved

271
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:12.960
from nothing stuff left there's been
those the amoebas well yeah like

272
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.440
single-celled organisms things that
manage to survive when nooks and

273
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.000
crannies like this world has survived
multiple extinction level events and yet

274
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.720
it has bounced back yeah um that that's
reason enough for me to say that you

275
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.679
know on at least five other planets in
the universe that there is life there

276
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:32.799
i mean i think there's thousands i'm
saying

277
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.919
at least yeah
like because it just it does it

278
00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:39.120
mathematically
when you look at the amount of solar

279
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.480
systems in galaxies
galaxies it's insane well yeah that's

280
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.039
what i mean like the solar systems like
people think the milky way is our solar

281
00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:52.960
system no the milky way is
thousands of solar systems and then

282
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.840
there are thousands of galaxies bigger
than the

283
00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.400
milky way hundreds of millions of stars
i didn't realize just how massive this

284
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.000
universe was until i played a game
called elite dangerous and it really

285
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.919
kind of shows you the scope i don't know
it show that game is fantastic i just

286
00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:12.160
love that the the the reference is a
video it's a video game because it makes

287
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.480
the distance in the universe visceral
and even like uh light tr like um

288
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.320
traveling between stars and traveling
within solar systems it's an arduous

289
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.640
journey to do either yeah um and you
need resources to do these things even

290
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.320
in this life speed uh this ftl society
um and just for how distant planets and

291
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.360
solar systems are from each other and
how distant stars are from each other

292
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.880
and how many stars are shoved into this
galaxy yeah like you know like there's

293
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.919
star wars which has light which is lit
the map is literally galaxy spanning

294
00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:43.840
there's an outer room there's an interim
an elite dangerous it's only one pocket

295
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.840
of stars that we're in
um like it's one little tiny little

296
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.760
chunk of the galaxy that's in and all
that has this massive mythology of this

297
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.799
kind of game of thrones political
mythology um taking place around this um

298
00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:01.360
couple hundred thousand stars that we're
inhabiting yeah um and that's really

299
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.120
interesting
yeah so yeah there's a lot of unexplored

300
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.760
space and space
well yeah like

301
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.440
like unexplored visually like they're
out of the night sky there's a teeny

302
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.200
tiny fraction of the amount of stars
that we've actually documented well yeah

303
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.880
and i mean because
you know our telescopes aren't that

304
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.679
powerful
we

305
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:27.440
can't actually see far away just because
the way that like light moves yeah we

306
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.039
can't see distance because at some point
we're seeing the beginning of the

307
00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:35.840
universe because we can't like
see that far away we haven't seen the

308
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.880
beginning of the universe but no but you
know what i mean we've had telescopes

309
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.880
that have seen farther enough into
distances time and space because

310
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.280
relativity but we've have telescopes
that have been able to see

311
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.720
past the point when stars started to
ignite yeah where it's just blackness

312
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.000
and we don't and i think that was
several hundred billion years and you

313
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.960
know you look up at the night sky and
each one of those stars has planets

314
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.039
and it's like and they're just the stars
that are visible to the naked eye yeah

315
00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:07.360
so it's like i i think you're kind of
crazy to say that there's nothing else

316
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.200
out there yeah that's that's that's
absolutist and there is we don't have

317
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.880
you don't have the evidence to make that
claim yeah i'm sorry you just don't like

318
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.120
i i think it's you know it's very
biblical thinking to think

319
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.280
that
and and kind of

320
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.039
full of yourself
arrogant to say that earth is the only

321
00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:29.120
planet with life yeah on the for the
sake of the the carbon-based light form

322
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.559
on this planet it's arrogance on behalf
of that like yeah especially like

323
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:36.000
planets that may have you know
non-carbon-based life forms

324
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.440
which you know is possible because i
think in california

325
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.480
we know that there's non-carbon-based
life forms because there's things that

326
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.520
exist in the deep oceans that aren't
carbon based um i think you know there

327
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.640
was an underground lake in california or
arizona where they found amoeba baseline

328
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.679
not amoeba-based life um arsenic yeah a
life based that was built off of arsenic

329
00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:02.080
yeah and i mean in the deep oceans like
that's i feel like that's more alien

330
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.080
than space
yeah we actually have documented less of

331
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.919
the deep ocean than the night sky yeah
um

332
00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:13.120
which just fascinates me because i'm
like oh the megalodon might be down

333
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.760
there which again you've got a lot of
room oh do you want to talk about

334
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.640
sightings there's lots of sightings of
sea monsters and that's been documented

335
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.360
throughout humankind to this day yeah
forever like you know like like we were

336
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.679
convinced that the giant squid and the
colossal squid were not real yeah until

337
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.679
they were yeah uh because you know
sailors talk because sailors are

338
00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:35.679
reputedly historically very unreliable
because you know they see whales and

339
00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:39.039
they think oh sea monster i mean granted
if you've ever seen

340
00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:42.080
right how did not say for what can we
get here

341
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.080
have you ever seen what uh
so when

342
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.080
large whales will sometimes get
erections and those erections will rise

343
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.200
above the surface and they look like sea
monsters oh yeah they look like

344
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.880
tentacles yeah yeah so like it's like
you know like i you saw what you saw but

345
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.559
you were mistaken about what you saw
yeah um and i mean it wasn't that long

346
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:03.679
ago that we didn't know that sperm
whales existed we thought they were

347
00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:08.559
monsters like we thought they were
biblical leviathans well yeah um sperm

348
00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:12.320
whales world's largest predator yeah
and

349
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.240
then we realized oh
they are a thing and then we started

350
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.039
hunting them for their supremacy
um because that's what we do

351
00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:24.880
um
but like enough about aliens and stuff

352
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.840
let's talk about ghosts ghosts ghosts i
feel like knowing your family there's

353
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.840
some ghost believers in your family
honey

354
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.520
honey not just ghost believe my
grandmother don't get her started she

355
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.000
will go off to on you about
when jesus arrived on this planet he

356
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.400
brought with him a different kind of
energy

357
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.039
um and this that was actually something
i it's this energy had different

358
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:55.520
vibrations that were completely new to
the human race

359
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.159
she's she's big into um
what's his face

360
00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:06.000
the famous edgar casey edgar cayce he is
huge into edgar cayce a lot of you know

361
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.840
like indian new help like authors deepak
chopra like i don't think deepak

362
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.480
covers anything strictly spiritual but
like

363
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.960
grandma grandmother has been into those
historically she's big into crystals

364
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.600
still to this day yeah a bit more
agnostic

365
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.640
she's she's she's
she is to new age like new age

366
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.720
spirituality um
what a lot of like agnostic catholics

367
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.679
are it's like but like what about like
ghosts

368
00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:37.840
like that's what i'm like ghosts and
spirits and i don't know if my family

369
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.279
would ever qualify them as ghosts as in
like they once belong these are the

370
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:44.640
spirits of dead people i think that they
believe in like

371
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.679
like pockets of energy that have
consciousness

372
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:51.279
um i think that's kind of like
paraphrasing from what my family would

373
00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:55.440
sort of describe using that kind of
vibrations and energy sort of discussion

374
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.799
like it's just pockets of energy that
have consciousness

375
00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:03.360
and it can be benevolent or
malicious or anything in between

376
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.640
um
and i actually don't dislike that as a

377
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.840
way of thinking about things yeah um
because like i i i am someone who is

378
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.240
very set i'm very empathic i'm very
sensitive to how people are feeling and

379
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.480
if you'll recall in our last apartment i
was convinced we were haunted by

380
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.039
something oh yeah i had these regularly
occurring nightmares i actually wrote

381
00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:28.960
one down and i wouldn't be surprised if
several people died in that apartment

382
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.840
specifically that apartment yeah um
it

383
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.279
there like there was there's a short
story i wrote on my website uh auntie

384
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:41.679
hercult.com
uh called the mirrors that is based on a

385
00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:44.880
dream that i had while i was under the
influences of

386
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.720
influence of perfectly legal narcotics
um

387
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.960
it was just weed that's not a narcotic
yeah it is no it's not it's narcotics

388
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.760
yeah narcotics are like
weed's not narcotics okay sure i don't

389
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.679
think anyway i'd think weeds in their
coffee i i took some weed and then i on

390
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:06.640
my way to sleep i had this half a week
half half a sleep dream

391
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.080
there's this straight i called him the
pig face man i called him the pig face

392
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.840
man because he seemed to have this kind
of melting pig mask on

393
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.840
um
[Music]

394
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.919
and like sometimes i've seen things in
my dreams i'm like okay i'll blow it off

395
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:23.760
it's just nothing
this thing it it felt like it had a

396
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.320
presence it was very malicious very
batman villain

397
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.799
yeah
um it it just

398
00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.840
and it kind of that's when i started
buying incense because i was like i i

399
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.720
started talking to my friends in the uk
and i just get rid of the bad judge i

400
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.480
was like hey you're kind of witchy tell
me what i need to do to get rid of this

401
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.960
and he's like well the easiest thing to
do is just buy some incense and see if

402
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.960
it goes away after that it did it worked
um maybe it was the placebo effect i

403
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.720
don't know yeah um i'm sad i can't smoke
incense anymore here because i like the

404
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.039
way it smells because it's kind of spicy
in the air

405
00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:55.360
um

406
00:26:56.159 --> 00:27:01.360
but yeah and like i i haven't seen that
figure here i've seen in dreams and kind

407
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.960
of like half asleep dreams like other
things here but i haven't really felt

408
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.480
particularly threatened by them yeah in
the way that like this thing i can't

409
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.880
describe it it was like it's like will
describing the the mind player like the

410
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.080
the kind of oh yeah just kind of yeah
the goosebumps on your back is like you

411
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.279
felt something was there yeah um and i i
don't remember if you remember this like

412
00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:25.200
i i complained about it for a while like
even when i wasn't like strictly asleep

413
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.440
like i was like there is something here
yeah um and then it went away and then

414
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.840
it came back after i stopped burning
incense for a while maybe it was the bed

415
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.799
bugs i wasn't unless that's the other
thing i'm like you know like i want to

416
00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:39.600
believe but at the same time i'm willing
to recognize that i was under a lot of

417
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.919
pressure in that place i was i was just
uh i was in school we had two rounds of

418
00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:48.240
bed bugs cockroaches yeah uh floods so
like i was not in a good place

419
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.559
emotionally that was at the end though
like i remember you saying like i feel

420
00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:56.880
like there's like a presence here long
before then oh interesting

421
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.080
um but like i have in in my family have
direct experience with

422
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.679
weird goings-on spiritual goings-on kind
of stuff like me personally

423
00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:13.520
when i was very very little like i'm
talking like two and three

424
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.640
um i would tell
everyone

425
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.600
that would listen to me anytime i got
near a body of water

426
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.960
that i drowned in a past life
you know a three-year-old saying that is

427
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.679
like
what is he talking about a past life

428
00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:32.159
what are you letting him watch um
i i know what you were watching when you

429
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:36.559
were younger not two or three two or
three i couldn't get through fern gully

430
00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:40.720
uh you need to watch that but like my
parents were always like oh that's a

431
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.399
little weird but you know it's whatever
and

432
00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:48.880
so it would always say no i i drowned in
a past life and

433
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.320
it was just kind of like a running joke
for a while

434
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.679
and then we were at this graveyard
that's near a um

435
00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:02.399
historic site on the island i grew up on
and it's

436
00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:06.559
this very old graveyard like hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of years old

437
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:11.279
and just walking around it was like a
sunday might and we were just like out

438
00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:14.080
for a drive
um

439
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:20.480
and i found this really old gravestone
and i called to my mom and i said mom

440
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.760
come here it's my grave
and i think i might have been like four

441
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.320
or five at this point probably four
so my mother kind of rolled her eyes and

442
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.279
came over
and saw

443
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:36.640
and it was james the last name gone
lost at sea

444
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.039
she freaked out ran back to the car and
was like never coming back here and this

445
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.200
is before you never you learned how to
read

446
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.880
oh no i know how to read okay
um

447
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.080
but like i
i mean like yeah i knew how to read when

448
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.559
i was about three or four like the first
name was james somebody was just saying

449
00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:56.720
like look it's the name is james this is
where this is where i am

450
00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.720
it was the lost at sea stuff and the
birthday

451
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.919
what was the birthday uh or the death
day the death day was my birthday oh

452
00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:09.760
um
and it was the newest grave in this very

453
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.200
old graveyard
um because the graveyard was now only

454
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.760
used for people who died in this area
and so the fact that

455
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.850
my birthday was the death day was what
freaked my mother out wow um

456
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.159
[Music]
the other really

457
00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:31.440
kind of close connection well there's
two other ones

458
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.520
um
is when my aunt was a teenager you know

459
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.480
she was like bad kid she would like go
do stuff and everything um

460
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.039
and she and a group of friends were
planning a trip

461
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:47.440
for
the weekend they were going up to the

462
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.000
the woods for camping
and on thursday night

463
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.080
she
woke up in the middle of the night and

464
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.039
she went out to get a glass of water
and

465
00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:00.559
her uncle
who was dead and had been dead since she

466
00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:05.360
was about five or six
was sitting at the table

467
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.880
and told her don't go with them
and

468
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.519
she like told everyone the next morning
like

469
00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:16.399
yeah i saw a ghost and they really calm
down

470
00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:21.600
so she was freaked out and she didn't go
they all died in a car accident

471
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.200
um
so like my family kind of has these

472
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.000
weird connections and the other one with
me

473
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.039
was in the summer between grades six and
seven i'll just get these out here

474
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:39.279
um in the summer between grades six and
seven um my family was at the cottage

475
00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:42.880
that um
i talked about in an earlier episode

476
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.880
reading the audiobook thing
um that we went to

477
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.200
uh most summers and we were there and i
had this

478
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.279
horrible nightmare like i would have
eventually i found out that there were

479
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:59.360
actually waking seizures
in that i would have that would cause

480
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.960
these dreams to be basically i'd wake up
and the dream would still be happening

481
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.240
um
but this nightmare that i was having was

482
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.240
that i was in a
city filled with ash and there were two

483
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.740
fires in the sky and it wasn't the sun
it was two fires yeah um

484
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.799
[Music]
and

485
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:21.120
freaking out saying there's gonna be a
big war like just and took forever for

486
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.039
my parents to calm me down
and

487
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:30.080
then so that was between grades six and
seven i started seventh grade and then 9

488
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.760
11 happened
and so i kind of do feel like there is

489
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.720
some kind of connection
to if it's a spiritual realm if it's

490
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:46.240
something that there is well keep in
mind some kind of being or other things

491
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.880
that kind of give us messages
but it's kind of it can't they're not

492
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.320
like
like this is another thing about like

493
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.960
going back to kind of aliens is like we
have a very limited idea of what god and

494
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.080
spirits and aliens are like when it
comes to aliens we think like mars

495
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.519
attacks we think uh little green men we
think like um even like even things like

496
00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.760
um

497
00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:15.039
not contact
arrival yeah um like those are kind of

498
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:17.360
like
that's the most out of the box aliens

499
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.919
that i've seen yeah um as far as also
kind of depicting what sufficiently

500
00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:26.399
advanced technology would look like uh
there's nothing to say that aliens would

501
00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:29.440
not exist physically that aliens
wouldn't have evolved from some kind of

502
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.679
energy uh collection and like a neuron
star or something yeah there's nothing

503
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:36.480
to say that you know interdimensional
travel is more feasible than faster than

504
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:42.399
light travel um well yeah like demand
like multi mult multiverse theory yeah

505
00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:45.039
like
yeah absolutely

506
00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:48.720
so like when it comes to that like when
when we talk about like there are beings

507
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.559
or gods out there like i don't strictly
believe that it's like a guy in the

508
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:56.640
clouds or like um a forest spirit
slipped into a pocket dimension like

509
00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.159
those are really cool and i'd like those
to exist but like

510
00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:02.720
um
[Music]

511
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.399
a concept of god or higher being might
also be a sort of another realm where

512
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:12.320
time doesn't exist the way it does here
or when where distance doesn't exist the

513
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.839
way it does here yeah um
and it's less a matter of like a being

514
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:21.839
or a consciousness and more a matter of
a reactive force that appears to have

515
00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:25.520
consciousness because it responds to
stimuli

516
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:31.839
and really are are we so different but
yeah that's that's uh semantics um

517
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:36.079
when it comes to that
uh there

518
00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:40.000
i i think a more significant amount of
events is like

519
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.440
weird occurrences on the planet that
have been happening for generations even

520
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:49.520
before aliens that we can't really
explain or reckon oh gosh excuse me or

521
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.800
reconcile um

522
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.760
uh
like the um the toronto werewolf thing

523
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.280
yeah
um and and for that i i would i once

524
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.359
again i want those things to be true i
want the world to be a little bit more

525
00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:08.400
interesting
chaotic

526
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:15.200
uh i think the world's plenty chaotic um
but i i i do love the idea that

527
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:21.359
you know these stories that we have of
vampires and werewolves and aliens and

528
00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:26.640
gods and witches and all that kind of
stuff that they are actually based in

529
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.240
reality yeah that there are and even if
these stories themselves aren't stickly

530
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.760
true or even if they don't accurately
they're embellished yeah that there

531
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.040
there is the presence of this kind of
this kind of hidden world out there yeah

532
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.599
because i don't
disbelieve in you know like witchcraft

533
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:46.880
and stuff like that like that there are
people who can do like minor forms of

534
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.520
witchcraft like tarot readings and
things like that a huge component of um

535
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.880
like witchcraft is not about is strictly
about like i'm going to cast a lightning

536
00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.560
bolt it's about developing
a spell that kind of changes alters um

537
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.040
events for someone very slightly yeah um
you know and like they're they're going

538
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.079
to drop their code they're going to
start dropping their toast butter side

539
00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:11.359
down consistently and it's always going
to be better side down yeah little ways

540
00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:14.560
to kind of uh screw around with
probability like or someone is always

541
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.400
going to you know
like a good one kind of like always

542
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.200
going to win the lottery but it's always
going to be you know like that five

543
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.800
dollar one yeah yeah like that kind of
um

544
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.920
i like well yeah when i i do have a few
friends who are into like witchcraft

545
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.160
stuff hence how i who i went to about
when i saw that the the pigface man yeah

546
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.480
um and he's put together a few curses
now and then to screw with people who

547
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.320
have wronged him yeah in various ways
and he says like you know it's not going

548
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.760
to be like they're not going to die it's
just they're going to be severely

549
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.839
inconvenienced for a while yeah as long
as the energy from the spell kind of

550
00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.359
keeps flowing out of the spell like it's
going to do that but like these things

551
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:57.130
are rarely permanent they're rarely
miasmas yeah um it's it is usually um

552
00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.560
[Music]
you know like okay your heel is gonna

553
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.119
break when you're stepping onto the bus
or something like oh okay i just i

554
00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:09.680
i had forgotten about this
um when my mom was first diagnosed with

555
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.640
cancer
and all the doctors

556
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.560
uh were saying like you know we're gonna
get this under control we're you know

557
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.839
we're gonna do chemo we're gonna do like
all the all the stuff that they had

558
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:26.480
planned um my
cousin mary you met her yeah um

559
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.560
she took my mom to like a fortune teller
tarot reader person

560
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.240
and so this was in

561
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.200
this was before she ended up in the
hospital in february so this was in

562
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.839
january this was right after her
diagnosis uh in january of 2021

563
00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:43.839
um
[Music]

564
00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:48.320
and she went to this fortune teller
person and they did a tarot reading and

565
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.079
my mom said asked you know am i going to
get through this

566
00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:56.240
and
the tarot reader did her thing and said

567
00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.400
okay here's the deal
you're not going to make it through this

568
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.119
but
when you go

569
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:06.079
you're not going to be in pain
and the people you love are going to be

570
00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.480
with you

571
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.920
and that's exactly what happened
um yeah i mean it's like you know the my

572
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.359
because it was assisted suicide and
everything my mother kind of you know

573
00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:21.839
self-fulfilling prophecy but you know in
january

574
00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:27.200
because of 2021 it was every doctor
saying we can nail this especially yeah

575
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.280
and then this one random woman saying
it's not going to work but you're not

576
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.880
going to be in pain and we can refute
that like people like often kind of poo

577
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.480
hoo fortune tellers and kind of be like
uh

578
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.200
they they just tell you what you want to
hear i mean like that's absolutely not

579
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.560
what your mom wanted to hear at that no

580
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.960
um but like there was especially within
two weeks is when she ended up in the

581
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.119
hospital in february yeah and so that's
when she was convinced like

582
00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:57.040
i'm not making it out of here yeah and
like i to an extent maybe that put your

583
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.000
mom that gave your mom some peace to be
able to move ahead and start actually

584
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.800
making plans
uh to

585
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.400
first i think so because she was very
proactive on that yeah um there was no

586
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.520
like i'm not going to plan it because if
i plan it it will come because there's a

587
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.359
lot of people who get sick and kind of
go through that she was like no i'm

588
00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:19.680
everything's gonna be signed and dated
and like in an epipedian sense

589
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.680
when it comes to what an opinion and
obedience

590
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.200
okay like you know like the concept of
um the guy

591
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.079
he was told a terrible fortune at the
oracle of delphi and because he was so

592
00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:35.680
pissed off that he heard this fortune he
ended up doing the things that made it

593
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:42.000
come true oh yeah yeah um edipedium in a
sense like that do you feel that uh sort

594
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.240
of fortune tellers and tarot and sort of
projecting senses of the future from uh

595
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.200
from a point of clairvoyance do you
think that the to an extent of that

596
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.520
becomes self-fulfilling prophecies
because your mom did make arrangements

597
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.160
to assure that she would not die
painfully and that she would be

598
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.920
surrounded by her loved ones um
and then and i mean she did do that

599
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.920
after the doctors finally came around
and said yeah there's no fixing this

600
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.040
yeah um
so you know like i said self-fulfilling

601
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.119
prophecy because it was you know
assisted suicide yeah um but one of

602
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:19.359
those granted it was supposed to be
assisted suicide with

603
00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:23.040
three people in the room yeah and it
ended up being a party right by

604
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.359
circumstance entirely by circumstance
yeah so that kind of happened outside

605
00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:31.119
completely outside of her control my
favorite things to explore in fiction is

606
00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:34.640
the relationship between which it wasn't
a party to be like yeah she's dead it

607
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.119
was like a life celebration yeah
um

608
00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:43.200
inspiration for the living wake movie
that james and a james nay

609
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.480
uh james live life live week live week
uh that we um we want to make one day

610
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.599
uh but like we ever get to oh stop it
one of my favorite because i i saw a

611
00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:59.200
fortune teller when i was
13 my friend kaley took me to one

612
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.760
um
and

613
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.880
the fortune teller said that i would be
fabulously successful and i'm still

614
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.160
waiting for that
so one of my favorite tropes i think

615
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.000
they might have been full of [ __ ] oh
[ __ ] off you are kind of fabulously

616
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.119
successful like you look like look at
cape breton standards

617
00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:23.040
by cape breton standard sure but like by
like you know my standards right and

618
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.480
we're going to work to that because
we're going to make movies and stuff but

619
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.319
yeah um
i'd love to learn tarot by the way how

620
00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:34.079
to read tarot well i buy you that crow i
know but i'm always nervous to research

621
00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:37.200
things on my own i'd rather be told i'd
rather have someone teach me how to do

622
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.760
it like on because like i'm sure there's
some witches in toronto absolutely um

623
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.440
toronto is one of i i'd another reason
to move toronto toronto is the weird

624
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.880
place in canada where all the weird
stuff opens up like toronto has a main

625
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:54.079
cafe uh what made cafe made cafe uh it's
like a japanese hooters but they dress

626
00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:57.200
in uh the kind of fetishized made
outfits

627
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.240
oh do they have male waders no oh um but
they look like hilarious good time

628
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.040
because they all do cat poses
there is a

629
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.960
bar
in japan or maybe it's a cafe

630
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.160
um
where there are a bunch of

631
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.960
you know beautiful boys walking around
who

632
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.119
just kind of like pin each other against
walls and like

633
00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:28.160
just as like you are surrounded by yowie
basically yeah

634
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.280
toronto is the place in canada where
those kind of stuff things would happen

635
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.040
yeah
um want to learn tarot yeah one of my

636
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.440
favorite things uh to explore in fiction
and fantasy in uh both in science

637
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.240
fiction and fantasy is the relationship
between human nature and prophecy yeah

638
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.000
i'm just fascinated by that as a trope
like kind of a discussion about like the

639
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.520
to what extent things become
self-filling prophecies to what extent

640
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.680
does irony factor into the fulfillment
of these prophecies like with star wars

641
00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.200
um like anakin eventually anakin
balanced the force but that was after he

642
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.599
slaughtered the jedi to do it yeah um
like it was kind of a waiting games

643
00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:09.119
thing where he actually did balance it
because by the end there were two jedi

644
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.319
and two fifths the whole the thing i
love about star wars is mythology and

645
00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:16.240
don't give me a dime i will go off on
star wars is that the jedi

646
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.880
saw themselves as balance uh the jedi
were the balance uh so saying two jedi

647
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.440
versus two seth was imbalanced so the
jedi were the the the jedi were the

648
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.760
moderates yeah uh anakin and there were
no progressives exactly

649
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.240
um anakin balancing the force was
eradicating both the jedi and the sith

650
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.680
because they were both flawed systems
yeah and that's what i mean like to what

651
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.440
extent does prophecy interact with our
perception of how things are versus what

652
00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.280
things could be or what things really
are yeah uh um

653
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.800
and so like you know the prophecy of
anakin fulfilling the force came true

654
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.720
but in absolutely the worst way possible
for what the jedi could have possibly

655
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.920
expected yeah um and i i i love that
trope in fiction like we get on on

656
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.480
streams asked all the time what's her
favorite trope and fiction stuff that's

657
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.520
it yeah i i eat that up like and that
goes back to oedipus like it's it's just

658
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.280
such an interesting trope because like
it does kind of pull on both like the

659
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.040
fantasy wish fulfillment strings as well
as the you know you need to be very

660
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.400
intellectual to properly write a good
prophecy in fiction yeah um and luckily

661
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.560
there are a lot of authors who can pull
that off really marvelously yeah um

662
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.240
brain fart
[Laughter]

663
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.280
yeah like um my family
is less prophetic

664
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.720
and more talk to dead people kind of
thing

665
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.480
mine don't talk to dead people dead
people talk to them

666
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.680
my mom apparently
i'm not sure to what extent that i

667
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.359
believe that my mom is able to kind of
commu like um

668
00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:55.200
commune with people yeah
sometimes i remember my my mom's cousin

669
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.880
my
great aunt my aunt twice once removed i

670
00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.800
can't remember i don't know my mom's
cousin uh would just call up my mom

671
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.920
being like are you okay
yeah because it was like she had a bad

672
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.359
dream about mom and it was like i need
to call jody to make sure he's okay one

673
00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:14.560
time
i don't want to share too much um

674
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.280
my mom looked after a girl for a while
and this girl was in an abusive

675
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.760
relationship not horribly abusive
and mom you know really wanted to kind

676
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.880
of get her out of this but you know she
was like boundaries i need to sort of

677
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.319
respect this yeah
one day my mom wakes up and is like that

678
00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:36.319
girl needs me
and she drives to belleville which is

679
00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:40.000
two hours away from where we were drives
to belleville on a dime

680
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.520
uh this girl is sobbing like her life is
in shambles yeah it's been the last

681
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.200
straw with this guy
and she needs someone to move her into a

682
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.760
new place yeah like that day and she had
not talked to mom that day

683
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.520
um
my mom has sort of has this awareness of

684
00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.359
her kids sometimes like that yeah people
close to her like that's that's what i

685
00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:05.280
mean like i feel like i don't know if
that's like a personal awareness or if

686
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.680
i'm not unconvinced or i'm not convinced
that that's not

687
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.680
like psychic connections like that yeah
no not even a psychic connection but

688
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.760
like
a spirit or something like that and i

689
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.160
say spirit not a ghost like because like
a ghost is like in my mind a ghost is a

690
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.040
dead person but a spirit could be
anything yeah um a ball of energy yeah a

691
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.319
spirit kind of saying like
i saw this you need to go yeah um so is

692
00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:36.319
it is it a psychic frequency or is it a
spirit messenger a demon as plato would

693
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:42.640
say yeah and like in my mind i kind of
go towards spirit because forever

694
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.760
we have had we have talked about spirits
like

695
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.359
since the beginning of human society
specifically as messengers and that's

696
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:54.800
the spirits in most early mythologies
yeah and so i like i'm not unconvinced

697
00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:01.040
that you know that kind of thing
exists like there are so many stories of

698
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.800
people and i i like the ones who didn't
try and monetize it because i feel like

699
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.359
they're more legit but like the people
who woke up on the morning of 9 11 and

700
00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:14.720
said i shouldn't get on that plane today
and they were like i'm going to take a

701
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.839
later flight and then
911 happened

702
00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:21.040
or
you know people who

703
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.040
um

704
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:31.200
stuff like that uh
there there was one uh it was the

705
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.280
malaysia flight that just disappeared
yeah that there was uh a family was

706
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.280
supposed to get on did they eventually
find the wreckage i can't remember

707
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.480
but there was a family who was supposed
to get on that and the mom just had this

708
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.400
horrible feeling in the airport
um

709
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.040
and
she was like can we

710
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.559
can we get a different flight and and
the father was all stressed out because

711
00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:56.319
they had to call american express and
american express had like flight

712
00:47:56.319 --> 00:48:00.319
insurance blah blah blah like normally
people when they get a weird plane

713
00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:05.280
anyway but like to have a feeling that
viscerally repulsive to say i need to

714
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.359
change this plane ticket immediately
yeah like that that's quite an

715
00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:14.480
indication yeah uh that's that's really
interesting i'm i'm always invested in

716
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.079
that and and that's not just like a fear
of flying where it's like generally like

717
00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.599
oh god what if the plane goes down yeah
it's just like people who are fuel

718
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.960
people who are comfortable flying being
like there's something wrong this time

719
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.119
yeah um one thing that happened with me
when i was much younger uh and this is

720
00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:31.920
kind of related to the speaking to dead
people is mom does this very consciously

721
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.520
like she says that when she when people
who are close to her die she can feel

722
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.280
their energy passing
away like moving through this plane of

723
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.240
existence she says that she can feel
their final attitudes and kind of where

724
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.920
they're going and stuff
um she said she felt that way for her

725
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.720
many people but specifically her
great-grandmother who she was very close

726
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:54.000
to yeah um
and her now late husband who also um

727
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.440
passed away due to assisted suicide
um

728
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.440
oh and a great aunt that she knew that
was like my grandmother's best friend

729
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:07.839
um i i've yeah i get that because i
i have kind of been in that like when my

730
00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:11.200
grandmother died i wasn't in the room i
wasn't in but but you knew when it

731
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.480
happened i knew when it happened like
when my mom died like i was holding her

732
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.480
hand but i knew when it happened before
the doctor said

733
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.319
that it had happened i don't quite
experience that i never really have the

734
00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:25.920
closest i've ever come is it might be an
empath thing maybe but i've never

735
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.520
experienced it myself and i'm very like
kind of tuned to added moods that may or

736
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.000
may not exist
um

737
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.319
may or may not exist um
the only time i really ever had to

738
00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:40.800
commune with dead people was my
great-grandfather um who passed away

739
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.920
when i was two less than that
um i had a little play phone with like

740
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.280
the wheels and stuff and i was talking
to him on the phone yeah and normally

741
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.240
like mom would write it off and stuff
because like she does have a bit of

742
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.079
skepticism herself
but like she says that i was saying i

743
00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:58.720
was kind of relaying the message for
what he was saying and i was saying

744
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.079
things about him
that you shouldn't have known that i had

745
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:07.359
never learned yeah um or that i never
knew or i was never told i hear of stuff

746
00:50:07.359 --> 00:50:11.040
like that happening all the time
especially with kids i never know to

747
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.240
which maybe it's just a matter like
we're all testing out psychic powers and

748
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.960
we kind of reject the ones that don't
well that's what i was going to say that

749
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.280
it might be like
like as kids we're a lot less skeptical

750
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:25.040
of these things and skepticism weeds out
the things that we don't necessarily

751
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.559
like yeah but i've never
for me it's a matter of like okay

752
00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.160
because like for instance how many other
things that i say about recently dead

753
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.640
people like how many other times had i
talked about people that had been my

754
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.359
life that were gone that i sort of made
up stuff about them or kind of

755
00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:42.559
uh just sort of made assumptions about
them that ended up being incorrect and

756
00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.800
then grumps kind of brushed off he's
like oh of course he wouldn't know that

757
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.040
he's a kid yeah um like is it a matter
of response bias is a matter of sampling

758
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.040
bias like yeah uh and so that's why like
i want to believe these things but i'm a

759
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.119
little bit skeptic um you were saying
about kids and

760
00:50:57.119 --> 00:51:02.640
oh no i was gonna ask like say you were
out camping yeah and you saw a ufo yeah

761
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.760
and your phone was dead you couldn't
record it or anything how many people

762
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.200
would you tell
very few exactly

763
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:15.839
so and you know i think that applies to
you know ufos uh spirits angels like any

764
00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:19.119
kind of that kind of thing yeah that is
a bit of an embarrassment to talking

765
00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:22.800
about yeah like i've for some reason
never had an embarrassment telling

766
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.839
people
these things because i'm just like yeah

767
00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:30.160
if you don't like it [ __ ] off
uh i'm weird deal with it um

768
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.920
but like
i think so many people may have these

769
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.480
experiences these worldly paranormal
experiences and then just never say

770
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.400
anything because they're like i will be
ridiculed so i don't know if this

771
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.079
qualifies as spirituality but when i was
younger we lived in the country a lot

772
00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:49.280
yeah um like and you saw you've seen the
areas that i used to live in like it's

773
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.079
not like oh we lived on the edge of town
because we lived there too no i lived in

774
00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:56.559
like the sticks sometimes
i was never afraid of the woods

775
00:51:56.559 --> 00:52:00.000
um and in a way that my mom said that
made her unsaid unsettled her a little

776
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.240
bit i was never afraid to like just
venture out any time of day sometimes at

777
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.000
night and i never really went too far
but like just to go out and kind of just

778
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.119
walk around the trees um
[Music]

779
00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:14.240
i never got lost i
never

780
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.800
got stranded i went far sometimes but i
always you know knew how to find my way

781
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.480
back yeah i've always been a bit of a
pathfinder that way

782
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.079
um
i i never had a fear of the woods the

783
00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:28.559
way that my mom did or the way that
other people do

784
00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:32.079
um and you've seen me and you've seen me
when i get into nature i turn into ghost

785
00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:35.760
fast uh
yeah i leave the trail you see me again

786
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.880
sometimes
like i was that way as a kid like my

787
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.839
best friend um
and i actually when i was uh younger

788
00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:50.240
like younger than five um
we both lived next to rather large

789
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.559
sections of woods
um in very rural

790
00:52:54.559 --> 00:52:56.880
areas
um

791
00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.880
and
the two of us were but like

792
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.520
fine going out into the woods all by
ourselves at night like any time of year

793
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.760
and like and like our parents would be
like where the hell were you like we

794
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.359
were in the woods and like we had no
fear of that but here here's the thing

795
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:17.040
like when it comes to going into the
woods see like the park nearby i would

796
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.400
never go to that tonight because i i
can't imagine what goes on there after

797
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.079
dark oh i would never go into the woods
alone at night now um i would never go

798
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:28.559
into the woods alone at night in an
urban center um so that would include

799
00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:31.760
like parks like uh central park that
includes um

800
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.880
like where we shop
yeah stranger things where we shot the

801
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.359
stranger things video like i was like we
need to leave james i don't like being

802
00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:41.599
here um if it's any place where people
have access to i won't go there at night

803
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:44.640
when did you say we had to leave for the
stranger things thing well not the

804
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.200
stranger things video um i i was kind of
suspicious of the person driving around

805
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.880
yeah uh and that's the thing i'm
suspicious of people not things that

806
00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.079
exist in the woods yeah because
generally speaking those things will

807
00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:58.960
avoid you like the plague like that the
place that i'm talking about that i

808
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.119
lived in the sticks like there were
these really weird chirping noises like

809
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:07.839
squawky chirpy noises yeah um and there
were also wild turkeys living around so

810
00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:11.280
i was i was like they're just wild
turkeys whatever it's no big deal

811
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.720
um see there were coyotes where i was
and i lost several cats to coyotes uh

812
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.000
and that before
but before we decided okay the cats are

813
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.319
indoors now um but
like i was never afraid of the coyotes i

814
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:30.240
and like you could hear them at night
yipping yeah the thing is those chirping

815
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.920
noises we learned in montreal the
biodome one day that those were not

816
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.400
turkeys
those were in fact bobcats

817
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.559
yeah wild bobcats yeah and after
learning more about turkey noises after

818
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:45.760
learning about like wild turkey honestly
i'd rather take the bobcats than the

819
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.520
turkeys like oh yeah a bob's cat won't
attack you or turkey well amount of

820
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.480
things in the woods and this changes
depending on the region of course but in

821
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.040
central ontario this is very true there
everything in the woods

822
00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.160
is going to avoid you like the plague
even bears it does not want to [ __ ] with

823
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.119
human beings because even if it does
kill one human being i think there's an

824
00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:08.480
awareness especially in wolves because
they're intelligent there's an awareness

825
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:13.520
that if we kill this thing others will
come for us yeah um because that's what

826
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:17.680
happens in nature yeah
like if a wolf kills a cougar they

827
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.920
recognize that we are pack animals yeah
because when they see us together and we

828
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.640
don't see them when they're looking
observing us because they do observe us

829
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.880
yeah like any time you're in nature
there are animals watching you yeah um

830
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.680
they're watching you masturbate um
if you're doing that in nature

831
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.440
what's nature what else is nature for
maybe you're just out enjoying a nice

832
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.119
walk
meanwhile the weirdo in the woods is

833
00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:44.240
jerking off watching you

834
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.359
oh the kind of ones i like going into
don't have trails that's the thing so

835
00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:53.680
um but yeah that's kind of like a really
creepy feeling

836
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.960
like
in when you're walking in the woods like

837
00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.119
there are things in there that are
watching you they may be predator or

838
00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:05.920
prey like it could be yeah and the only
place that this is really different is

839
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:11.200
places in canada with very dense forests
um that struggle to kind of produce

840
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.359
small life like rabbits or something
that uh packs of wolves can eat um the

841
00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:18.079
west coast
uh has lots of mountain lions and

842
00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:21.040
grizzly bears and grizzly bears won't
hunt you but they will attack you if you

843
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.799
go into their territory if you're or if
you get near their cub uh and mountain

844
00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:28.640
lions are more so just completely
territorial but even then they will

845
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.799
prefer to push you out of territory
rather than yeah they'll growl yeah

846
00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:36.720
they will i don't know if anyone saw
that video of that guy recording the

847
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.640
mountain lion that was kind of
walking down a path with him

848
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.400
um and someone pointed out in the
comments that like no this this thing

849
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.520
wasn't about to attack that guy this
thing was

850
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.440
pushing him out of her territory because
if she wanted to hunt him he would not

851
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.760
have had the time to get his phone out
yeah um and that's there was probably a

852
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.760
baby somewhere nearby
at like a baby cougar or

853
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.319
you said cougar right yeah it was a
cougar mountain lion those are the same

854
00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:06.880
thing i think um so you know their their
kitten yeah uh was nearby and they were

855
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.839
like no no i'm getting rid of you
um you smell weird yeah like that kind

856
00:57:11.839 --> 00:57:14.799
of thing because there is a danger when
it comes to human beings because because

857
00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:18.240
we are large and even though we don't
have claws or anything i think and a lot

858
00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.799
of animals recognize us of having very
strange tools and weapons at our

859
00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:27.599
disposal and they don't like aliens yeah
exactly and they don't really complete

860
00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:30.480
and these animals don't really
completely comprehend what's going on so

861
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.319
they would rather remove us from our
territory or ignore us if possible

862
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:41.440
rather than directly confront us yeah
and i think that's like that's one of

863
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.599
kind of brings it back to the the
paranormal supernatural is that

864
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:50.319
there are things in nature that we think
we you know nature like the woods that

865
00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:54.160
we feel like we have a really good grasp
on that we really don't like the

866
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.280
behaviors of animals and how sometimes
animals that i get very upset when

867
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.559
people say that animals don't think
rationally because i'm like okay what is

868
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:06.000
reason yeah what is reason in that kind
because like when you want to get into

869
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.520
reason it's just an incredibly because
in philosophy there it's it's a

870
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.440
dichotomy of reason versus emotion and i
i wholeheartedly have always rejected

871
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.599
that in philosophy and i think that's
the main reason why i didn't get

872
00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:18.559
invested in philosophy because i don't
necessarily believe there is a

873
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:23.200
difference between reason and
rationality because our reason and

874
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.079
emotion because it seems to me that you
know like

875
00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:29.760
the the mindset is that oh
uh animals are guided by our emotions

876
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.000
because when they're hungry they just
eat and like how are humans any

877
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.839
different uh we just consume different
foods and we rationalize different foods

878
00:58:35.839 --> 00:58:41.040
to kind of fulfill those needs
um animals are capable of reasoning pack

879
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:46.400
uh pack mentality um hunting practices
bees can interpret can can send messages

880
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.680
about the locations of flowers based on
interpretive dancing yeah bats have a

881
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.079
form of uh
um

882
00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:56.799
communal currency where they use
regurgitated blood and the pack and the

883
00:58:56.799 --> 00:59:01.200
the bunch this colony of bats keeps
track of which bats are selfish versus

884
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.480
which bats are more giving they'll make
friends with the giving bats but reject

885
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:10.079
but isolate the the selfish ones yeah um
so like the animal kingdom has all of

886
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:13.359
these things that we have typified as
being human behavior

887
00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:16.880
but at the same time like i i can't
really say that the ability ability to

888
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.720
do math isn't in itself an emotion
because what do you get out of doing

889
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.960
that math equation yeah there is an
emotional payback from doing that

890
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.119
whether it's something you do
begrudgingly or something you do because

891
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:31.599
you want to be teacher's pet like
you know like there is a we we don't

892
00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:35.200
rationalize for the sake of rational
rationalization we do it for the sake of

893
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.079
an emotional gain whether it is a
kickback or whether it is a career yeah

894
00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:43.359
and like i
excuse me i don't know i don't know how

895
00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:48.160
we got into nature stuff
nature's part is like nature is one of

896
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.200
the
two areas where the ancients believed

897
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.119
that magic existed whether it was in the
ocean or it came in the woods that's why

898
00:59:55.119 --> 01:00:01.119
uh hecate uh the greek god of magic um
is a god of forests and

899
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:05.359
night pathways yeah uh through the
forest and she she very much is a

900
01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:09.520
wilderness god and gods associated with
the woods and associated with wilderness

901
01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.359
are typically gods associated with magic
also yeah um

902
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:16.240
and and that's kind of
closer to what i believe in the

903
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.880
spiritual sense about magic is that it's
a

904
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.880
an element of the world or a connection
within the world that kind of connects

905
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.680
it to itself yeah that there's this kind
of energy my vibrations to use my

906
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.880
grandmother's term like yeah and at the
same time and like

907
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.680
like people could say like oh you feel
like there's an energy around you

908
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.000
and like you're you're a
you know hippie weirdo but at the same

909
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.599
time
cern

910
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:49.920
is bit by bit proving that there is
unseen energy around us at the same time

911
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.200
these people wanted that's influencing
yes the dark matter is literally

912
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.680
influencing us
and we still don't know what it is but

913
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.799
we know that it has an effect and we're
investigating that in fact and pooh

914
01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:02.240
hooing it isn't gonna you know make it
not real yeah just saying but again you

915
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.720
know it's a it's an energy instead of
dark matter it's kind of a nerd effect

916
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.119
where you know like the football jocks
will you know insult nerds for like kind

917
01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:15.200
of paying homage via cosplay at the same
time okay so you go out to look at

918
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.440
football matches or soccer matches and
you get painted up in your colors and

919
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.040
you get the jersey and you get the hats
and it's like

920
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.280
every time you're watching a football
game at home in a jersey you're

921
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.880
cosplaying yeah and not just that you're
the sense of like i'm here showing

922
01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.720
support for my team through my
television set showing support

923
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.160
hypothetically does not affect the
effect does not affect the gameplay

924
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:42.480
performance of the players no that in
itself is a superstition uh the the

925
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.000
concept of so many people play offbeard
it's another thing like i can't shave my

926
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.520
playoff beard or else it'll make bad
luck for my team it's like that how is

927
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.520
that not witchcraft that in itself is a
is a ritual you're waiting to to commit

928
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.960
a kind of magic and these are people who
would say witches don't exist but at the

929
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.000
same time
say that they have to you know if

930
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.839
they're watching the super bowl they can
only drink half a can of beer and like

931
01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:07.680
or really is that a thing oh so i i'm
just making something up but like but

932
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.240
like like there are rituals according to
weird superstitions and rituals um

933
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.680
in which case
my team won't win if i don't do x x and

934
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.880
x the more you talk about this more i'm
like you need to play the game control

935
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.039
it's so good and it ties into all of
these things and it's fantastic

936
01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:28.720
but yeah so i guess in closing
aliens are real

937
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.920
magic may or may not exist and if it
exists it likely does not exist in a way

938
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.400
that we are capable of comprehending
yeah i understand it's not coming

939
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.599
through wands but it
it's something

940
01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:39.920
and

941
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:43.200
[Laughter]
and

942
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.640
the uh
alien there is no alien in area 54

943
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.039
because honestly the alien is a cover-up
for weapons development because that's

944
01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:58.799
what's going on there if if the us
actually had a secret that they kept for

945
01:02:58.799 --> 01:03:02.559
70 years
they only managed to keep the nuclear

946
01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:07.119
bomb a secret how to make a nuclear bomb
for less than a decade

947
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:10.720
do you think they couldn't keep that
secret but they could keep a gray secret

948
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.640
and honestly like the fact that you know
like oh there are no aliens in 50 area

949
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.880
51 it's like okay well the american
government has been very sloppy on that

950
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.079
the aliens are a helpful cover-up for
actually covering up whatever weapons

951
01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:26.319
they're developing there
it's not though no no because like if

952
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:30.400
there was anything really useful going
on at area 51

953
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.079
the worst thing to do would to say no
there's no aliens here

954
01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:39.920
because everyone's like
you're lying and then they want to find

955
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.559
out about the aliens and then it's like
okay what else is in area i'm sad that

956
01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:49.440
the raid on area 51 that happened in
like 2016 i'm sad that that wasn't like

957
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.839
a yearly ritual that people didn't show
up to area 51 like on i think it was

958
01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:57.839
september
9th i can't remember the date i can't

959
01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:01.119
remember um but you know like i i was
really

960
01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:05.520
i was i was following that very closely
leading up to it and then i was

961
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.119
really excited that people actually
showed up and there were food trucks and

962
01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:12.160
like people seemed to be having a fun
time when there was one person reporting

963
01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.920
on it and someone in the background was
just doing a random naruto naruto run

964
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.079
yeah

965
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.480
i i i'm sad that that didn't keep
happening because it sounded like that

966
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.079
that could have been a fun ritual but
see it was dumb because they let

967
01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:29.520
everyone know okay show up at area 51 on
this day

968
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.640
if there were things to hide you gave
them a chance to hide them yeah i think

969
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.839
it was less about having the chance to
hide them and more about developing like

970
01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:40.240
it was like whenever
in 2020 when everyone joined um ant's

971
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.240
foot ants groups on facebook to just be
pretend to be aunt pretend to be ants

972
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.000
with all caps
like i did not do that i did it was a

973
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.119
fun time and still people until people
started saying that typing in all caps

974
01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:55.039
was ableist and i was like okay the
joke's not funny anymore

975
01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:57.359
all right i figured that's a good way to
end

976
01:04:57.359 --> 01:05:00.079
or
we need to end it there on a healthy

977
01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:03.280
dose of ableism yeah
uh

978
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.559
on a
yeah skepticism right there um so yeah

979
01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:12.880
thank you for listening to episode 13 of

981
01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:21.200

unsettling my aunt getting you know

982
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.079

glass of water and

986

when
everyone woke up the next morning there

987
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.039
was her glass of water on the table and
a half finished glass of water on the

988
01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:49.920
table so it's like it's creepy
and you know not a real explanation of

989
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.640
it she might have been high and had two
glasses of water

990
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.319
