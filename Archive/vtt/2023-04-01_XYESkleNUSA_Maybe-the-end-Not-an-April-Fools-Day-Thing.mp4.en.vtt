00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.080
hey everyone
um

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.440
I just want to preface this
is not an April Fool's Day video

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.559
um
bad timing

4
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.100
but it's not an April Fool's Day video
we just got

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.920
um our lowest
patreon payout in

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.720
well over a year and by a lot
um

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.260
like less than half
of uh

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.079
of what of what we usually get a month
this uh kind of

9
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.680
coinciding with

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.340
the YouTube video is doing
not great in general a year ago

11
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.920
um most videos we're doing about 300 000
views

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760
um now we're very lucky if we can get to
200

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
000 usually they're not even Crossing
there YouTube has started

14
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.740
uh hitting a lot some of our videos with
18 plus

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.100
ratings which basically kill the video
dead there's

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.299
it's just it's just dead and there's you
know

17
00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.180
always the uh
the pain in the butt of uh people not

18
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.380
getting notified when videos come out
and stuff like that which is

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.979
we've kind of gotten used to that but
there was always uh the patreon as this

20
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.040
sort of
not backup but this this uh bedrock

21
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.579
that we had where we knew that even if
YouTube was you know

22
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.340
being a dick uh
our patrons were still there

23
00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.119
and it
now it looks like maybe not

24
00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.360
um this
month we got less than half of our worst

25
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.619
month
in the past year

26
00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.720
um
it was or no mid-2021

27
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.160
since we've seen numbers this low
um

28
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.000
and because YouTube is you know not
sending the videos out and our views are

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.780
way down we're not getting a whole lot
of AD Revenue

30
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.420
um and now with this huge drop in uh in
patreon numbers

31
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.840
uh Patron income the the patron numbers
seem to be the same as usual but the the

32
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.360
income is way down so I'm assuming a lot
of patrons have had to uh reduce their

33
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560
pledges
um for you know financial reasons that's

34
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.080
completely understandable
but uh

35
00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.720
with with the amount that came in this
month

36
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.780
um

37
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.620
I don't know if we'll be able to
continue with the channel

38
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.760
um
there's just not enough

39
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.159
there to pay bills and for uh for Nick
and I

40
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.940
especially living you know we live we
don't live together now we live apart

41
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.560
and so
um we're not roommates anymore and so

42
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.120
it uh
and and Nick is you know if you don't

43
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.599
know Nick is uh a writer and
co-producer on on the videos

44
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.360
and uh
if if the patreon numbers

45
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.099
um
stay like that then it's we can't really

46
00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.060
I don't think we can keep going which
really sucks

47
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.760
um we had a bunch of plans
um well we had a bunch of plans

48
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.500
specifically for patrons there's a video
coming out

49
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.959
uh supposed to come out later
uh was supposed to come out next weekend

50
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.380
um
and uh there's gonna be a a whole other

51
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.660
version of it just for patrons doing
more things like watchalongs where we

52
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.940
get to interact with the patrons and
watch movies and stuff like that we've

53
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.340
been trying to do more stuff like that
kind of make it worth being a patron

54
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.020
um but like video wise we have a bunch
of stuff

55
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.180
planned
um

56
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.240
but I don't know if um
if that's going to be possible

57
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.180
um
I've really really enjoyed this last

58
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.360
year
where uh we we really had a really solid

59
00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.139
bedrock with patrons
um I'm not sure if we've done something

60
00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.280
what it might be
um but uh

61
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.880
with YouTube being the way it is and if
patrons

62
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.520
if the patreon stays this low I don't
think um

63
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.720
I don't think the channel will be long
for this world

64
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.139
um as it sounds so dramatic
um but yeah we're we won't be able to

65
00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.639
focus on videos we won't be able to do
videos anymore I've loved doing this so

66
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.419
much this is

67
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.539
when things got really if you follow me
on Twitter and stuff like that you know

68
00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.699
things got really really dark for me in
December and uh

69
00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.259
it was being you know
being able to make videos that that kind

70
00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.740
of drew me back out of that
and so I'm really gonna miss that so I

71
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.500
hope
I'm sorry I hope that uh

72
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.440
maybe something works out but if things
stay the way they are

73
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560
um so I just wanted to put this out
there

74
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.320
uh
just so that you know in case the

75
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.520
channel goes quiet
that so that you you know why

76
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.460
um
hopefully something works out and we can

77
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.660
keep doing this
because I love making these videos I

78
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.039
love making
especially the educational videos the

79
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.380
historical videos I love making the
video essays where you know we get to

80
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.860
talk about smart stuff and I can
go all crazy with cinematography and

81
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.300
sets and lighting and stuff like that
and it just it's

82
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.539
like I I know it's
it's so corny and stupid but I got I

83
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.860
love my job
and

84
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.419
it really suck
it would really suck

85
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:10.380
if uh if I couldn't do this anymore
but I hope hopefully something works out

86
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.520
but um

87
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.780
yeah I I just it was like a
kicking the teeth

88
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.460
seeing seeing those numbers because
that's

89
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.400
that's not even being able to being able
for Nick and I to pay our rent

90
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.539
um
so we're gonna we're in a bad spot

91
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.280
but um
uh for everyone who is a patron and has

92
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.660
