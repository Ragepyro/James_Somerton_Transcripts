00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.480
the bulk of content on this channel is
about queer representation and because

5
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.400
as i have mentioned numerous times the
walt disney corporation is playing a

6
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.360
ruthless cutthroat game of being the
world's number one producer of media in

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.000
general
my ire is naturally drawn to

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.039
that believe it or not i'd really like
to not talk about disney so often i'd

9
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.879
love to make more videos about
representation that doesn't suck i would

10
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.440
like to be able to celebrate what we
could have and do have

11
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.160
instead i spend most of the time
explaining how it's okay to ask for more

12
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.879
than the flaky lean in queerness that
we've all been gaslid into praising but

13
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.119
the problem with a dwindling number of
large studios capable of juggling the

14
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.200
kind of budgets you need for multimedia
productions is that there are too few

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.920
cooks in the kitchen
fewer cooks mean the menu gets slashed

16
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.479
and we don't have anyone else to go to
if we don't like what we're being served

17
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.680
so we end up groveling at the feet of
these studio executives and believe them

18
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.360
when they say they're doing the best
that they can and then putting them on

19
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
these pedestals when they roll out the
bare minimum if we weren't living in

20
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.280
such a monopolistic world we wouldn't
have to talk about disney we could just

21
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.280
let the free market do its thing and
give other studios a chance to corner

22
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
the market on all ages queer content
queer inclusive blockbusters queer

23
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.840
characters and genre films or even
lighthearted adult-oriented queer

24
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.720
content that isn't about a
reductionalist display of pathos and

25
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.119
suffering as the sole defining element
of queer validity but in spite of

26
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.840
disney's obsession with cow towing to
its own brand like that's the anthill

27
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.319
that it's going to die on there are a
few times they have given the gays

28
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.840
everything they want and while i was
making content about disney's

29
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.720
shortcomings on representation i was
informed that the owl house the 2020

30
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.800
animated series on the disney channel
absolved disney of all the queerbaiting

31
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.720
queer phobia that i was accusing them of
and even when i wasn't talking about

32
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.480
disney at all i was reminded of the owl
house over

33
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.000
and over and over and over and so i
watched it

34
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.160
go me i guess i really wasn't ever
expecting to hate it

35
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.760
i just wasn't watching it because
i'm an only child which means when

36
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
someone tells me to do something i don't
do it just because i don't like being

37
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.160
told what to do i was probably going to
end up watching it in the end eventually

38
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.840
probably would have waited for a third
season so i could properly binge it but

39
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.760
disney decided to be a big old dick and
soft cancel the show by cutting the

40
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.280
final season down from the 19 to 21
episodes

41
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.080
to three
and this cancellation came in spite of

42
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.000
the show's growing fan base and
increasing word of mouth popularity the

43
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.640
only reason i know about the existence
of the owl house is due entirely to

44
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.840
people talking about it not a single
disney

45
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.720
ad and there isn't much that manages to
slip past me on social media these days

46
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.720
so disney managed to produce media which
was openly queer kid-friendly adult

47
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.400
accessible and which the gays didn't
really have a problem with

48
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.640
and didn't really stir up much of a
controversy from queer opposition which

49
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.280
seems to be exactly the kind of kickback
they're hoping to accomplish every time

50
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.440
they throw a variable lesbian into a
pixar movie or a sassy gay-coded

51
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.840
sidekick into a live-action remake and
every time they try that

52
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.080
they basically project headlines to the
moon to let everyone know about it and

53
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.920
every time we come away feeling unseen
and every time they promised next time

54
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.640
is when they're actually going to give
us the real first queer character all

55
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.879
the while leaks out of pixar indicate
that all that queer coding we've been

56
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.560
reading into
we're actually once intended to be a

57
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.840
part of the picture and yet the mouse
left it on the cutting room floor yet

58
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.320
when they got exactly what they seemed
to be looking for with the owl house

59
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
they tore it down
so time to conduct a psychological

60
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.000
assessment on a corporation to
attempt

61
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.930
to figure out
what could possibly be going on in there

62
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.800
[Music]
the owl house was approved for a second

63
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.800
season in 2019 before it even premiered
this kind of two-season safety net no

64
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960
doubt helped contribute to the writer's
confidence in brazenly depicting queer

65
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
identities and media directed toward a
juvenile audience and even though season

66
00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.000
one only really served up some gay dads
background gay prom dates and strong

67
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.800
overtones of lesbian panic that must
have been a bit too queer for disney i

68
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.919
say only because it really is the least
a piece of media can do to represent us

69
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.120
but it still leaks above what most media
offers should we be grateful for getting

70
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.680
offered a sip of water after a week in
the desert hmm so what's going on in the

71
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.080
owl house well the titular residence
itself is a sentient building which is

72
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.800
or is not
controlled by hoodie

73
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.520
who is a sentient door doorbell doorman
door knocker security system and best

74
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.800
friend the primary resident eda is an
incredibly powerful witch swindler an

75
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.039
all-around miscreant who is wanted by
the law because she refuses to conform

76
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.960
to an arbitrary standard of rules and
guidelines she lives with a strange

77
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.000
adorable dog demon first named king last
name of demons he may be a pet or a

78
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.639
roommate or an adopted child ida makes
her living off the grid by using an

79
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.960
interdimensional portal to snag garbage
from the human world to pawn off to

80
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.199
magical residents of the boiling isles
as novelties and one day a piece of

81
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.240
garbage named luz wanders through lose
is a people not garbage that that was a

82
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.080
joke people aren't garbage most people
aren't garbage lose is a girl who has

83
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.560
her head if it's not in the clouds it's
somewhere else she's a little bit not

84
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.479
like the other girls to the point where
her mother decides she needs to be

85
00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.680
shipped off to a special secluded summer
camp that will teach her how to be

86
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.560
normal it's not analogous for a certain
kind of therapy camp at all i swear

87
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.039
instead she chases ita's staff owl
through a briefcase portal into the

88
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.560
boiling isles a magical place horrible
place creator dana terrace's direct

89
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.280
inspiration was narnia imagined by
herronius bach the whole of the isles

90
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.520
are the corpse of a long dead titan
because the titan was magical all life

91
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.960
evolved on the islands to use this magic
and it's mostly unpleasant

92
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.199
yeah we don't have weather we have
plagues luz decides she would rather

93
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.759
stay here and learn to be a witch from
eda instead of going back home where she

94
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.319
would have to be in a summer camp where
she'd be shoved into a neatly labeled

95
00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:14.960
box which would deterministically
establish how she can contribute to

96
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.479
normal society
and if lose is going to get labeled

97
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:22.800
she's going to put that label on herself
damn it humans do not typically live on

98
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.759
the boiling isles however though the
residents know of humans and though the

99
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:33.039
sum of human monsters and myths come
from the boiling isles there is quite a

100
00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:38.960
hubbub about a human living there did
you know that humans now barbed wire to

101
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.479
their kids teeth but why
maybe to make them magnetic

102
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:49.520
all things on the boiling isles can use
magic to an extent but as humans have

103
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.000
not evolved here they lack the
physiological organs needed to use it

104
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.039
luz however manages to figure out a way
to make magic out of glyphs and joins a

105
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:04.160
magic school much to the dismay of eda
who loathes conformity there are some

106
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.960
very clear parallels between eda and luz
and the boiling isles can be seen as a

107
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.560
microcosm of our social culture of
conformity all witches by mandate must

108
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.879
join a coven and when they join a coven
they are branded and their access to

109
00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:24.160
magic is limited to only the single type
of magic the coven represents ita

110
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.479
refuses to limit her potential priding
herself on being the strongest witch on

111
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:32.959
the isles and she looks down on the
witches who conformed to these covens

112
00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.440
they ida claims are choosing to limit
their own potential for the sole purpose

113
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.919
of keeping up social conventions chaotic
pansexual energy for the win and there

114
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.640
are punishments social and legislative
for non-conformity especially for those

115
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.080
who refuse to relegate themselves only
one label of identity i mean magic the

116
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.480
real plot of the series revolves around
the topic of expression and identity the

117
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.200
primary villain of the series enforces
this coven hegemony strictly and with an

118
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.320
iron fist emperor bellows the only coven
which is permitted to practice all forms

119
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.560
of magic is the emperor's coven
where he recruits witches whose

120
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.160
unbridled talent he needs to enforce his
will but who he can still control with

121
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.480
promises of his favor eda represents the
most dangerous threat to his

122
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.160
totalitarian rule an exceptional witch
who does not need him to be as powerful

123
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.440
as she is non-conformity is tolerable to
authority when insignificant

124
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.440
but those who are exceptional can
challenge authoritarian rhetoric while

125
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.320
emperor belos's plots and centuries-old
schemes are the underlying narrative of

126
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.080
the show the bulk of each episode
features lew's going on magical

127
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.399
coming-of-age adventures frequently
featuring her friends willow and gus and

128
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:53.839
then later amity who was once a rival
and later a girlfriend with an actual

129
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:58.399
animated gay kiss
towards the end of the second season yes

130
00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:02.640
but there is a great deal of
hand-holding and cheek smooching leading

131
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.720
up to that true to form these girls who
like girls spend a great deal of time

132
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.480
doubting whether the girl who is
displaying obvious signs of affection

133
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.720
actually likes them and after they
started dating both luz and amity

134
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.399
vocalized the word girlfriend
about

135
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:24.000
once each episode which while gratuitous
is a great way to remind the audience

136
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.560
that they are in fact girlfriends
because in spite of the blushing the

137
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.120
dancing the hand-holding the gay panic
there was a contingent of the audience

138
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.279
that still felt that the pairing
came out of nowhere and even though the

139
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.760
show chooses to depict queerness
textually it also goes out of its way to

140
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.480
continue including subtextual queerness
too to me this is clear in the character

141
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.600
designs themselves look closely and you
may spot a number of lgbtq flags in the

142
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.399
show not being flown from flagpoles or
hung up in the windows however lose's

143
00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:01.440
primary design seems to sample colors
from the asexual flag which alternately

144
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.519
may be sampling from the demisexual
colors however with the addition of her

145
00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:10.560
cloak she wears bisexual colors eda's
sister lilith vaguely resembles the

146
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.519
asexual flag at least in season one
however she was also described as arrow

147
00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:19.519
ace by people working on the show
looking at king i always felt that his

148
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:24.480
eye colors were a weird choice there
could have been lots of ways to make his

149
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.959
eyes pop but this seemed weirdly
specific if we're following this pattern

150
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:33.760
of flag colors though his eyes
themselves resemble the intersex flag or

151
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.920
his color scheme as a whole matches the
non-binary flag and furthermore amity's

152
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.160
hair color change bears a resemblance to
the genderqueer flag this may be a bit

153
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.320
of a stretch given that there is a they
them character on the show eat his ex

154
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.800
reign whom all characters automatically
default to their chosen pronouns the

155
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.120
flag colors are likely nothing more than
a nod that contributes to the overlying

156
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040
queerness of the show as a whole maybe
on a dare someone told dana that they

157
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.639
can't possibly use the queer flags as a
color palette for an entire animated

158
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.560
series because even if they aren't
strictly written as queer the show does

159
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.519
tend to lean on queer flags for palettes
for instance eda's color palette seems

160
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:15.360
to be sampled from the lesbian flag
she's not a lesbian herself she

161
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.680
references a train of ex-boyfriends but
i bet if you asked her how she

162
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.000
identified she'd just say i'm eda the
owl lady the most powerful witch on the

163
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.880
boiling aisles i mean she does kind of
have these rogue queer aunt vibes right

164
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.279
the kind who's late to family functions
who's the subject of family gossip who

165
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:39.279
somehow always manages to land on her
feet and who hides things in her hair

166
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:42.959
the kind who you feel safe asking if she
can hook you up with a fake id and will

167
00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:48.000
not only deliver but take you to your
first bar some of us are lucky enough to

168
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.440
know her so yes the owl house is very
unafraid to brazenly depict queerness

169
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.040
while at the same time
leaning on queer coding and unspoken

170
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.440
queerness to indicate that the boiling
isles are much more lenient when it

171
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.600
comes to sexual and gender identities
this is a world after all where people

172
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.959
belong to various categories of demons
some of whom do not appear to have any

173
00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:15.200
gender traits in a world where there are
sentient tentacle monsters chest-faced

174
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.279
centaurs and tenelonoza it would make
sense that getting upset about pronouns

175
00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:23.120
wouldn't have a place in common
discourse however what helps the owl

176
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.120
house rise above being just a cartoon
about queer people is that it also

177
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.680
offers additional commentary about a
queer state of affairs how luz escapes

178
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.480
from one system of oppression and learns
that this world of magical freedom has a

179
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.639
system of oppression all its own and for
this the owl house takes an increasingly

180
00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:46.079
anti-establishment stance
which is not directed at singular jerks

181
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:51.680
but rather discusses root causes of
societal oppression as a whole but is

182
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.639
this anti-establishment sentiment why
disney a massive corporation with weird

183
00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:01.600
internal rules and cultural standards
canceled the show

184
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.880
likely not
because just be yourself has been the

185
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.959
media mantra of disney since the
renaissance in the 90s so if the owl

186
00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:13.760
house has broad strokes messaging that
matches the disney brand and if it has

187
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.279
animation and design that matches the
disney brand and if it has an array of

188
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:23.519
characters and presented themes about
family values that match the disney

189
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:29.680
brand and if aside from that the show
boasts stellar ratings and prestige

190
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.920
which very much cements the disney brand
as presenting excellence in children's

191
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:42.360
media then why on earth did they cancel
it who knows why who could ever know

192
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.760
we know
[Music]

193
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.160
generally disney channel animated shows
tend to run for fewer seasons when

194
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.920
compared to their network counterparts
look at adventure time and steven

195
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.519
universe which clocked in at 283 and 160
episodes respectively and compare them

196
00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:08.560
to popular disney channel shows like
gravity falls 41 episodes and star vs

197
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.839
the forces of evil 77 episodes once upon
a time disney even had the 65 episode

198
00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:18.240
rule where no animated show on the
disney channel could go past 65 episodes

199
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.079
it's an outdated business practice that
disney clung onto a lot longer than most

200
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:27.839
producers with 65 episodes one episode
could be broadcast each weekday reaching

201
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:33.759
the 65th episode at the end of the 13th
week 13 weeks is one quarter of a year

202
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:38.959
four 65 episode shows can be broadcast
in a single calendar year in the same

203
00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:43.440
time slot it took shows like gargoyles
and ducktales to end that trend but that

204
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.480
doesn't mean disney doesn't use bullcrap
reasons to cancel shows today terrace

205
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.199
previously offered some insight into why
the owl house wasn't renewed for a full

206
00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:57.920
third season which boiled down to a
frustratingly simple reason

207
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.680
that had nothing to do with reviews all
good or viewership also good someone

208
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.040
decided
that the show didn't fit

209
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.399
disney's brand
they just wanted to be done with the owl

210
00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.920
house and this was the perfect chance to
do that

211
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.399
even getting the consolation season 3
episodes was difficult apparently

212
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:22.720
hard to say i wasn't allowed to be part
of any conversation until i was just

213
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.720
told at the end of the day there are a
few business people who oversee what

214
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.560
fits into the disney brand and one day
one of those guides decided the owl

215
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.160
house just didn't fit that brand the
story is serialized barely compared to

216
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.720
any average anime lmao our audience
skews older and that just didn't fit

217
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.680
this one guy's tastes that's it ain't
that wild really grinds my guts boils my

218
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.560
brains kicks my shins and all the things
it sucks but it is what it is while we

219
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.839
have had issues airing in a few
countries and are just straight up

220
00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:57.920
banned and a few more i'm not gonna
assume bad faith against the people i

221
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.839
work with in l.a don't worry dana
i'll assume the bad faith for you so it

222
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:09.199
was one guy's taste one guy
one guy who could be that one guy who

223
00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:13.839
could that one guy be though not
officially confirmed i'm willing to bet

224
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:18.640
it's
this guy bob chapic the current ceo of

225
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.880
the walt disney company who earlier this
year made a name for himself by not

226
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.959
speaking out about florida's don't say
gay bill until it was too late to do

227
00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:30.559
anything about it
and was infamously forcing disney and

228
00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:35.360
pixar filmmakers to cut queer content
from their films chabick made his name

229
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.120
in the company by running the disney
parks many feel he ran them into the

230
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.559
ground disenchantment with the parks
from die hard disney lovers has been

231
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:49.280
at an all-time high ever since he got
control of the parks let alone the

232
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760
company massive price increases in
everything from food to ticket prices to

233
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.440
accommodations have made a disney
vacation more difficult to afford than

234
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.919
ever to the point where a suite at the
disneyland hotel

235
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:07.440
costs more than staying at the palace of
versailles in france at the same time

236
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.200
the company has eliminated perks like
the formerly free magical express

237
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.120
transportation to and from walt disney
world from the orlando airport genie

238
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.240
plus has made standby lines regularly
exceed an hour for rides that used to

239
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.039
average 15 minutes even bob iger the
former disney ceo and the man who

240
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:30.240
hand-picked jay pick has had regrets
several disney sources and people who

241
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.559
are familiar with iger's thinking have
indicated that iger has spent the time

242
00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:39.679
since announcing chapic as his successor
regretting what he has called one of his

243
00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:44.240
worst business decisions according to a
former disney executive iger has said

244
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.720
that he didn't realize chapick was such
a novice when it came to handling

245
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.200
complex issues like talent management
and political battles and that chapic

246
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.880
was arrogant and uninterested in other
people's opinions he's also not fond of

247
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.880
the fact that chapic is a crypto
enthusiast who wants nfts to become

248
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.799
particularly important parts of disney
going forward he's even started

249
00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:10.880
consulting with warner brothers on how
to rebuild the dc eu

250
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.760
that's how much he wants chapic to fail
chapic has also come under harsh

251
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.240
criticism for treatment of cast members
that's what disney calls park employees

252
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.160
many full-time park employees struggle
to provide food and basic necessities

253
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.000
for their families earlier this year
abigail disney grand niece of walt

254
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.840
disney and granddaughter of company
co-founder roy disney released a

255
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.440
documentary about the walt disney
company's obligation to do better for

256
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.799
its employees which you'd think would
have got on chapic's nerves but at least

257
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:46.080
in public he seemed unfazed profit has
been his main defense he took over as

258
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.280
ceo of the company on february 25th 2020
as the pandemic was just starting to be

259
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.919
taken seriously as a significant global
concern less than a month later he took

260
00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:00.480
the unprecedented step of closing all
disney theme parks around the world in

261
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.240
florida the shutdown lasted from march
to july of 2020.

262
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.320
in california it lasted for 13 months in
the first fiscal quarter of 2022 chapic

263
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.799
reported 7.2 billion dollars in revenue
from disney parks experiences and

264
00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:20.799
products boasting all-time high revenues
rick munarez a financial analyst said

265
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:24.559
that while posting that kind of profit
is helpful it's not the largest

266
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:28.799
indicator of how well the company is
doing overall since disney was the worst

267
00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:34.159
performing stock of the dow 30 in 2021
mostly due to the fact that disney plus

268
00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:39.760
under chapic's guidance isn't set to
turn a profit until at least 2024 at

269
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.559
best
which means he needs to squeeze every

270
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:46.640
penny out of every other part of the
company that he can in the meantime so

271
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.559
that he doesn't look even worse to
stockholders but the cuts and what some

272
00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.240
fans perceive as unabashedly putting
profits over people

273
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.360
has led to discontentment among fans
reaching such a fever pitch that it's

274
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.240
extending far beyond the echo chamber of
disney blogs when you spend the most

275
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.320
amount of money you've ever spent and
you go and you have a substandard

276
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.640
experience worse than before
and this is multiplied by the fact that

277
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.559
it's so crowded
these are all things that kind of entice

278
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:20.799
this
extreme dissatisfaction theme park

279
00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:24.799
expert scott smith told the washington
post earlier this year isn't it while

280
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:29.280
the theme park expert is a job chapic
though is in a unique position as far as

281
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.039
ceos of multi-billion dollar
corporations go disney is first and

282
00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:37.120
foremost in the business of making money
but unlike almost every other giant

283
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.600
corporation it doesn't want to be seen
that way by the general public people

284
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.039
feel as though they have a personal
investment in disney because disney

285
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:49.760
markets itself as having a personal
investment in the happiness of its fans

286
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.720
by creating the idea that disney is a
safe place for people a place where they

287
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.400
will feel loved and supported the same
way that they do or

288
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.880
want to in their own homes they create a
higher standard of relationship between

289
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.159
the company and its customers that's why
disney doesn't use that term at all

290
00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:14.320
rather customers are guests always but
it's also why because chapic has been so

291
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.640
transparent in his monetary motivations
and so apparently blind to guests

292
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.400
unhappiness so many of the people who
have bought into this idea feel like

293
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.799
he's letting them down and because fans
of the company are losing faith

294
00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:31.120
so are many who work for the house of
mouse it's an odd situation for the

295
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.400
company to be in
over the last three decades disney has

296
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.600
only had two ceos one of whom oversaw
the disney animation renaissance and the

297
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.360
other oversaw disney becoming the
biggest media company in the world

298
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.080
enough goodwill among fans was built up
over those last three decades that many

299
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.480
people defaulted to let disney have it
they'll do it right anytime a particular

300
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.520
franchise was floundering and now people
are looking at disney with derision

301
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.520
so
what does all this have to do with the

302
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.679
owl house well
i just wanted to point out how big of a

303
00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:07.919
tool bob chavic is his reluctance to
come out against the don't say gay bill

304
00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:12.320
really rubbed me the wrong way but the
real reason i'm talking about him is

305
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.080
timing
you see the owl house first started

306
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.080
airing in january of 2020 and was
renewed for a second season before the

307
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.120
first episode even aired that's how much
faith disney had in the show and it was

308
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.280
well founded faith with the show
receiving widespread critical acclaim

309
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.840
multiple awards and shockingly solid
ratings with a saturday morning cartoon

310
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.679
especially in the age of just sitting
your kid down in front of netflix and

311
00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:42.400
letting their brains melt the second
season premiered in june of 2021 but in

312
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.360
may of 2021 a month earlier disney
announced the cancellation of the show

313
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.760
giving it three 42-minute long episodes
to wrap everything up instead of a

314
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.320
proper full third season what was the
big difference at disney between january

315
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:02.000
of 2020 and may of 2021 well the ceo
went from being a guy who argued for gay

316
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.080
marriage legalization even threatening
to stop donations to the obama

317
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.520
re-election campaign in 2012 if the
president didn't come out in favor of it

318
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.880
to a guy who kept silent when the
florida government started passing

319
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.520
legislation that erased queer people
from classrooms that's quite a drastic

320
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.240
shift and where season one saw lose and
amity have an obvious crush on each

321
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.120
other
season two went right ahead and made

322
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.440
them a couple introduced a non-binary
former and likely current love interest

323
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.039
for eda and introduce hunter who many
believe is being set up for a gay

324
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.919
pairing with gus which is
a little problematic given the four-year

325
00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:43.200
age gap but
hunter's a little bit

326
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.200
emotionally stunted from his lifelong
tenure in

327
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.720
the magical hitler youth boot camp and
gus only ever associates with older kids

328
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.080
so let's just say they're really good
friends

329
00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.080
and maybe even roommates someday the
further queering of the show in season

330
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.799
two probably didn't sit well with a ceo
who openly cares more about profit than

331
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:09.600
people and sees queer characters as
tokens to never be confirmed and only

332
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.480
really exist when the golden goose known
as kevin feige says so so before season

333
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.960
two even got off the ground he clipped
its wings i know it hasn't been

334
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.480
confirmed that he was the one who made
the final decision but it reeks of him

335
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.960
so he's getting the blame and season two
is even better than season one with even

336
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.200
more critical praise and an increase in
the ratings as teenagers and even adults

337
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.480
started to find the show and fall in
love with its characters but that didn't

338
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.640
matter because it was already canceled
dead witch walking

339
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.039
because it didn't fit the brand

340
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.060
well what the hell is the disney brand
anyway

341
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.200
[Music]
time for me to use that marketing degree

342
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.279
simply put a brand as a promise to your
customer when describing a brand it's

343
00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:01.120
tempting to simply list the attributes
of a business describe the product line

344
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.919
or point to the logo and tagline but a
brand is more than that it's a unique

345
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:10.559
benefit for your customers the walt
disney company presents itself as more

346
00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:16.000
than just a business it is an authentic
american icon an honest-to-goodness rags

347
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.640
to riches story of one man who struck
out and made it big and did everything

348
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.720
he could to crush unions along the way
but the walt disney company's promise

349
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.760
has always been to be bringers of joy as
walt said we need to create joy not for

350
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.919
children but for the children in each of
us the brand identity of any brand

351
00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:37.919
consists of the way the company
identifies itself through the products

352
00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:42.720
or services sold and the image it
presents in the case of disney the

353
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.880
company is named after walt disney
proper name he even inspired the logo of

354
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.000
the company through his handwritten
signature which is part of the brand

355
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.880
identity of disney to this day there are
entire font families based on walt's

356
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.760
handwriting this direct connection to
its founder is also a part of the disney

357
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.600
brand as the walt disney company is one
of the very few corporations in the

358
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.880
world with a founder mythology now
disney is unique for a lot of reasons

359
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.120
but this one is kind of bonkers disney
has fostered a clear sense of identity

360
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.080
built just as much around walt disney
himself as it is the media it produces

361
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.919
other corporations and even studios tend
to lean away from using their own

362
00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:27.200
founders as a mascot for various reasons
a person is singular and a person can be

363
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.799
fallible
but more importantly a person is boring

364
00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:36.000
who stands for this company just a dude
okay people pack bond easier with a

365
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.480
mascot like tony the tiger walt disney
perpetuated a sense of personality to

366
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.480
the company it's easy to strip the
fursuit mascot away and realize that

367
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.520
it's just a sad old capitalist man
working for kellogg's but with disney

368
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.480
you push the cardboard cut out of mickey
mouse down and there's kindly mr disney

369
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.880
it's an extra layer of deception that
walt fostered in his own lifetime we

370
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.120
don't think about the founders of
corporations look at 20th century fox

371
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.760
before the merger fox studios was
founded by william fox both the g and m

372
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.279
of mgm were named for samuel goldwyn and
louis b mayer disney not only wants walt

373
00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:18.080
disney to remain relevant in a modern
discussion of media but almost venerates

374
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.360
this man in a way few corporations do of
their founders the only companies i can

375
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.760
think of with a founder mythology are
like

376
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.799
apple but steve jobs notoriously gave
zero f words about how other people

377
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:35.360
perceived him very early on walt disney
established the production company as a

378
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.640
family brand family owned family
operated family safe a movie studio that

379
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.399
would produce films the whole family
could enjoy from the youngest children

380
00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:49.039
to the oldest grandparents enchanting
young kids and bringing adults back to

381
00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:53.440
their childhoods he's quoted as saying
you're dead if you aim only for the kids

382
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.080
adults are only kids grown up anyway one
could also say adults are just kids with

383
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.120
bank accounts disney offers multiple
promises to these families a disney

384
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.679
resort promises that you will enjoy your
time it's one of the most important

385
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:12.080
promises of its company a disney film
promises to be enjoyable by the whole

386
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.200
family without excluding anyone with
content wholly too mature for kids or

387
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.159
too juvenile for adults the disney
experience promises to be available to

388
00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:26.240
everyone no matter how rich or poor if
you can't afford to take your kids to

389
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.799
the parks there's always the movies and
the disney company promises not to break

390
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:34.720
these aforementioned promises and in
doing so will allow you to build

391
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.200
memories to last a lifetime those are
the promises that the disney corporation

392
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.840
has been making to customers since the
1930s in the year 2000 an extra promise

393
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.320
was added disney promised to tell
stories for every child no matter where

394
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.279
they're from
what they believe or what color their

395
00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.799
skin is enter the disney princesses
becoming the most diverse bunch of

396
00:29:54.799 --> 00:30:00.000
skinny girls on a toy shelf but when you
ask a disney executive what their brand

397
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.039
is
they will simply say stories

398
00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:10.399
old stories new stories fairy tales
myths legends parables and epics stories

399
00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:15.360
for the whole family stories that
exemplify what is right and just whether

400
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.600
disney ever actually was as
all-inclusive and family-friendly as

401
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.520
they'd like to pretend is up for debate
the whiteness of the company's movies

402
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.840
didn't start to change until the 1990s
at which point the female characters of

403
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.600
color were universally fetishized
jasmine pocahontas esmeralda all women

404
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.720
of color all far less clothed than snow
white sleeping beauty bell or cinderella

405
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.720
so if disney's brand is family friendly
animated entertainment as well as

406
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:48.159
inclusivity i would imagine that the owl
house would fit their brand perfectly

407
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:53.679
it's got magic fun characters appeals to
kids and adults and as toyetic as all

408
00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.919
hell
and yet

409
00:30:55.919 --> 00:31:00.799
it didn't fit the brand
has their brand changed or

410
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:04.559
is it that the inclusivity part of their
brand was never meant to include girls

411
00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:08.960
who kiss girls or boys who kiss boys or
people who don't identify as either

412
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.080
let's say for a moment
that

413
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.960
disney actually does love their queer
fans and the owl house really did just

414
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.120
not fit the disney brand because it has
changed

415
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.799
well
what the hell is the disney brand

416
00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:32.080
today
[Music]

417
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.159
there's little you can do or say to
convince me that there was a rational

418
00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:40.320
reason for the owl house's cancellation
good ratings good reviews are one thing

419
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.080
but the fact that the show attracted an
older audience is another thing entirely

420
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.760
and a citation for the program's
cancellation

421
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.080
was the older demographic it was
attracting the mindset is that if the

422
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.200
wrong age bracket was tuning into the
show

423
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.279
product lines directed at six to eleven
year olds would be less inclined to buy

424
00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.440
ad space but there's nothing saying that
disney couldn't adapt and put the show

425
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.360
at a later time slot for more
appropriate consumer demographics

426
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.000
there's also nothing saying that the
executives wouldn't be aware that disney

427
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.080
plus was in late stage development and
realized that adult audience cartoons

428
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.320
tend to do well on streaming services
there's simply no reason why you don't

429
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.640
want an incredibly toyetic show directed
at an adult audience

430
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:30.240
who have an abundance of expendable
income there is after all a sub industry

431
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.799
at disney geared at marketing their
princesses for themed weddings and

432
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.720
funerals
yes funerals times like this make it

433
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.480
seem like the executive thought process
at disney is powered by a single gerbil

434
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.760
on a wheel but even in a quote-unquote
bad time slot the owl house got decent

435
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.519
ratings as it was
and in the end the rationale given to

436
00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:56.080
terrace was that her show didn't fit the
disney brand which at first seems

437
00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.080
self-apparent enough that it almost
makes sense and then you think about it

438
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.559
for more than two seconds and it's like
what brand because it's true there was a

439
00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:10.960
very carefully crafted media environment
that was meticulously kept by walt

440
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.000
disney but that brand also carried on
after walt passed away even when the

441
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.760
company was nothing but the disney vault
and straight to video flops and cheap

442
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.679
sequels but today does it still carry as
much weight

443
00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:28.240
now that disney has as many ips under
its belt as it does can we say that

444
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.279
everything fits into the brand does it
expand the brand in which world does the

445
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:38.720
disney brand include a they all die at
the end movie like rogue one allusions

446
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.440
to alcoholism in iron man 2 or in doctor
strange 2 with marvel's favorite mom

447
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.240
gone slasher monster not to mention the
wanton violence across either franchise

448
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.440
and the way that either franchise
struggles to fit into the disney brand

449
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.880
when they try to force it referencing
the book of boba fett in the titular

450
00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:00.000
character's newfound no killing rule and
even today disney has left their

451
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.640
princess brand by the wayside for some
time the princess and the frog faced

452
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.560
upfront criticism over representation
and stunt voice casting

453
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.800
and took some time to find a fan base
tangled struggled to find an audience

454
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.879
and while frozen did have a massive
upfront success it did so while

455
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:20.800
distancing itself from the typical
princess formats to be a movie about two

456
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.760
estranged sisters healing a bond but to
make these kinds of features with these

457
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.839
kinds of messages ones which can appeal
to older audiences as well as the

458
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:33.919
targeted younger ones the studio has to
be willing to let narratives dive into

459
00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:39.359
conflicts which are not strictly in line
with the media environment that walt

460
00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:43.919
would have approved of and while the
company is still married to its archaic

461
00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:47.919
image in order to keep up with the
modern mediascape there are a handful of

462
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:52.639
aforementioned instances where certain
medias rest uncomfortably

463
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:57.920
outside the strict parameters however as
disney adds so many exceptions to the

464
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.720
disney guidelines is the brand itself
becoming too vague the more disney

465
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.599
expands alters and permits free radicals
to perpetuate the modern disney culture

466
00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:12.320
the more holes get poked into the brand
itself what exactly is the disney brand

467
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.000
today i see the collapse of the disney
brand beginning with the pirates of the

468
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.520
caribbean
yes it was inspired by a ride at disney

469
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.320
world disneyland the one in florida
however the film let itself go into

470
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.520
uncharted waters michael eisner then ceo
was sure that the film would be a

471
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.560
disaster the film had violence
alcoholism and a no small amount of

472
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.480
horror the stakes were real
and there was a palpable threat to the

473
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.880
main cast for the first time disney
produced a non-animated feature that was

474
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.960
able to reach cultural permians and it
worked with the pirates franchise

475
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:53.599
bringing in over 4.5 billion dollars and
if it worked once it would work again i

476
00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:58.480
can argue that disney had two brands
their established brand and a developing

477
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.200
brand for their live action stuff one
which would dry in an older audience who

478
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:09.040
may scoff at new disney properties one
that was more adventurous daring and not

479
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.599
quite so safe and ever since then disney
has been moving its animated and

480
00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:18.400
live-action media to more overlapping
spaces to the point where i suppose we

481
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.320
can say that the disney brand exists in
the same way that the british empire

482
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.200
exists
it's more of a concept that still

483
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.000
occupies a couple of its territories but
when referring to the british empire we

484
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.240
reference the thing that it was at its
peak so when bob chapic says that the

485
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.880
owl house doesn't have a place on the
network because of the disney brand

486
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.960
is he referring to the disney brand of
old or the disney brand of today

487
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.400
if the disney brand is the scapegoat for
why the owl house got thrown under the

488
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.119
bus
then i think it's interesting to examine

489
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:54.800
what about the owl house is so
incompatible because the owl house

490
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.480
honestly feels more like classic disney
than a lot of the other content that's

491
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.119
going up the only thing that is
particularly outstanding in this regard

492
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:07.440
is the comfort the show has in depicting
various gender expressions and

493
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.520
identities
namely the gay stuff the series did take

494
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.160
its time to build up the in your face
queerness strategically waiting until

495
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.800
viewers were too invested to really
hold it against the show and given the

496
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.119
strong ratings through the second season
when the queer stuff really began to

497
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:30.850
appear it's clear that most audiences
weren't uncomfortable with it either

498
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:37.040
[Music]
regardless of whether the final decision

499
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.839
came from bob chapic or not his job is
to make the company money and shepherd

500
00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:45.599
the disney brand it's hard to cancel
something that's getting good ratings

501
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:50.160
but if you wanted it gone
he could simply cite the disney brand as

502
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.359
an excuse
the problem has just demonstrated the

503
00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:57.440
disney brand is so threadbare these days
that it exists more in concept than in

504
00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.960
practice and if the brand is so
tyrannical that it's costing the company

505
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.880
a franchise that earned one of the
highest accolades for writing excellence

506
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.040
while at the same time developing an
ever-growing dedicated fan base

507
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.520
maybe the brand isn't good for business
the only tangible excuse at the end of

508
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.240
the day is bigotry and if chapic is
letting bigotry lead his decision making

509
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.200
for the company even if he is using the
brand as a scapegoat he's just bad at

510
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.280
business especially after the florida
controversy over the don't say gay bill

511
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.680
disney lost whatever queer credibility
it had left queer audiences were some of

512
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.680
the most dedicated disney fans in the
world but with the company's reluctance

513
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.160
to recognize queer characters in their
media bleeding over into real life

514
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.200
we saw the consequences of queer erasure
spilling out into actual legislation if

515
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.920
there was any time for disney to put up
or shut up it was then during that one

516
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.079
week period when these laws were the
make or break point of being passed in

517
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:59.680
the southern states where disney
conducts enough of its business to sway

518
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.320
the politicians they endorse even leaks
at disney said the word was to remain

519
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.400
radio silent nothing was being planned
or prepared according to rumor by

520
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.880
mandate from chapic himself and when a
statement was released it was just the

521
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.200
normal power for the course statement
you'd expect and meanwhile

522
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.320
while this was going on disney
apparently

523
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.880
was developing a movie to be released
later this year strange world which

524
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.599
itself has an ensemble cast though the
central character

525
00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:34.000
is a gay teenager
while on the surface we might say oh

526
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.440
finally after everything i am
considerably more cynical about disney

527
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.839
and their alleged gay representation and
this prompted me to consider how disney

528
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:48.800
could manifest a good relationship with
queer representation okay so

529
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.160
disney's put money behind the film to
push it through production

530
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.160
given the timing and how long animated
films take to make this was likely a

531
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:02.160
film approved by bob iger it seems funny
to me that not a single soul outside of

532
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.319
disney caught wind that this project was
happening until six months from release

533
00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:10.720
when it comes to nearly any other disney
feature the press starts talking about

534
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.119
them years in advance disney has even
announced a movie so far ahead that they

535
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:18.319
even end up being canceled in
development remember gigantic it was

536
00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:23.760
announced in 2015 for 2019 released but
was cancelled in 2017. so disney making

537
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.400
strange world alone isn't going to do
anything to sway my opinion disney will

538
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.440
need to release the movie in a way that
matches

539
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:37.119
how they would build up hype for
frozen or a live-action remake i have to

540
00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:41.839
see that the studio wants people to see
this movie that the executives are

541
00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:46.319
willing to stand behind it and prop it
up with other movies

542
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:49.839
that they're so proud of
unlike the owl house

543
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:53.280
which disney
not only did nothing to promote but has

544
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:59.280
not produced nor licensed a single piece
of tie-in merchandise where's my plush

545
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.079
king damn it what about hooty i'll host
lego sets probably better to support

546
00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:08.560
etsy creators anyway but if disney
releases strange world quietly without

547
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.359
any marketing budget hoping that it will
be entirely forgotten

548
00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:17.040
that will send a clear message that the
company has no ongoing interest in

549
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.839
promoting queer stories that they are
ashamed of queer stories and that they

550
00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:26.400
see no value in queer stories the
queerness is something disney doesn't

551
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.680
even want to associate with but is only
willing to interact with insofar as it

552
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.960
gets the angry monkey off their back but
what will happen regardless

553
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.079
is the gay media hailing disney for
giving it to us even if disney corporate

554
00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:46.079
acts like it would rather strange world
never existed and while disney cut the

555
00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:50.720
check and threw it out there they're
doing nothing to ensure people

556
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.079
either know about it or watch it
disney's not actually giving us anything

557
00:41:56.079 --> 00:42:00.079
they're dropping it and then
will blame us for not making it

558
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:05.680
successful and then using that lack of
success to justify queer identities as

559
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.440
box office poison it was always dana
terrace that gave us the owl house

560
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.240
i'm not willing to give disney the
credit when it was made abundantly clear

561
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.640
that the mouse didn't want anything to
do with it

562
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:26.079
[Music]
if you don't mind me being

563
00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:29.920
really cynical for a minute what does it
really mean for a show like the owl

564
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.400
house to get cancelled this is a more
significant blow than you would think

565
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.720
because while other media may include
queer characters there can be problems

566
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.319
with this
the more benign manifestation of visible

567
00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:45.839
queerness is characters whose queerness
is incidental and not indicative of the

568
00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:49.760
plot this is evident in media i have
covered like the old guard which is

569
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.319
valid but visibility is all it
accomplishes alternatively you have

570
00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:58.079
stories where the plot is built around
queerness like heartstopper and young

571
00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:02.480
royals media has been built around
heterosexuality since

572
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.079
forever more annoyingly you have queer
characters who exist for a little more

573
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:10.839
than providing a presentation about the
validity of queerness itself which is

574
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:14.560
annoying
because it's not straight people who

575
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.000
need queer characters but the owl house
is this anomaly because while it

576
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.240
included incidental queerness it also
had something to say

577
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.800
about the state of queerness itself
the series used textual language to not

578
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.160
only afford a queer audience with
visibility

579
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.040
but use subtextual language to encode
themes and statements about the queer

580
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.920
community i got to read messages in a
piece of media that reflect my very

581
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:48.240
experiences of being queer i mentioned
above that the owl house does like to

582
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.880
take a stance on social conformity and
normative conditioning that being

583
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.280
the way a society enforces specific
values these collective values and the

584
00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.240
people who embody and enforce them are
what we refer to as the hegemony for

585
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.480
those who are curious the hegemony
exists due to social tradition that

586
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.359
enforces certain elements of culture and
they are imparted on us from the day we

587
00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:15.920
are conceived the language you speak the
fashion of the day social trends

588
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.200
technology biases and prejudices these
are all things that contribute but even

589
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.319
things like being
wrapped in a blue or pink blanket when

590
00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:29.040
you're born being given toy trucks or
dolls on your first birthday are all

591
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.359
things people do to push you into
becoming what society expects you to be

592
00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:38.240
for many people those roles are inert
and benign most people really don't mind

593
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.440
going along with these social
expectations and that's perfectly fine

594
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.760
for them the problem becomes and this is
where the queerness and the owl house

595
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.680
are concerned when social conformers
punish those who do not or cannot

596
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.880
conform to these hegemonistic values
this is where the just be yourself

597
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.440
messaging in the 90s came from in
children's programming following the

598
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.359
hyper-conformity of reagan's 1980s there
was a reactive push to encourage

599
00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:09.359
children to manifest the person they
were rather than the person society

600
00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:12.480
badgered them into being content like
this

601
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.880
rarely goes as far as the owl house does
to outline exactly what it means to be a

602
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.359
social outsider beyond getting bullied
by the popular kids or disappointing

603
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:24.800
your parents and the owl house kind of
gets it right

604
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.680
getting bullied kind of is the surface
level manifestation of being a social

605
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.960
outsider
but and queer people can especially

606
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.520
relate to this is far from the only way
that society has to badger you into neat

607
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.280
little boxes there's a much larger
systemic problem when it comes to

608
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.240
strictly enforced social standards from
a top-down authoritarian standpoint

609
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.800
society is easier to control when a
ruling party can limit life tracks that

610
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.839
are available to individuals because
they in turn can control the tracks in

611
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:59.599
the boiling isles there are nine paths
covens

612
00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:04.079
with slight variations to accommodate
subgroups i can't really say our society

613
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:08.400
has many more if anything our society
has markedly less but then you realize

614
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.200
that the boiling isles themselves are an
escape from luz's life

615
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.680
where she's being forced into one of
these projected paths in the human realm

616
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.440
it's not a stretch to say that the
principal allegory of the show is louis

617
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.760
abandoning contemporary society in lieu
of a queer society

618
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:30.319
akin to a country kid moving to the big
city for college and then learning that

619
00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:35.040
this magical queer world isn't
quite how why a literature makes it out

620
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.520
to be there isn't the social scape of a
bunch of disparate scrappy folks working

621
00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:44.079
together to facilitate community values
there's fragmentation tribalism

622
00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:48.160
internalized queer phobia and thrice as
many gatekeepers as there are

623
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.560
distinguishable identities lose faces
the same challenges the second she gets

624
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.560
to magic school she's forced into a
spell track that will determine what

625
00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.400
school of magic she will study for the
rest of her life her friend willow

626
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.160
already demonstrated how difficult it
can be to change this track and by the

627
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.079
end of season 1 we discover that the
fate which awaits those who do not

628
00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:11.440
conform
is imprisonment

629
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.200
in the conformatorium and that's only
for witches who passively avoid the

630
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.240
system for witches like eda who directly
challenge the establishment they await

631
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.720
public shame and execution
lose struggles with conformity she wants

632
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.880
the simple things by witch standards
however she is immediately faced with

633
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.160
criticism simply because humans lack the
anatomy to perform typical magic and

634
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.599
even though luz discovers how to study
magic through discovering four

635
00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:43.680
combinable glyphs around the isles she
is constantly decried as a fake witch

636
00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.359
it's a struggle for her to convince
classmates and grown-ups to take her

637
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:51.839
seriously many don't believe she has a
place in the boiling isles the place she

638
00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:57.200
escaped to in order to reject conformity
and suddenly luz is in an escapist

639
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.440
environment which has the very trappings
of the conformist society from which she

640
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.180
fled
welcome to the queer community

641
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:12.880
[Music]
where we don't have covens we have flags

642
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.400
and it's remarkable that a community
that recognizes gender fluid as an

643
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:22.000
identity is so inflexible about their
thinking about a range of identities

644
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.240
these are just labels that describe who
you are at a given time they're not your

645
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.960
destiny having the same label all your
life is okay but there's also no rules

646
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.359
against taking them off and putting them
on at will people change

647
00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:40.640
but because we are entering hegemonistic
spaces we need to fit into the boxes

648
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.280
that the hegemony likes to use to
classify everything that is outside the

649
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.880
norm it's like the only way we can get
accepted is if they get to ascribe neat

650
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.960
clinical titles to us like biologists
discovering a new species our acceptance

651
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.760
seems to be conditional on
classification and as with the owl house

652
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.599
if we can be classified then an
authority can control us and

653
00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:10.000
unfortunately a prime example of this
latent process of conditioning

654
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.040
as it affects us
is present within the owl house

655
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.640
because while there are lesbian and
bisexual women depicted and even fluent

656
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.240
use if they them pronouns for an
incidentally non-binary character the

657
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.280
limited depiction of gay men uses
probably my least favorite trope

658
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.920
the gay dads
generally bothered by the gay dads trope

659
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.760
a secondary character not the main
character but a character whose parents

660
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.240
are significant enough that they could
be featured in an episode or two will

661
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.720
have two dads for parents
in this case loses best friend willow

662
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.160
which in itself is not a bad thing some
people have gay dads some people are gay

663
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.280
dads gay dads have spent a lot of the
last century fighting for the ability to

664
00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:01.520
raise children but the problem becomes
when that's all we have as if that's the

665
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.119
only way executives are comfortable
depicting gay men at all i feel like

666
00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:08.400
terrace herself has earned the benefit
of the doubt from me and that if there

667
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.119
were any gay boys for lose to be around
they were cut from the show from on high

668
00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:16.720
but it's still disheartening to see that
willows fathers and the boys dancing at

669
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.800
grom are likely all we're going to get
the series does not have much longer to

670
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.480
wrap up a lot of loose ends and is
unlikely to introduce new characters in

671
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.079
relationship dynamics that are not
already in play especially gus and

672
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:32.480
hunter while displaying strong chemistry
together might be aged too far apart to

673
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.920
develop as anything other than good
friends or brotherly

674
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.440
but
why is this such a bad thing well

675
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.480
media's role in enforcing conformity is
to normalize various expressions it's

676
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.839
why representation in media is so
important the more people are confronted

677
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:56.319
with identities and ideas the more these
seem normal

678
00:50:56.319 --> 00:51:00.800
normalization through repetition this is
part and partial of why there is such an

679
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.400
outcry for women's representation for
different kinds of women and especially

680
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.079
different kinds of bodies more diverse
representation opens up more venues of

681
00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:15.119
perceivably valid self-expression it
helps if this is done in tandem with

682
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:19.040
real-world representation in order to
establish these identities as people

683
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.319
rather than just characters however it's
not a stretch to go from normalization

684
00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:28.880
to enforcing conformative values through
repetition the more a kind of identity

685
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.880
is depicted in the same way the more
little baby queers and others begin to

686
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.680
internalize various expectations for
what their life should look like when

687
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.800
children's programming is only
interested in depicting gay men as

688
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.119
married fathers of a secondary character
this establishes the expectations that

689
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:48.800
the role of gay men in society is to
perpetuate these traditional homemaking

690
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:55.280
values and gay men kinda get that kind
of conditioning if this is you

691
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.920
then that's your truth to live but there
is a sense of badgering and shaming

692
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.520
other gays who openly choose to leave
grindr on their phone after they

693
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.599
graduate from college it's the same way
the closeted gays with corporate jobs in

694
00:52:07.599 --> 00:52:12.319
the 80s would dismiss aids victims as
getting what was coming to them there is

695
00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:17.839
very much a drive to pressure other gay
men to put on airs for the straights you

696
00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:23.599
know to justify the validity of our
human rights and like the boiling isles

697
00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:29.599
the queer community manifests covens of
our own here it's okay to be different

698
00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:33.760
but not too different there it's okay to
be magic

699
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:38.400
but not too magic but bear in mind the
gatekeeping agenda of the boiling isles

700
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:44.319
was not enforced by natural magic users
emperor bellows was a human disguising

701
00:52:44.319 --> 00:52:49.680
himself as a witch his control and
compartmentalization of magic was always

702
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.000
conducted with the objective of
eradicating witches

703
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.760
is that also a parallel for the world's
queer gatekeeping

704
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.520
we like the witches of the boiling isles
fear public scrutiny and violence

705
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.200
against us
there the imaginary threat of wild magic

706
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.280
is used to justify oppression and
violence even though wild magic never

707
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.599
seems to cause any harm to anyone is
that really any different from recent

708
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:17.200
debates about
kink at pride parades many within the

709
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.680
community blame regressive anti-queer
legislation and book bannings on

710
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.640
sex-positive sentiments that we display
so we attack ourselves

711
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.800
because some of us don't want to give
straight people a reason to harm us

712
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.200
regardless of the fact that many of
these talking points i.e i did not

713
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.160
consent to your kink
were used verbatim against trans people

714
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.040
in public
in the 80s and earlier and that

715
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.880
historically speaking the hateful
straits do not often need a reason to

716
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.040
use violence against us just like
bellows as a human pretending to be a

717
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.359
witch in order to hunt them the
sentiments of self-oppression and

718
00:53:55.359 --> 00:54:00.160
gatekeeping in the queer community are
either derived from internalized phobias

719
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.000
or
reactions to violence threats

720
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.240
and regressive laws
if we live in fear of the heterohegemony

721
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.040
then the hegemony can still control us
and instead we develop these queer life

722
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.079
tracks
to rock the boat as little as possible

723
00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:20.160
in the misguided belief that it will
give us more political clout to expand

724
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.359
our rights
because that's going swimmingly

725
00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:29.200
apparently what comes to mind
is that observing the last century queer

726
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.520
rites hit their greatest strides
when community attitudes were more

727
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.960
radical
periods where we put on suits get

728
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.000
offices and follow the appropriate
channels are

729
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.119
when we make compromises and various
letters to the acronym get left behind

730
00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:49.440
when critics call us groomers for even
existing shriveling up and molding

731
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.000
ourselves to be what they want isn't
going to advance our causes

732
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.119
just like democrats cowering at
republicans threatening to stage a

733
00:54:57.119 --> 00:55:01.440
filibuster is just shows us that
democrats can be coerced and it's hard

734
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:06.559
to be taken seriously when history shows
that you back down from a fight at the

735
00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:14.160
slightest sign of resistance
[Music]

736
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.839
thinking about it
disney could have used the owl house to

737
00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:22.240
gain so much good will from the queer
community just as jay

738
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.480
goes off the rails and becomes a flaming
bigot here comes this new franchise

739
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.760
filled with witches and wizards and
queer acceptance and representation

740
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.839
around every corner it could have been a
replacement for all the people who felt

741
00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:37.839
let down
by what she'd done and said disney could

742
00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:42.079
have positioned it as the harry potter
for all those abandoned by she who must

743
00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:47.440
not be named but they didn't
instead they killed it

744
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.000
they couldn't let it die because it was
thriving with a growing fan base instead

745
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.079
they killed it
they took this beautiful queer story

746
00:55:56.079 --> 00:56:01.119
this house where us weirdos are accepted
and embraced and they tore it down and

747
00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:04.960
we didn't say a thing about it
the fans did sure but the queer

748
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.839
community as a whole was just sort of
silent

749
00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:13.760
we've been doing that a lot lately not
just us queers but a lot of people when

750
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.200
we need to be loudest we go quiet
we weren't always this way you know i

751
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.760
mean the queer community we used to rise
up and demand our rights and protections

752
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.480
look at the aids crisis in the 80s and
90s sure there were a painful amount of

753
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.079
gays and nice cushy jobs telling
everyone to just keep quiet and wait for

754
00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:37.200
the cdc and fda to do their job to do
their research to spend a few years

755
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.440
maybe a decade running tests and trials
to find something that might help you

756
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.559
not die of hiv and aids just shut up and
wait but too many of us didn't have the

757
00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:49.760
luxury of waiting
we were in crisis

758
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.079
we needed to help now and so act up was
formed

759
00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:58.480
act up protested outside the new york
stock exchange the fda offices the cdc

760
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.960
offices inside of churches outside of
congress and even outside the homes of

761
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.440
anti-gay politicians its members were
arrested over and over again they were

762
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.079
demonized by straight society lambasted
by establishment gays the people with

763
00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:17.920
power looked at them like buzzing flies
that needed to be zapped but in the end

764
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.760
they did get more funding for aids
research they did get new drugs into a

765
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.880
speedier pipeline than the decade-long
wait that fda trials could take

766
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.880
it was their activism
their fighting that helped turn hiv and

767
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.440
aids from a death sentence to a
condition

768
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.520
you can not only live with
but live a perfectly normal life with

769
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.280
that reminds me of the owl house to be
honest there's a lot of passive

770
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:46.240
resistance to emperor bellows in the owl
house people inside and outside his

771
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.160
sphere of power doing a little bit here
and there to shake up his rule but

772
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.000
nothing too major he's even convinced
multiple witches to join his side

773
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.400
promising them influence and power once
his plans come to fruition just like so

774
00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.960
many queers bend the knee to
establishment power in real life for a

775
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.640
chance to get some power of their own
but just like in real life bellows

776
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:12.799
doesn't plan on ever giving them power
once he's finished they'll be dead and

777
00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:17.920
he'll be all the more powerful for it
they're nothing but pawns in his great

778
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.359
chess match
when people followed the right track

779
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:25.119
they set out before them
they were stabbed in the back

780
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:28.079
just like the queer community gets
stabbed in the back

781
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:31.760
look at same-sex marriage we did
everything the right way

782
00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.240
we took it through the courts and we won
but less than a decade later and it

783
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.359
looks like that same court with a few
different members

784
00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:44.240
might just reverse that decision
even though we did as we were told and

785
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.400
followed the rules
at the end of season two eda and lilith

786
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.520
send king and lose away on what they
think will be a long wild goose chase of

787
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.880
a quest
so long that they will be spared from

788
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.040
what will happen when emperor belos's
plans reach their zenith and what will

789
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.760
eda and lilith do in the meantime
give up

790
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.280
what more can they do
and i'm worried that a lot of people of

791
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:15.119
my generation and those older than me
are in the same mindset right now

792
00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:20.000
an activist conservative supreme court
is systemically removing rights from

793
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.839
people all over the country
but

794
00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:28.960
other than some angry tweets and
a couple of peaceful protests i'm not

795
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.040
seeing a whole lot of pushback
are we exhausted

796
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.000
have we been fighting the good fight for
too long

797
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.839
have we given up
are we surrendering the battle while

798
00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:43.520
shielding the next generation from it so
they can fight it later

799
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.760
maybe it's a rude awakening but the next
generation isn't being shielded or

800
00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.559
protected
and they know they're a part of the

801
00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:54.319
battle
every person with a uterus seeing the

802
00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:58.720
supreme court deleting their bodily
autonomy every trans kid being kicked

803
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.960
off their sports team or out of the
bathroom every gay kid being outed by

804
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.119
homophobic teachers and queer kids in
general watching as their states again

805
01:00:07.119 --> 01:00:11.599
and again take away their rights they
know the battle is happening

806
01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:16.640
and just like luz and amity and gus and
willow and hunter they're not backing

807
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.760
down from the fight
they're fighting back against the

808
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.200
destruction of their special magical
world

809
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.640
passive resistance doesn't work
it's never worked it's always been a

810
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.520
band-aid we slap onto a gaping wound to
say we did our part

811
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.520
we say it's necessary
so that the systems will accept us into

812
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.000
the club that we can't kick up too much
of a stink or else they'll get mad at us

813
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.079
and not give us what we need
why do we expect to be given anything

814
01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:53.040
we should be taking what we need not
just queer people but women and people

815
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.480
of color and disabled people and
everyone being crushed by the weight of

816
01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.359
the overpowered minority of rich white
cisgender men that dictates

817
01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:07.599
what rights we're allowed to have
we bend to their whims and do as they

818
01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:12.960
say but becoming what they want us to be
doesn't advance our cause it just

819
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.920
advances theirs
so i think like king at the end of

820
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.839
season two of the owl house maybe we
need to introduce a little bit of chaos

821
01:01:21.839 --> 01:01:26.559
into the system show them that their
control over us is an illusion they've

822
01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:31.599
tricked themselves into believing
we've been beaten down pretty hard

823
01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:35.839
before
by politicians and plagues

824
01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:41.680
but we still fought back we still rose
up and we still won

825
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.079
and so how pathetic are the cishet power
players of the world that they couldn't

826
01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:51.359
beat us at our worst
so go forth witches toppled the emperor

827
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:58.480
bellows of the world and conformity
i know we can do it

828
01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:02.680
we're kind of magical like that

829
