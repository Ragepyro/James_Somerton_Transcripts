9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
hey everyone we're going to do a simple
video this time no big fancy sets or

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
multiple cameras because I just want to
talk about the now officially Best

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.500
Picture Oscar nominated movie everything
everywhere all at once maybe the best

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.059
movie of 2022
so let's do a normal video essay for

13
00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.300
once and talk about something that's
just so

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:40.759
so good
[Music]

15
00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.880
there was never any indication that
everything everywhere all at once was

16
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.659
going to feature a prominent queer
character in fact from promotional

17
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
material nobody could really figure out
what the movie was going to be about at

18
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.259
all this movie dropped just as the
Multiverse hype was hitting its cusp

19
00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.060
bull Marvel and DC had been hyping their
prospective upcoming Multiverse movies

20
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.160
throughout 2020 and 2021 Multiverse of
Madness and Flashpoint had been

21
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.620
announced since forever ago even by then
and the Loki series also poked at this

22
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.300
idea other media like content on the CW
had toyed with this for a while there

23
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.959
was enough Multiverse Buzz that critics
leading up to everything everywhere's

24
00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.520
release were hailing it as the best
Multiverse movie probably a good thing

25
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.300
that it dropped sooner rather than later
because Multiverse of Madness had less

26
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.959
to do with multiverses and more to do
with demonizing women who have undergone

27
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.580
debilitating trauma made by men who
openly admitted to having no familiarity

28
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.060
with the preceding media and while
claiming to want to recreate the source

29
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.640
material clearly missed the point of
said Source material and Flashpoint is

30
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.019
yeah without knowing too much about the
plot the movie was promoted on martial

31
00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.760
arts set pieces Whimsical Vibes and
Michelle yo in general but what we got

32
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.599
was so much more we're gonna get into
spoilers here but if you do press on

33
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.780
without having seen the movie it's
definitely worth a watch afterwards

34
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.800
because there's so much more that I just
cannot get into here everything

35
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.720
everywhere all at once is about Evelyn
Quan Wang a Chinese immigrant who owns a

36
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.800
laundromat in America who left China
with her soon to be fiance because her

37
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
parents didn't approve of the
relationship Evelyn is stressed

38
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.340
overwhelmed and trying to take
everything on her shoulders on top of

39
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.580
her father gong gong moving into their
tiny apartment above the laundromat

40
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.200
Evelyn is struggling to connect with her
daughter Joy Joy is an out lesbian who

41
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.340
is begging her mother to acknowledge her
girlfriend to gong gong and in general

42
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.319
Evelyn deflects these requests claiming
that gong gong is very old-fashioned and

43
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.180
that she is just too busy to deal with
the Fallout though it is implied that

44
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.519
Evelyn isn't entirely comfortable with
it herself and brushes this off as a

45
00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.519
quirk not seeing the emotional toll that
it's taking on Joy Evelyn frequently

46
00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.019
gets lost in thoughts and Daydreams
about what her life could have been if

47
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.400
only she had made certain decisions
differently namely if she hadn't left

48
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.260
China to be with her present husband
Waymond who by the way has filed for

49
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.739
divorce she just doesn't know it yet
like most people who would rather

50
00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.820
disassociate from the reality of their
life Evelyn likes to dip her toes into

51
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.419
different hobbies and she uses the
laundromat to write off these expenses

52
00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.860
as side businesses which does not go
over well with their caseworker from the

53
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.199
IRS Deidra who gives them a few hours
for a second chance to clear up the

54
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.180
confusion on their tax returns though
Evelyn is certain it won't make any

55
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
difference she is however confronted by
her husband who takes on a strange

56
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.080
personality shift Waymond claims that he
is now Alpha Waymond from the alpha

57
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.020
verse in his home Universe Evelyn is a
brilliant scientist who developed verse

58
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.979
jumping a technology that can allow a
person to access alternate versions of

59
00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.600
themselves in different universes
each time someone makes a decision an

60
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.560
alternate universe branches off to
accommodate all outcomes of said

61
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.120
decision this verse jumping allows
someone to gain access to skills and

62
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.860
talents that they had gained in other
universes he warns Evelyn that a

63
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.840
powerful verse jumper is after her name
jobu tapaki after making her first verse

64
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.560
jump Evelyn is murdered by jobu only to
learn that it is her daughter

65
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.139
Joy
in the alpha verse Evelyn has worked

66
00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.940
with joy to test verse jumping she
pushed Joy beyond the safety limits and

67
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.280
split Joy's Consciousness apart
Joy now exists in all possible universes

68
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.060
at once flipping between different
versions of herself and swapping between

69
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.380
different elements of different
universes with this power she seeks to

70
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.300
conquer all universes for reasons yet
unknown after being exposed to a large

71
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.320
number of her own Universal variants
Evelyn's father is revealed to be the

72
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.419
leader of the resistance against joy as
Evelyn fights against both jobu tupaki

73
00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.180
and also gong's forces her mind
splinters exposing her to a wide range

74
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.139
of alternate realities that she inhabits
beginning to develop the same abilities

75
00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.120
as jobu she can draw from a multitude of
different versions of herself even in

76
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.780
universes not accessible to verse
jumping technology

77
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.160
she's off the damn map with each one she
experiences she begins to see every

78
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.139
other universe as better than the one
she currently inhabits she's a movie

79
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.060
star in the Kung Fu Evelyn Universe
she's a renowned singer in the stabs

80
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.440
eyes out accidentally Universe she's a
spinning sign woman and one Universe

81
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.100
which
maybe not a step up but she's got moves

82
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.699
by accident she stumbles upon the hot
dog finger Universe where she's a

83
00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.840
lesbian of course I mean if you've got
hot dog fingers why not and she's a

84
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.479
Master Chef in the rakakuna universe and
there are also variations of each of

85
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.840
these through her confrontations with
jobu across the variations of the

86
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.100
Multiverse it becomes clear that jobu
doesn't want to kill her mother while

87
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.319
she seems ambivalent toward killing
anyone else keep in mind jobu and or joy

88
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:13.319
is a being who exists in all versions of
herself simultaneously she sees no point

89
00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.539
in batting an eye over anything she does
because everyone she kills in one

90
00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.960
universe is still alive in another for
all their differences Joy can think of

91
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.580
no other person who is as disappointed
with their life as her mother and while

92
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.660
Joy was broken-hearted that her own
mother wouldn't stand up for her jobu is

93
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.660
only annoyed
I'm so sorry

94
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.240
you're still hung up on the fact that I
like girls she is annoyed that her

95
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.960
mother has chosen to close off herself
to a single way of thinking specifically

96
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.599
and indicates that her homophobia is a
symptom not the root of Evelyn's

97
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.860
problems when jobu shows Evelyn her
plans for the Multiverse Evelyn tries to

98
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.280
defend her actions saying that she just
doesn't want to upset her father this

99
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.120
late in life this different generation
you don't have to hide behind him

100
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.900
anymore jobu's Grand evil plan is that
she is constructing an everything bagel

101
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.660
with everything on it and she means
everything sesame seeds poppy seeds

102
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.639
airplanes lava lamps Art Deco hope
supernovas Saturday morning cartoons

103
00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:23.520
sadness and upon gazing at her great
work jobu realized that in the context

104
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.400
of everything
nothing

105
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.479
really mattered
it was all just there but there was no

106
00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.279
meaning to anything adding more and more
on to the bagel she just realized that

107
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.599
less and less really had any inherent
value she reveals that she was never

108
00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.099
seeking out Evelyn to kill her
she was seeking out a version of Evelyn

109
00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:49.080
who could understand Joy is an
emotionally intelligent lady and based

110
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.980
on Stephanie Jesus performance it's
clear to me that she can put her

111
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.180
mother's actions and beliefs in the
context of who her mother is what Evelyn

112
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.440
has dealt with in her life and
especially how Evelyn feels about it but

113
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.540
in another way that just makes Joy even
more bitter she sees how Evelyn is

114
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.279
living her life and how she is doing
nothing to change it if anything had any

115
00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.959
value surely Evelyn would put in a
little bit more effort to change and so

116
00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:19.440
this is why Joy feels that maybe a
version of her mother could be made to

117
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.420
understand exactly what this everything
bagel means instead overwhelmed Evelyn

118
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.040
demands to be returned to her normal
life where she's hosting a Chinese New

119
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.940
Year's party at her laundromat she wants
nothing to do with this verse jumping

120
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.500
stuff anymore even if she gets to be an
actress or a Kung Fu Master it's just a

121
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.540
fantasy but joy is there to remind her
that she can never unexperience the

122
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.700
mundanity of knowing just how sad her
life is and all those universes are

123
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.300
actually worse than a fantasy it's
visceral proof that she made the wrong

124
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.600
decisions in her life and that there's
nothing she can do to change her

125
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.459
circumstances in the laundromat Universe
her life is falling apart due to

126
00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:05.040
decisions she cannot unmake might as
well let it happen get over it and just

127
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.959
stop making decisions before she makes
it even worse for herself problem is

128
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:14.580
Evelyn's mind is still fractured and she
herself is like jobu simultaneously

129
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.140
existing in a myriad of realities she
cannot Escape these confrontations of

130
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.399
what her life is the pressure sends
Evelyn on a nosedive smashing a window

131
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.720
in the laundromat signing the divorce
papers getting smashed drunk and getting

132
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.440
disowned by her father alternate reality
Evelyn's aren't doing much better either

133
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.760
and it isn't until she sees weyman
trying to pull her back from the brink

134
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.200
that she comes around
all her varians begin to clean up their

135
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.500
messes
but Evelyn's mind splinters even further

136
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.019
and she is exposed to the full potential
of everything she could have been

137
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:53.399
some worse some better some even
animated but in the context of

138
00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:57.600
everything the multitude of infinite
possibilities and identities Evelyn

139
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.459
realizes that not one single action she
does in any one single Universe actually

140
00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:07.260
means anything there is no Ripple of
consequentialism there is no great Peril

141
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.459
to the world if she undertakes one
solitary decision because there are an

142
00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:15.300
infinite range of versions of herself
where the decision was never available

143
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.740
in the first place Evelyn sees that
nothing means anything but instead of

144
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.540
jobu's conclusion Evelyn understands
that this just means she has the freedom

145
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:30.480
to choose how she acts if nothing means
anything and that means nothing has any

146
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.680
real Cosmic consequences either our
ultimate choice is that we choose the

147
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.360
consequences that matter to us just as
laundromat Evelyn chose to live with the

148
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.040
consequences of leaving her family for
Waymond she begins to see what she got

149
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.959
out of that which was missing from other
universes and Evelyn chooses Joy both

150
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:54.180
feeling and the person because her Joy
means more to her than anything she

151
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.399
could have in all the other universes
combined

152
00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:05.640
queerness as it manifests in this movie
is not the driving force of the plot

153
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.720
Joy's queerness is a wedge between her
and Evelyn but the wedge was put there

154
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.620
by her mother
the plot frames Evelyn as the flawed

155
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.240
character whose narrative direction is
to overcome her flaws

156
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.959
and like I said homophobia was
symptomatic of her inability to grow and

157
00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:26.339
change simply because she did not
believe it was possible for her to

158
00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:30.959
change the onus of choice was not on Joy
to be straight but for Evelyn to choose

159
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:35.760
to accept it or not Evelyn herself is
alluded to be bisexual as she is married

160
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.680
to her IRS caseworker in the hot dog
fingers Universe though it is unclear if

161
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.519
this also applies to laundromat Evelyn
perhaps the message here is that we have

162
00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:48.360
the potential to be all things the more
we realize that the more we move toward

163
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.940
love and acceptance of others that our
belief that a choice is finite only ever

164
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.440
locks us into certain ways of thinking
in a movie entirely about choice

165
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.940
queerness is not a part of the
discussion it's not a choice

166
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.959
Joy's queerness factors into this film
only as far as generates conflict

167
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.680
between mother and daughter Joy
sexuality really only factors into the

168
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.180
plot as a straw that breaks the camel's
back even though this is what we see

169
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.899
characters reference any number of
events that strain the relationship

170
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:23.100
between Evelyn and joy in the past
beyond the textual references to Joy's

171
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.600
listless lack of Direction there is a
reading of this story where the universe

172
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.940
jumping doesn't happen instead it's just
a fantasy concocted by Evelyn or a

173
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:38.220
metaphor to describe events in Evelyn's
life Alpha Waymond describes Alpha

174
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.760
Evelyn's treatment of joy in the alpha
verse

175
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.600
saw her potential
so he pushed her

176
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.000
Beyond her limit we can extrapolate that
Evelyn in the laundromat Universe did

177
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.959
the same to Joy in her own way as Joy's
mind fractured and merged with every

178
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.380
other version of herself she could not
find a single world where she was living

179
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.519
up to her mother's expectations it makes
sense like many parents who had once

180
00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.060
been considered gifted children
themselves they see in their children

181
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.680
everything that they could not be by
proxy of their children they want to see

182
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.220
their own potential realized in
universes where she remained in China

183
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.899
for whatever reason Evelyn has only seen
in prestigious careers as a singer her

184
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:22.680
father has close at hand and this is the
only Universe where we see him Express

185
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.339
fondness towards her while the
particulars may be different character

186
00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:30.060
beats and personalities remain
consistent Across the Universe alternate

187
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.920
realities do a great deal to foil a
character against themselves bearing in

188
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.420
mind sequences cut between each other
sync up with events figurative actions

189
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.000
in one Universe are literal actions in
another

190
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.079
figurative actions in one Universe are
literal actions in another based on the

191
00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:49.560
dizzying editing flipping between
universes it's difficult to keep track

192
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.760
of which universe is which and which one
is the one with the narrative through

193
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.839
line we ought to be following
The Narrative description of Multiverse

194
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:01.980
fill in a whole lot of plot holes the
universe where Evelyn assaults diadra

195
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.820
may seem to be the main Universe however
this is the same universe where Joy

196
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.019
manifests or suicide bagel and the
universe we may assume to be the real

197
00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:13.980
one because it's more grounded and
handles the emotional conflict between

198
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.560
joy and Evelyn is actually a universe in
which Joy sent Evelyn to prove a point

199
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.880
this seems to carry on the Divergent
reality from Evelyn not punching Deidra

200
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.740
the universe we end with is not the
universe we began with but is the

201
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.760
universe we end with even a universe we
had seen before based on how the film

202
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.420
clips between universes the entire final
sequence of the movie may be

203
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.500
disconnected from the plot of the others
in fact when it comes to every single

204
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.579
other Universe with the exception of
maybe the hot dog finger lesbian

205
00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:49.500
Universe we do not entirely know how
they resolve

206
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.420
everything is
kind of left dangling narratively we the

207
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.220
audience are shown the emotional Beats
how each alternate universe ties into

208
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.360
character development and others that
have more of a through line thematically

209
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.860
the audience is being informed that what
happens is less important than how these

210
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.540
characters and by extension the audience
handle their interpersonal relations and

211
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.300
self-worth
who someone is matters more than what

212
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.620
someone does
but what's most important is how someone

213
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.920
feels the end of the film may be an
entirely different Universe altogether

214
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.160
one where Evelyn does have her [ __ ]
together and where she does have a

215
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.180
loving relationship with Waymond where
gong gong is a more supportive father

216
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.380
and less of a prick and where she is a
more supportive and accepting mother to

217
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.040
her gay child Becky

218
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.180
however what is not present in the film
though perhaps this is suggested is the

219
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.560
idea the choices absolutely can split
universes apart but they may also be

220
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.240
able to converge realities too
that conflict within the self may lead

221
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.660
to opposing decisions that splinter the
cosmos

222
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.280
but also that if one truly understands
that choices ultimately do not matter

223
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.199
the no choice needs to be made and
universes do not need to branch

224
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:18.600
finding peace with one's current
existence healing and mending

225
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.799
relationships can also heal the
separation between the universes Joyce

226
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:27.480
stands on a precipice where she has
learned that in the context of not only

227
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.340
one Cosmos but many objects and events
in reality do not matter

228
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.360
that is if all things matter the same
there is no singular thing that stands

229
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.660
out but she has existed in a family
environment where her feelings don't

230
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.980
matter so why would anything else
keeping in mind that her catalog of

231
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.539
what's on the everything bagel
does not include people Evelyn's

232
00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:52.440
realization as aforementioned was indeed
that nothing mattered but she came to

233
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.600
understand this as a liberating Factor
neither her taxes her father's approval

234
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.500
the laundromat nor the fact that her
husband wants to divorce her mattered

235
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.700
and with all of these external pressures
melted away she saw the root of her

236
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.000
misery
the amount of conflict she was pulling

237
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.780
into her life
because she was over focused on things

238
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.380
that didn't matter
the receipt with the black permanent

239
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.700
markers circling the unspecified dollar
amount just like Joe budapaki's

240
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.860
everything bagel it is a storm of bustle
but the center was empty

241
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:31.020
the value of the receipt was meaningless
contrasted against wayman's googly eyes

242
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:37.679
his playful Whimsy his empathy these are
things we often dismiss as meaningless

243
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:41.220
but at their core
aren't these the things that make life

244
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.380
worth living apparently Everything full
of actual nothing and apparently nothing

245
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.720
full of actual everything the difference
is perspective the inability to

246
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.500
distinguish which fits into which
category is indicative of a society that

247
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.059
has gone spiritually bankrupt and we
have been for some time all the things

248
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.679
we are told are important by society's
latent methods of conditioning us are

249
00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:09.000
the completely wrong things that we
should be focusing on instead where

250
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.919
value lies is the ability to see value
in everyone and everything and that if

251
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:17.580
putting googly eyes on everything is
necessary to help us pack Bond then

252
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.380
maybe that's necessary
even if it's ridiculous and also perhaps

253
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.039
we should Place more value on
ridiculousness because the more

254
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:30.480
seriously we take everything
the more the unserious things like

255
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.400
feelings begin to get left behind if the
stress and importance of life is placed

256
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.260
on stuffy things like business success
stability what value do Evelyn's dreams

257
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.000
and hobbies have what do Joy's queer
feelings even matter

258
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
when the Family Laundromat is being
audited

259
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.380
foreign
we are reminded that choices diverge

260
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.799
universes
but joy seems to be a lesbian in every

261
00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:01.740
Universe regardless of her or her
mother's choices

262
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.360
this is inescapable
the only choice is how individuals react

263
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.600
to it
and perhaps as a society we need to

264
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.380
begin evaluating what really is or is
not a choice

265
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.360
while some may report that in some
universes Evelyn is queer we must also

266
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.900
remind ourselves that she belongs to one
of the many generations where it was the

267
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.280
social expectation for bisexual people
especially women to force themselves

268
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.720
into heterosexual thinking over the
years many bisexual people have had to

269
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.799
dismiss their same gender attractions
because society never really let them

270
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:39.179
explore it again the choices and the
reaction to this information

271
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:44.580
the decision whether to or not accept
this about oneself can cause drastic

272
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.600
shifts in how one lose their life in our
evolving world of queerness one of the

273
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.500
most significant discussions we are
having is how to navigate bigotry at

274
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.940
home at times queer commentators will
sometimes make sweeping generalizations

275
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.380
and statements about the improving
condition of queer acceptance within

276
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.240
their own families and I do this from
time to time myself however even in

277
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.919
America and what Global Society
misguidedly refers to as the West there

278
00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:14.820
is still a widespread pressure for
families to produce heterosexual

279
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.320
children and especially when it comes to
trans teenagers and even early trans

280
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.980
identifying children
there seems to be a whole lot of

281
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.900
questions about how to raise them
there's an overall confusion arising

282
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:33.780
around the intersection between
sexuality gender and sex even parents

283
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.280
who are otherwise on board with trans
acceptance can be squeamish about the

284
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:44.280
idea of their child transitioning
cynically I may suggest that in the rush

285
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.360
for widespread acceptance
we never really described what

286
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:55.640
acceptance looked like and now we as
teenagers young adults and

287
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.820
adults are struggling with how to
redirect our language regarding how we

288
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:05.340
are treated by those closest to us mere
tolerance it turns out can be quite

289
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.460
toxic
but among people for whom tolerance was

290
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.440
a struggle asking for something more can
feel like asking too much in the film's

291
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.000
opening as much as Evelyn is tolerant of
Joyce sexuality she certainly seems to

292
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.919
resent that she has to be the best she
can offer is passive ignorance why put

293
00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:26.580
in the effort when the choice to give
one's attention to the black hole that

294
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.659
is the family business is right there
this is the trauma of queer tolerance

295
00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:35.340
where we see our family making an effort
but we also see what that effort amounts

296
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.539
to we see all the other things that are
more important than trying to care some

297
00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:43.080
of us see the hierarchy of value and we
see that our feelings and personal

298
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.000
dignity are fairly low on the checklist
some of us begin to see that our family

299
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.100
only really cared about us as an idea
and that maintaining the idea of us is a

300
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.299
whole lot more important than validating
who we actually are queer estrangement

301
00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:02.159
exists for this reason and is quite
common probably taking over from queer

302
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:06.900
disownment the pendulum has swung the
other way and many of us simply can't

303
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.460
reconcile our relations with family
it's nothing so trivial as parents just

304
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:17.400
don't understand it is rooted in parents
refusing to change their understanding

305
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.840
and having lived with them for our
entire lives we see how much they are

306
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.620
capable of and we see that their
capability seems to end with changing

307
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.440
their minds about us
when our personhood diverges from the

308
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.260
expectation of what we should be
we really begin to see how much we mean

309
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.460
to these people who have meant the world
to us

310
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.720
and we watch as the language of
Tolerance leads them to believe that

311
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.159
their efforts are enough and we
internalize our emptiness as

312
00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:54.780
in gratitude we can either exist in
their lives feeling guilty for wishing

313
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.500
for more or we can put distance between
us and our family

314
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.480
there's nothing you or anyone can do to
change someone's mind once it's made up

315
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.039
after a while it gets overwhelming
all you can do is control your own

316
00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:12.260
feelings and your own decisions and
sometimes it is easier to cut and run

317
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.100
because others may not have the capacity
to understand the difference between

318
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:24.419
their choices and who you are and Evelyn
escaped this by realizing that nothing

319
00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.820
mattered just got tired of pessimistic
cynicism time to get wired I'm

320
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.960
liberating nihilism if gender doesn't
matter what do any of these reservations

321
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.260
and feelings and Hang-Ups matter if
nothing matters neither social

322
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.059
expectations family conditioning polite
appearances then who cares who does what

323
00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:46.620
as long as nobody's hurting anybody
including themselves

324
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.360
shouldn't avoiding that kind of pain be
the objective and if that is the

325
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.100
objective as many say it is why aren't
we building a world that is focused on

326
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.320
connection emotions fulfillment why are
we still obsessing over expectations and

327
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.820
vaguely defined parameters of success if
nothing else matters

328
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.140
what does matter is how you feel about
others and how you feel about yourself

329
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.700
in a world where everything is fluid and
flexible and maybe does or does not

330
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.320
actually exist your feelings are the
only things that you can guarantee to be

331
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.559
true
truly true

332
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:26.520
and if the structure of the world is
composed of our memories then the

333
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.260
goodness or evil of the world is
predicated on your past choices and

334
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.640
whether or not they are choices that you
are proud of or that you regret and the

335
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.720
thing about pride is that there is no
real qualification for that you can

336
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.380
choose to qualify your self-worth based
on external factors comparing yourself

337
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.000
to others or expectations imposed on you
but for all that nothing else matters

338
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.020
you and your feelings are the only
things you can be certain of

339
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.240
you can choose your own expectations and
you can choose to meet them or not

340
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.919
you can choose to see the hole in the
center of the bagel as emptiness

341
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:04.799
where you can choose to see it as
freedom

342
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:09.059
you can look at the googly eyes as a
ridiculous waste of time or you can

343
00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:12.779
choose to understand that someone is
trying to lift the burden of the world

344
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:16.620
off your shoulders but you cannot choose
not to exist

345
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.640
and you cannot choose for others to
exist in a different way

346
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.960
for all that we choose we owe it to
everyone else to let them choose for

347
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.080
themselves
so be who you are be who you want to be

348
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.500
if you feel like you're too old for that
now or you've made too many choices

349
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.220
pulling you away from what you really
want you're wrong

350
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.500
it's never too early or too late to be
the best version of yourself

351
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.299
because the best version of yourself
isn't living in an alternate universe

352
00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:52.500
they're already a part of you
waiting

353
00:26:52.500 --> 00:27:03.059
for you to choose Joy
