4
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.579

thought I was going to have to go

5
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
make the window bigger there we go all
right

6
00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
where's the other thing
oh these things have so many

7
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660
things

8
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
all these apps they all look the same
in my little app drawer

9
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.560
hi everyone how's everyone doing oh my
fingers are cold

10
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.900
true king of bread tube

11
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560
I'm not allowed to eat bread I don't
know if I'm I'm I don't I don't know if

12
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.680
bread tube wants me I say too many
problematic things

13
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.579
hey everyone uh yeah I meant to say hi
hi everyone

14
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.299
happy Friday how hope everyone had a
wonderful week

15
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.360
am I okay yeah I'm good
um I was just uh

16
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.220
uh we shot a new video yesterday
and then I had to refilm half of it

17
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.200
because the Audio I had I was completely
out of range of the microphone so it

18
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459
just sounded horrible
um so I had to refilm that today

19
00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.500
and then I've been editing a bit and uh
hopefully my plan is to hopefully have

20
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.140
it out for patrons at the beginning of
next week

21
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.599
and fingers crossed live for everyone
else later in the week before the end of

22
00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.580
the month
um because that's when the sponsor needs

23
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.200
it out for so
hopefully uh hopefully YouTube won't

24
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.260
have any fits about it I don't think
they will there's nothing in there

25
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.800
that's
like bad or anything

26
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
there's no curse words well actually
there are a couple of curse words but

27
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.500
oh no

28
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.120
your audio must have sounded like
whatever was delivered to the sound

29
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.800
designer for The Last Airbender
oh

30
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.420
it was so bad it was horrible
it sounded like I was in

31
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.060
a tin box and I was using an onboard
microphone instead of a ridiculously

32
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.239
expensive shotgun microphone
in a studio granted my this room where

33
00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.640
I'm like on the computer
has the soundproofing on the walls so

34
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.480
there's not a bunch of

35
00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.580
there's not a bunch of Echoes and stuff
whereas the studio out there uh doesn't

36
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.060
have the soundproofing up
so it still is kind of uh echoey and

37
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.379
I've done my best to fix it but

38
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
you know I'm trying uh for the next
video that comes out which for patrons

39
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.260
will be in July
for everyone else it won't be until the

40
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.739
fall
um we'll have the soundproofing done

41
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.500
properly and uh everything will sound
everything will sound good because it's

42
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.420
a video about good Omens and Sandman so
it has to sound good

43
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.959
good

44
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.500
oh
that's a weird taste

45
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.400
give us the potato quality audio

46
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.900
my my early videos kind of have potato
quality audio if you go back to them

47
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.220
we will always support you keep up the
good work oh thank you Sophia

48
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
you may be addicted to the summer Hikaru
died good I'm glad I'm not the only one

49
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.560
I'm my only frustration is that there's
not more of it

50
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.400
because I want more of it lots more

51
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.800
need to be diving deep into it

52
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
I still haven't seen across the spider
verse no

53
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.740
um Nick and I were gonna go see it
earlier this week

54
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.840
um
but then we had to

55
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.500
we didn't we hadn't quite
done the math on when the video needed

56
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.419
to be finished by and when it needs to
be finished by versus when it needs to

57
00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.860
be viewed by the sponsor and approved by
the sponsor and how much time they have

58
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.780
to view and review it
um and then we don't really want it

59
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.380
going out on the last day of June
because that's the Friday beginning of

60
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.940
the extra long weekend so that would
just be hell the views would be so

61
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.479
I'm trying to get it out for Wednesday
my hope is to get it out publicly on

62
00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.600
YouTube on Wednesday That's My Hope um
but because of that we didn't have time

63
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.320
to go see the movie

64
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.479
drinking anything nice it's uh it's a
drink from Wendy's because I ordered

65
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.900
Wendy's for dinner which I have in front
of me I'm I will be eating so I

66
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.560
apologize for that uh because I haven't
eaten all day and I'm starving

67
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.699
um
but uh it is blueberry pomegranate

68
00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.160
lemonade which has a very it's very it
doesn't taste like blueberry or prom

69
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.479
blueberry or pomegranate or lemonade
it has a really weird taste I don't

70
00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.380
dislike it though
my friend just broke up with my

71
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.060
boyfriend for me like what the
I gave you no permission to break up

72
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.220
with him but that's weird
hi

73
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.319
uh that doesn't sound like a friend

74
00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.400
watched Hannibal because of your toxic
Love video and now I'm traumatized I'll

75
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.180
send you the therapy
[Laughter]

76
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.460
I'm sorry
no need to send me the therapy Bill I'm

77
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.259
sure Hannibal would do therapy for free
have you seen velvet gold mine if you

78
00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.580
have I have I I have seen velvet gold
mine but I saw it like around the time

79
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.380
it came out so it was a long time ago uh
I haven't seen it since I remember

80
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.560
liking it
but uh

81
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.039
but
so I can't I can't really give you like

82
00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.800
a distinct thought on it other than I
did like it

83
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.919
did you hear about the news around
across the spider-verse I don't think so

84
00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:37.560
Maybe
I might have

85
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.180
do you see that Luke McFarland is an
actual daddy now I did

86
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.240
um

87
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.979
which my old school conservative brain
was immediately confused by because I

88
00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:54.180
think he's single
and so I was like single and apparent

89
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.440
how do you do that that's not proper
because

90
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.900
I'm apparently a woman in the 50s
apparently across the spider verse has

91
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.479
controversial trans rap I guess Miles
Morales couldn't be bi but they didn't

92
00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:13.620
say anything about Gwen I'm very curious
to watch it soon I have heard about the

93
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.599
Gwen stuff
um

94
00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:22.919
uh I have heard about that I didn't know
that was controversial though I had has

95
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.240
that made its way to straight Twitter

96
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.840
didn't like Hannibal but a very excited
and optimistic about Brian Fuller's

97
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.279
upcoming Camp Crystal Lake Show I'm
really excited for that I I want to see

98
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.959
him like
I was going to say legitimize the

99
00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:47.060
slasher genre just sort of like
take the slasher genre and like

100
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.300
really increase the the quality of it

101
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.680
uh van twinblade Gwen is controversial
because there is now the Assumption

102
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.800
going around that Gwen is actually trans
um which I love for her

103
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.339
um
and so I guess some some conservatives

104
00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:15.779
have discovered the little hints that
are in the movie uh like I think she has

105
00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:21.120
a pride flag or a pride pin something
like that or uh uh trans pride flag or

106
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.580
pin
um

107
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.720
I can't remember exactly what it is
um

108
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.519
so yeah people are just douchebags

109
00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:37.519
also I have a phobia of cannibalism but
still laughed at the bottom

110
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.560
phobia of cannibalism is pretty
understandable

111
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.040
this

112
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.800
two seconds of a protect trans kids
poster has people in a tailspin I think

113
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.180
she also has a pin on a bag or something
like that or maybe miles has a pin no I

114
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.480
think Miles has a pride flag I have to
see the movie I really need to go see

115
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.320
the movie I did get my Barbie tickets
though as soon as they went on sale I

116
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.200
got my Barbie tick
foreign

117
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.480
also had a trans flag on his UniFi oh oh

118
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.779
that would be pretty badass trans
representation honestly

119
00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:22.880
making Spider Gwen trans that'd be
pretty cool

120
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:31.980
who are your favorite
characters from good Omens and Sandman

121
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.240
um good Omens I bet I've
azira fell in Crowley I just

122
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.800
I obvi that's so basic but it's true I
love the both of them uh and my favorite

123
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.040
character from Sandman is actually
um Joanna Constantine I loved her

124
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.440
I would like her to have her own show
please and thank you

125
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.459
Crowley is hot not gonna lie well that's
because

126
00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.640
oh my God
David Tennant that's because David

127
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.300
Tennant is hot

128
00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:11.399
I'm doing good
Sev sevnarsk

129
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:14.240
that was hard to say

130
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.100
I too love Hannibal but on the Gory
the Gory and goringness scale I think it

131
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.399
wasn't gory enough but then again I was
raised in all School horror movies

132
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:34.800
including 80s horror
TV show so I I think they went as as

133
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.240
gory as possible as they could manage on
a network TV show

134
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.079
um
but I would love to see it come back for

135
00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:46.320
a fourth season on Netflix or something
like that where they can just like go

136
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.640
balls to the wall with it

137
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.300
first season was the Glorious Day
I think you're right I think the first

138
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:07.200
season was the Glorious
I just remember the like totem of bodies

139
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.579
that was probably the first season I
think and then the other one that really

140
00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:15.720
sticks out with me is the gut the
episode where the guy

141
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.200
um
kind of had this thing where he thought

142
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.779
he was a beast
and then will kills him and he and he

143
00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:30.540
and uh
he and Hannibal or maybe it was just him

144
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.880
messed up his body to like give him a
beast form in death or something like

145
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.220
that like I thought that was really cool

146
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.200
what's going on I spent my mid-summer's
Eve watching the Eurovision song contest

147
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.800
from
four I was about to say is that on again

148
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.959
I'm surprised Hannibal went so hard on
network TV I know like I'm really

149
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:05.779
surprised it got away with it like
honestly

150
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.579
where can folks watch Eurovision I do
not know

151
00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:15.899
I'm gonna I'm gonna eat my food before
it gets cold because I ordered it and it

152
00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:19.200
was like it'll be here at 6 30 and I was
like awesome that'll give me a half hour

153
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.360
to eat before the Stream
it got here at 6 50. which barely gave

154
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.720
me enough time to get back upstairs and
sat down and everything and so yeah

155
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.940
eating
deal with it

156
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:49.760
okay so they're starting to be a spicy
Burger

157
00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.300
masala excuse me
Chucky isn't

158
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.079
Chucky's not on network TV though
Chucky's on cable you can get away with

159
00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:06.680
more on cable

160
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.860
the more this channel talks about that
talks about Hannibal the more I want to

161
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.100
watch it I want to do another Hannibal
video I don't know how though don't know

162
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.579
what to talk about

163
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.459
mukbang
if I hate headcanon Lecter as CIS hat

164
00:14:32.459 --> 00:14:38.839
does that get me back
on Twitter probably

165
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.139
UK is excited for the MLB All-Star Game
[Laughter]

166
00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:56.339
what will you be covering for October
um we will in October we will be

167
00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:01.980
releasing a video exploring the
queerness of vampires

168
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.699
um so we're going to talk about like
obviously a lot of stuff in there uh

169
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:11.220
including like what we do in the shadows
and how Dracula is just kind of an

170
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.360
inherently queer character Etc
um

171
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.860
and there's another video in October
that we decided on I can't remember what

172
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.459
it is

173
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.100
I think in October the Sandman video
Sandman and good Omens is going to be

174
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.720
going public on YouTube I think

175
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.339
if I remember correctly I might be wrong

176
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.860
would you ever do anything on Virginia
Woolf

177
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.560
um maybe
at some point possibly uh it's hard to

178
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.800
for me to make videos about books
because there's no visual component to

179
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.920
it
um

180
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.940
and I feel like if it's just me sitting
there that's not interesting it's just

181
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.959
sitting there talking
um

182
00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:10.380
but I know that like there are there
have been adaptations of her stuff so

183
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.839
you know like Orlando and
um stuff like that so I'm it's a

184
00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:19.320
possibility
and what will you be covering on the

185
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.579
first episode of going in raw the first
episode of going in raw we're going to

186
00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:26.699
be talking about Hamilton and the
producers

187
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:30.500
so that's going to be interesting

188
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.720
do people know if our flag means death
is getting another run this year it

189
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.500
should be they finished filming us it's
done

190
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.620
I don't know when it's being released
though

191
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.560
I'd appreciate another Hannibal video
because I don't think I understand the

192
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.399
show I'm a horror person but I don't
really get what the show is doing I see

193
00:16:56.399 --> 00:17:01.199
sort of police procedural
and that people really want will and

194
00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:04.740
Hannibal together Beyond queer
representation I don't see it really I

195
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.959
love the show absolutely loved it

196
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.880
nope I have not seen Hamilton I know
nothing about Hamilton except

197
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.520
King George is a white guy and
something about one shot that's

198
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.559
literally all I know about Hamilton
um

199
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:30.120
and I haven't seen the producers since
2005. so that kind of counts as

200
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.540
something I haven't seen before so it's
going to be kind of comparing and

201
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.640
contrasting
um

202
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.020
for the producers movie which was like
you know

203
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.660
almost a direct adaptation of the play
but in movie form and then the Hamilton

204
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.020
live shot or the Hamilton Pro Shot on
Netflix

205
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:58.140
um
but

206
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.140
like which one it's gonna be it's gonna
be interesting

207
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.600
King George is Leah Michelle's gay
boyfriend

208
00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:15.500
King George is my gay boyfriend Jonathan
Groff should be my gay boyfriend

209
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.660
I was wondering if you would make a
video in The Picture of Dorian Gray I

210
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.440
have read it
um Picture of Dorian Gray I think we

211
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.240
I actually I've talked about Picture of
Dorian Gray actually

212
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.640
in I want to say monsters in the closet
I talked about it

213
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.580
I think it was monsters in the closet
that I talked about a picture of Dorian

214
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.980
Gray
um

215
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.220
it's only I only talk about it for like
five or six minutes but it's in there

216
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.980
whenever I think Hamilton I always think
of the got milk commercial

217
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.880
are you interested in that new Stephen
King Boogeyman movie I don't think I've

218
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.120
heard of it I've been so detached from
everything

219
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.059
um because I've been so busy with the
move and then getting this new video

220
00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:17.940
done and which this video is when on the
longer side so it's been

221
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.100
it's been
it's been a time

222
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.220
my friend and I have watched your
Hannibal video twice bro oh thank you

223
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.160
so glad to be at a place where I can
support patreon now especially during

224
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.140
Pride oh thank you Aaron

225
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.940
I'm hoping that with the new podcast and
with the patron videos coming out

226
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.100
several months ahead of YouTube that
it'll I can hopefully make it worth

227
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.179
being a patron

228
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.880
am I bleeding

229
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:02.640
James did you see looking with Jonathan
Groff and Russell Toby I watched the

230
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.220
first season but I found it so boring I
couldn't watch the rest of it

231
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.539
terrifier 3 is coming out at the end of
2024 and I'm so excited for it terrifier

232
00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:15.720
one and two are some of my favorite
movies I'm gonna make my bestie watch it

233
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.700
with me terrifier one and two are kind
of amazing and terrifier one in

234
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:26.760
particular was made for like no money
but made quite a tidy profit which gives

235
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.780
me hope for Telos

236
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.900
have you talked about episode three
I talked about episode three of The Last

237
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.059
of Us in
merch something whatever The Last of Us

238
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:44.960
was still on TV

239
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.559
I haven't done a video about it
um

240
00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:54.720
but uh we are going to be working on a
video soon that is going to talk about

241
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.820
the last of us so it will be included
there

242
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:05.299
oh I have seen the original uh producers
I

243
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.679
it's very much of its time

244
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.960
Hamilton was a juggernaut but some of
the stuff that came out of it around is

245
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.980
incredible the Hamilton mixtapes for
example check out immigrants we get the

246
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.400
job done

247
00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:27.860
I literally knowing that like nothing
about Hamilton

248
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.360
that one I'm going in completely fresh
I just watched the original producer for

249
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.720
the first time a few weeks ago
I have a few friends who have patreon

250
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.900
accounts and according to them it's more
about giving people an excuse to support

251
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.679
what you're already doing and support
you as a person but obviously that's

252
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:48.059
just one take well I mean I've sadly
haven't been doing a whole lot for the

253
00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:54.960
patreon and we have over 3 000 patrons
um which I am very very thankful for

254
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.980
um
so I'm just hoping that doing this

255
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.960
little extra
um some extra stuff can get people to

256
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.900
jump on board because they're gonna
they're gonna get some extra stuff

257
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.039
they're gonna get some fun stuff

258
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.419
excuse me
I want to see that guy that plays Earth

259
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:20.640
the clown as the Joker he just says the
look and the mannerisms to bring a comic

260
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.780
faithful version to life

261
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.700
um I have not made any movies about or
any videos about gay French movies I

262
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.659
only recently started watching stuff
with subtitles

263
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:39.440
um
so

264
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.700
something like that might be coming in
the future

265
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.620
I like seeing Rambles of thought you
don't get on YouTube on patreon

266
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.840
that's that's what these podcasts are
gonna be

267
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.940
application card the Broadway recording
seems a bit lackluster

268
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.520
it's location car or cast

269
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.600
my stomach is informing me I need to
continue eating

270
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.299
launch munch munch

271
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.280
did you hear about the Wagner group
declaring war against the right did that

272
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.820
actually happen I saw that is it the
Wagner group

273
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.799
is it actually the Wagner group
sorry I saw that randomly on Twitter and

274
00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:11.100
I was like there's been a bunch of like
fake stuff going around

275
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.220
um
all day on Twitter like Jeremy Renner

276
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.039
dying and stuff Jeremy Renner hasn't
died but that was on Twitter so I

277
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:22.400
thought people were just making up
did the Vlog is RIT

278
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.360
because if that's true
private military company partner group

279
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.720
are apparently declaring war on the
Russian Ministry of Defense they say

280
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.799
that there was a Russian rocket strike
on Wagner's Mercenaries

281
00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:42.620
yeah
well then

282
00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:50.340
very interesting very interesting Russia
isn't Russia if there's not a revolution

283
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.140
this is very very interesting

284
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.480
I'm sure
um

285
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.460
I'm I'm sure that there are a lot of
people in in Europe that are very

286
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.280
uh happy about this development

287
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.720
foreign

288
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.820
[Music]
bendelson

289
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.760
have you any interest in Magic the
Gathering I'm currently building a

290
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.299
Sauron Mordor Deck with the new Lord of
the Rings set I love Magic the Gathering

291
00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:38.940
I haven't really gotten to play it with
anyone but Nick though

292
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.840
um
and we haven't played in like a year I I

293
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:49.919
literally have well it's between me and
Nick we have a giant like gym bag filled

294
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:53.400
with cards
um

295
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.679
I actually have five decks in a
container somewhere

296
00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:03.120
close to me in the room I think
um

297
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.900
and uh
so yeah I really love Magic the

298
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.120
Gathering but I don't really get to play
much and I've probably forgotten how to

299
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.260
play to be honest but I keep buying new
cards because I'm like oh this deck

300
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.799
looks really cool and so like I buy new
ones I haven't seen any of the Lord of

301
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:23.400
the Rings ones in store though in stores
yet though but I do I do want to get

302
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.559
them because you know Lord of the Rings
nerd and whatnot

303
00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:35.400
James have you seen secret Invasion yet
what are your thoughts on the fridging

304
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.159
Trope
um I haven't seen it because apparently

305
00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:43.679
it's horrible like every review I have
read of secret invasions first episode

306
00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:50.220
is like this show is sucky and I am not
supporting it because the opening

307
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.960
credits used AI art for its opening
credits which is just disgusting coming

308
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.980
from a company like Marvel

309
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.559
out of the movies which is your favorite
Lord of the Rings

310
00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:07.460
uh

311
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.299
uh

312
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:17.039
it's a close tie between fellowship and
Return of the King because Return of the

313
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:21.600
King has you know the big climate Return
of the King makes me cry every time I

314
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.860
watch it Return of the King makes me cry
but I think Fellowship works better as a

315
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.520
movie
um like it has a very it has a good

316
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.179
structure beginning middle end that that
kind of stuff like Fellowship works

317
00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:38.039
really really well as a movie
um I think Return of the King

318
00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:43.440
works perfectly as the end of the
trilogy but I don't think it works as a

319
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.539
movie all by itself whereas I think what
Fellowship does

320
00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:52.919
I own I think I own four or five
versions of The Lord of the Rings movies

321
00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:57.419
now I own it on DVD
IO I own the normal DVDs I own the

322
00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:03.779
extended edition DVDs I own the extended
edition extended edition Blu-ray set I

323
00:28:03.779 --> 00:28:07.740
own the extended edition
4K set

324
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.419
okay so I own four versions of it

325
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.820
two Tower I I mean I love all three of
them two towers was the first one I saw

326
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.640
in theaters I didn't get to see
Fellowship in theaters

327
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.220
um I didn't see Fellowship till came out
on DVD

328
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.860
and uh
but I yeah two towers when Gandalf comes

329
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.760
up over the hill and everything that
like made me well up when I was in

330
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.080
theaters it's kind of amazing

331
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.520
you have it on VHS oh my God

332
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.480
I had gotten I would have had it on VHS
but I had gotten a DVD player for

333
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.659
Christmas like the year before uh Lord
of the Rings came out

334
00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:57.000
have you ever watched brain dead AKA
Dead Alive I have I've seen all of Peter

335
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.240
Jackson's movies
um brain Dead's hilarious

336
00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:08.940
are the Lord of the Rings books worth
reading uh I think so they're very

337
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.820
specific kind of read though they're
it's like it's a the Lord of the Rings

338
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.279
books are much more about
the kind of

339
00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:27.000
Topography of Middle Earth than they are
about the story and stuff uh I was just

340
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.600
about to mention that the new audio
versions of Lord of the Rings that you

341
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.460
can get on Audible are read by Andy
Circus and they're actually phenomenal

342
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.260
um I listen to them and they are
they are so good they are wonderful and

343
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.360
then you don't have to read the books
you can listen to them while you do

344
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.779
other stuff

345
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.779
what Jamie you don't like Lord of the
Rings

346
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:04.620
I agree Jen Lovely Bones is way better
than people gave a credit for I think

347
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:10.320
people were expecting like some kind of
Next Level Masterpiece when it came out

348
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.020
um
that it would be like the greatest thing

349
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.260
ever because it's Peter Jackson and it
was like this book that had sold a

350
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.179
kajillion copies out of nowhere
um

351
00:30:20.179 --> 00:30:25.679
and then you know it came out and it was
like really good but it wasn't you know

352
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:29.820
the greatest thing ever made and so
people really kind of were like oh it's

353
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.659
it's a disappointment

354
00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:38.640
still have pre-lucas tampering at Star
Wars movies

355
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.440
free Lucas tampering

356
00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:49.080
I'm still forever mad at myself I didn't
see Fellowship in theaters as a child

357
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.880
because it just looked scary to child me
then I fell in love with some Nazgul and

358
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.840
Arc orc toys at someone's house that's I
that's what happened to me I didn't know

359
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.600
what Lord of the Rings was and then I
was at a store

360
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.600
and I saw a nozgold toy and I was like
that is so cool and I got my mom to buy

361
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.919
it for me and
you know it had like Lord of the Rings

362
00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:13.500
on the back and I was like oh is this
like a new fantasy show or something

363
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.799
like that because I had no idea what
Lord of the Rings was

364
00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:20.880
and then like I went online I was like
oh there's a movie coming out but I

365
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.200
couldn't find anyone how old was I I
think I was 12. when Lord of the Rings

366
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.039
came out no I was about to turn 12 when
it came out as 11.

367
00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:31.740
no I was 12.
um

368
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.880
and so I didn't have anyone to go see it
with because none of my friends were

369
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.679
interested in it but by the time two
towers came out I had met some nerds and

370
00:31:40.679 --> 00:31:46.020
got to go see it in theaters and
eventually I saw the extended version of

371
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.220
all of them in theaters in this like
marathon thing while I was in film

372
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.460
School

373
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.980
I remember watching the original
animated Lord of the Rings movie on VHS

374
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.980
I think my copy went missing when I
moved though

375
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.779
honestly the original and the the
animated Lord of the Rings the the

376
00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:11.580
nozzle in that are I find them even to
this day scary

377
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:17.340
like very few things scare me I'm a
horror movie guy those Nas ghoul scared

378
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.659
the out of me when I was a kid the
live-action ones no they're just you

379
00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:27.500
know dudes and cloaks the animated ones
scared the out of me

380
00:32:30.899 --> 00:32:34.980
have any advice on how to write essays
for a YouTube video

381
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.659
uh really just write an essay
um

382
00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:44.159
but when you're writing it think of
things visually

383
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:48.600
um that's what uh Nick and I try and do
because Nick does most of the writing

384
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.000
and then I come in and kind of
I I write stuff that has to do with like

385
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.020
specifically like we're going to talk
about this piece of media and then Nick

386
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.020
does all of the stuff that talks about
society and stuff so Nick writes the

387
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.320
majority of it
um

388
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.440
but trying to think visually while
you're writing it I think that that

389
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.279
helps a lot
the full extent of my Lord of the Rings

390
00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:15.659
experience is a hazy memory of the
glowing white lady that may only be

391
00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:20.960
because of the McDonald's there was a
Lord of the Rings McDonald's toys

392
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.700
no that I have my Lord of the Rings
action figures packed up I need to get

393
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.480
them out on a Shelf

394
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.860
Nick does have much to say about Society

395
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.059
I saw the extended version of Fellowship
first and promptly died that I would

396
00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:45.980
have to wait so long for The Two Towers

397
00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:55.140
the the Lord of the Rings extended
edition uh special features the behind

398
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.320
the scenes stuff that was film school
before I went to film School

399
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.120
that like every time somebody asks me
like should I go to film School

400
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.339
I'm like no do two things look up all
the technical stuff and YouTube videos

401
00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:11.700
because there are lots of YouTube
channels that will tell you all the

402
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.580
technical stuff about filmmaking that
you need to know and as far as the

403
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.419
artistic style stuff of filmmaking watch
the behind the scenes of Lord of the

404
00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:21.839
Rings and listen to the audio
commentaries you will have had a better

405
00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:27.080
Film School experience than anyone who
paid 100 Grand to go to film School

406
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.240
I liked King Kong actually I think it's
too long I think I would cut about a

407
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.179
half hour out of it
um

408
00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:40.679
and it's way too long when he did his
extended edition version of it but the

409
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:44.460
original release if if a half hour had
been cut out of that I think it would

410
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.820
have been perfect

411
00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:51.659
Hobbit movies uh I still haven't seen
the third one

412
00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.200
I liked the second one better than the
first one

413
00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.960
I saw the first one in theaters uh in
the 48 frames per second and I was like

414
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.339
I don't understand why they needed to do
this

415
00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:08.580
um
and I didn't see the second one in

416
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.680
theaters because
when it came out

417
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:20.220
I was moving home uh after business
school because stuff had gone tits up

418
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:25.140
and I'd lost my job and stuff and uh
so I hadn't seen this I didn't see the

419
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.079
second one in theaters but I did buy the
Blu-ray of it and I watched it there but

420
00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:31.740
I've never watched the third one because
I just had no interest in it The Hobbit

421
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.500
was supposed to be two movies it was not
supposed to be three movies Warner

422
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.260
Brothers forced it into three movies so
that they could make more money because

423
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.880
they had to share Revenue with a bunch
of other places and yeah there's a

424
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.260
there's a whole series of Lindsay Ellis
videos about the drama of that

425
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.640
and fellowship came out I was very small
I saw the extended edition DVDs that my

426
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.339
mom had and now I have and I asked my
mom

427
00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:02.180
what they were about

428
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.140
very reassuring I want to make my own
music videos and know I'm going to be

429
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.980
learning a lot in the process because
I've only been on a film set a few times

430
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.940
the fact that you've been on a film set
at all

431
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.200
um puts you kind of Head and Shoulders
above

432
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.520
a lot of people

433
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.040
The Hobbit movies aren't great but
Martin Freeman is Bilbo

434
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.220
though he's just relatable to me as
always Martin Freeman is Bill he was

435
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.540
perfect perfect casting for Bilbo
perfect so was uh Benedict cumberbatch's

436
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.339
smogs he did a phenomenal job of smog
um

437
00:36:41.339 --> 00:36:45.540
oh shoot what's damn I can't remember
his name

438
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.800
um
friend will is the third oh I can't

439
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.220
remember his name
oh he's an actor he he's he's an actor

440
00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:03.480
uh he's the king of the uh elves not not
elrond the other one

441
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.640
um Lee Pace thank you
uh he also did a phenomenal job

442
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.320
um but
the rest of it like

443
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.359
didn't and all the dwarves all the
dwarves did fantastic jobs all of them

444
00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:23.700
even Philly and Kelly
um all of them did a great job

445
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.940
um
but uh

446
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.940
there was just so much extra I put into
that that didn't need to be there

447
00:37:32.339 --> 00:37:38.339
foreign I will forever feel bad for
Christopher Lee for how Done Dirty he

448
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:43.140
was by that whole series cutting him out
of Return of the King and all just all

449
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.440
of that

450
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.500
yes even feeling Keely dwarves aren't
supposed to look like that

451
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:58.859
as the many problems I have with uh with
the rings of power the dwarves look like

452
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:02.820
dwarves
Troye Sivan would have actually made a

453
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.480
really good elf

454
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.500
he's got that face

455
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:30.740
I forgot he played Ronan the Accuser

456
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.820
no Troy was older than that Troy's
around my age I think

457
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.420
ish

458
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.960
I caught him up at Lord of the Rings huh

459
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:59.300
Del Toro would I I wish Del Toro had
gotten to do The Hobbit

460
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.820
King thrower was perfectly Dwarven and
Ballin

461
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.160
worked but the others were too human
yeah

462
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.240
it's Brokeback Mountain well liked by
the gays some of them not by me I hate

463
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.640
it
Troy's 28. it's kind of my age he's six

464
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.740
years six years younger than me
wait six years

465
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.820
I forget how old I am

466
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.420
I think I'm 34.

467
00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:45.740
we'll see where I'll stop aging at 28.

468
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.359
someone asked a bit ago have you seen
the new Netflix one piece trailer uh no

469
00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:54.660
because I don't feel like there's any
point in watching it because Netflix is

470
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.680
not going to
um keep renewing it long enough to tell

471
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.780
the whole story because I don't even
think that the whole story is told

472
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.400
finished in the manga yet so
I think it's completely useless to watch

473
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.940
that thing because they're not going to
do it they're going to cancel it after a

474
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.740
couple of at best it might get four
seasons and that's if it does really

475
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.220
really really really really well
um

476
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.640
and Netflix doesn't have a great track
record when it comes to anime

477
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.060
adaptations so it's probably not going
to do well at all

478
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.260
what would you do if a right-wing gay
comparing what would you do if a

479
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.760
right-wing gay comparing other
right-wing or communist countries that

480
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.660
are more worse than their own country
while defending the right

481
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.260
sorry Michael I'm not I'm not

482
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.760
sure what you mean

483
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.800
del Toro's Hobbit survived in the scenes
before the Shire was left incidentally

484
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.900
the only good stuff from the first
Hobbit movie

485
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.579
most people think one or two seasons but
it looks okay and it might get more

486
00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:06.079
people into the anime or Manga

487
00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:08.940
I mean I mean I might watch it I don't
know

488
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.060
um

489
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:20.040
probably not though because at 10 000
patrons we're gonna do our one piece

490
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.579
video but that's gonna be I'm gonna
watch the anime Nick's gonna read the

491
00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:27.900
Manga and then we're gonna come together
and do it but we need to we need about 6

492
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.400
000 more patrons before we do that

493
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.160
yes

494
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.160
have you seen the photos of the new Last
Airbender costumes they look like great

495
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.320
cosplay but I still do not want I think
they look fantastic actually like in my

496
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.820
opinion I think they look great
um I'm really excited for the Avatar

497
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.820
live action show
um

498
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.859
well I'm as excited for a live action
adaptation of something as I've ever

499
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:12.420
been I guess which is not all that
excited

500
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.480
um

501
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.099
I love thank you uh for the Super Chat
Jen I'd love if Del Toro did an

502
00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:26.339
adaptation to Peter S beagles The Last
Unicorn I I would go out on streets and

503
00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:30.780
beg for money to get him the money to
make The Last Unicorn a live-action Last

504
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.820
Unicorn that would be
or or even stop motion like with

505
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:40.320
Pinocchio
that would be oh my God I want to see

506
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.760
his I want to see his Last Unicorn that
would be amazing

507
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:50.640
oh just he would do I want to see what
he would do with the harpy like

508
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.060
just create a whole new generation of
nightmares

509
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:06.180
how many patrons to get you to watch One
Piece live action not even to do a video

510
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.280
just to watch it uh four thousand if we
hit four thousand patrons I'll watch the

511
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:17.339
live action one piece
we're only like 200 or 300 away from

512
00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:20.700
that so
that's not too much it's not too big an

513
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.940
ask

514
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.119
agree the live action adaptations are
just unnecessary most of the time I hope

515
00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:34.200
the new Avatar isn't terrible yeah like
I I sometimes I like live action like

516
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.660
have I ever liked a live-action
adaptation of a cartoon

517
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.940
I don't think I have actually
now that I think of it

518
00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:53.180
remember the gay Pinocchio I want to see

519
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.300
I was reminded of gay Pinocchio the
other night when I was watching a

520
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.200
wrestling video it was a wrestling
YouTuber

521
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.680
um and he was talking about something
and in came a clip of that

522
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.880
Pinocchio movie

523
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.839
I've actually never seen Speed Racer
I hear it's really good but I've never

524
00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:18.500
actually seen it

525
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.040
Scott Pilgrim Vs the World wasn't uh
adapting a cartoon though it was

526
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.260
adapting
um a comic book

527
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:40.800
laughs
is it still worth watching avatar The

528
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.760
Last Airbender now I think I I think
it's a really good show

529
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.660
I think it and I think it's aged well
um

530
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.680
I think there's some incredible
characters on that show it really opened

531
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.359
my eyes to like that and some anime that
I watched really opened my eyes to the

532
00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:02.700
fact that animated things can
actually be really good and not just for

533
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.940
kids

534
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.339
or the Scooby-Doo movies yeah the
Scooby-Doo movies worked you're right

535
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.880
you're right

536
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:55.740
I agree Winters I they need to get to
Cora

537
00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.240
make Cora properly queer
and um

538
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.220
also Mako and orbolin

539
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.819
is the gay Pinocchio movie the best Rush
was that Russian uh no it is definitely

540
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:21.619
not the best Russian movie
foreign

541
00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:30.780
oh God the Velma show is horrible
it's so bad

542
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.640
I actually watched that thing

543
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:42.180
just freaking just
brutal

544
00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:56.819
I always prefer animation there's just
so much animation can do that people on

545
00:46:56.819 --> 00:47:00.180
a stage
can't without middling CGI Nick is

546
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:05.000
cursing me somewhere but I prefer
animated Star Wars for example

547
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.859
um
I personally think the original Clone

548
00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:14.460
Wars animated series the original
original one the one that would like had

549
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.780
12 12 minute episodes
might be one of the best things Star

550
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.160
Wars has ever is absolutely one of the
best things Star Wars has ever done

551
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.319
I haven't really liked any of the other
animated stuff though

552
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:39.240
I did watch Q4 so I watched all of it I
loved it I wanted a second season and

553
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.660
but there were so many people who were
just so grumpy

554
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.740
about
gay characters not being these

555
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.819
Paragons of perfection
that it

556
00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:53.660
didn't get one

557
00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:00.660
the best Pinocchio is Lou Wilson in D20
I don't know what that means but thank

558
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.579
you van twinblade for the Super Chat

566
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.200
um but I think I'm done moving for a
while I think I'm

567
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:57.180
not settling but I'm I think I'm done
for a while I'm gonna take a break from

568
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.980
moving every
every year

569
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:07.940
since my YouTube channel took off in
2020 I've moved three times

570
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:15.119
Dimension 20 Dropout DND show used to be
College Humor dm'd by Brennan Lee

571
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.720
Mulligan

572
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.220
warlock Pinocchio

573
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.060
uh no I still haven't watched Andor I
actually do want to watch Andor though

574
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.240
like I've completely lost interest in
basically everything Star Wars but I do

575
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.800
really want to watch Andor
um I just haven't gotten a chance to sit

576
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.940
down and do it yet because I'm so
freaking busy with like the last couple

577
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.540
of months there were so many videos this
month there's only two videos which is

578
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:50.400
certainly
um reflected in the uh AdSense Revenue

579
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.079
um
and uh

580
00:49:55.079 --> 00:50:00.119
but so we were so busy with videos and
then with moving and just like chaos and

581
00:50:00.119 --> 00:50:04.140
everything so uh during the summer I'm
gonna check out

582
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.780
and or and a couple other things I need
to finish watching camp Camp

583
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.440
um what else is there I have to watch
because there's a couple of movies well

584
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.800
there's a bunch of movies coming out
this summer I want to watch

585
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.280
um there's some books I need to read
there's a there's a lot I got to do this

586
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.780
summer
I have fig I have somehow put off all of

587
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.680
the stuff I do for fun
so long

588
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:34.640
that I will be making it a job
to do during the summer

589
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.520
uh no further into camp Camp than I was
last time

590
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.300
um
uh Nick and I are gonna get into it

591
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:53.460
probably next week I think because I
think next week Nick will be kind of

592
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.319
settled into his place and I'm
relatively settled here a little bit of

593
00:50:58.319 --> 00:51:03.780
stuff that needs to be done but not
um not anything crazy and so we'll

594
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.160
actually be able to sit down and watch
something

595
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:14.760
uh no I have not watched uh Kenobi
I haven't watched anything stood I

596
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.839
haven't watched anything of Star Wars
since

597
00:51:18.839 --> 00:51:23.700
episode nine
really gave up on Star Wars after

598
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.300
episode nine

599
00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:30.720
uh yeah Heart Stopper season two I'm
actually gonna do a live stream uh watch

600
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:37.400
along with the patrons on the patreon
Discord for uh Heart Stopper too

601
00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.619
would you say you're a workaholic or is
it out of need

602
00:51:45.619 --> 00:51:51.540
uh more so need I think
um

603
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.619
you know the more usually the more
videos we put out the more money comes

604
00:51:55.619 --> 00:52:00.839
in and you know money is
needed for

605
00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:05.359
food and stuff
um

606
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.240
but uh

607
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.740
that's why like I'm actually taking the
summer well I'm not even taking the

608
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.880
summer off I'm taking the summer off uh

least one video a month for patrons so

610
00:52:29.819 --> 00:52:34.859
have you ever watched any anime anime by
Satoshi Khan I don't think so I've never

611
00:52:34.859 --> 00:52:38.420
heard that name before so I don't think
I have

612
00:52:59.099 --> 00:53:01.700
hmm

613
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.540

616
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.059
many podcasts people usually listen to

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.099
um for half of the video I'm actually
not wearing a turtleneck which is rare

623
00:54:14.099 --> 00:54:17.240

uh this one this isn't another pimple
this is the same pimple that's been

627
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.859
there for the last month

628
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:05.339
Black Swan was based on anime it wasn't
based on an anime

629
00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:11.460
it was heavily inspired by one
though uh Darren Aronofsky did not

630
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.480
admit to that

631
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.420
but if you uh

632
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:25.740
if you watch perfect blue and then you
watch Black Swan afterwards you're like

633
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.280

Rachel Maddow podcast that she does

643
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.020
they're really good
um

644
00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:23.960
what else is here

645
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.119
I don't listen to it enough but I weigh
with Jamila Jamil is also a really good

646
00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:38.280
podcast and a history of the 90s I I end
up I don't listen to history of the 90s

647
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.480
on a regular basis but I end up binging
them every time every couple of uh

648
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.559
every couple of months

649
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:58.280
where a lot of turtlenecks this fall in
the winter and felt very handsome

650
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:04.440
on Satoshi Khan's blog he said he and
Aronofsky did meet in Japan one time

651
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:10.020
yeah apparently they did meet but when
asked about it Aronofsky said they

652
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.200
didn't
um and he was like I don't know who they

653
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.839
are I've never heard of that person what
are you talking about

654
00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:20.819
and then you find out oh
I don't know why he just didn't say that

655
00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:25.520
yes there's an influence and give credit
I don't ugh

656
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:33.920
Americans hate giving credit to
non-americans seriously

657
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:48.059
has anyone else read Satoshi Khan's
Death Letter goodbye

658
00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:51.079
I have not

659
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.599
I am attempting to avoid depressing
stuff

660
00:57:57.599 --> 00:58:01.920
had this question in my mind for a while
if I a gay man date a non-binary person

661
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.339
who presents themselves in a more
masculine way should I consider myself

662
00:58:05.339 --> 00:58:09.480
pan or bi that is a really good question
because like

663
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:15.059
I I find lots of non-binary people
attractive and like with masculine

664
00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:19.559
presentation
and but at the same time I find lots of

665
00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:24.059
CIS guys with very feminine
presentations very attractive

666
00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:28.200
um
so I think it's really like how what do

667
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.200
you feel
like I don't think someone else should

668
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.740
say Well you're dating someone who's
non-binary so you can't be gay

669
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.280
because I think that's like I'm
very much

670
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:43.740
died in the world gay gay gay gay gay
gay I've been gay since birth

671
00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.280
um
but that doesn't mean that I would be

672
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:57.359
like ew you're non-binary growth go away
like that why I wouldn't date a girl

673
00:58:57.359 --> 00:59:00.260
but like

674
00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:06.059
why not date non-binary person
I don't think that makes you straight or

675
00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:12.319
pan or buy or pan or anything like that
foreign

676
00:59:16.339 --> 00:59:22.099
admits that a lot of his movies are
inspired by anime yeah yeah

677
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.920
check your DMs on Discord I don't know
if I have Discord

678
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.579
installed on here anymore

679
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.500
no it's not born

680
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.200
oh my God this looks amazing hahaha

681
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.540
James what would a deltoro porn look
like

682
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.980
I don't know
it would either be really

683
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.040
um

684
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:21.980
I feel like it would be like the
porn version of tantric sex

685
01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:28.319
if that makes any sense
def definitely monster

686
01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:30.980
absolutely

687
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:46.640
that'd be cool then Twin Blade I don't
know if um

688
01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:52.040
I don't know what Saturday I know
tomorrow's not the 28th

689
01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:55.700
next Saturday

690
01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:02.900
I don't know what my Saturdays look like
for the foreseeable future

691
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.720
I'll have to check it out but that might
be fun

692
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.140
I'd really love to see

693
01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:44.040
oh I just hurt my toe I'd really love to
see Guillermo del Toro do like an attack

694
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.059
on Titan thing
I think that could I think that would I

695
01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:53.720
think he would make it like really
exciting and unsettling at the same time

696
01:02:56.819 --> 01:03:01.440
seen trance I have not seen Transformers
porn I have not

697
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.400
foreign

698
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:11.660
I'm not surprised that it exists but I
have not seen it

699
01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:48.839
I feel terrible every time I miss a
stream I'm so often out to eat when you

700
01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:53.339
do I'm tempted to just bring you up on
my phone shush the entire restaurant

701
01:03:53.339 --> 01:03:56.900
because James is talking

702
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.020
Lilo and Stitch actually uh I love that
name by the way

703
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:10.740
um
I used to actually post these always for

704
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:16.260
patrons when they were more scheduled
um

705
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:20.819
but I actually am going to go through
and make a playlist and post it for

706
01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:23.280
patrons
um

707
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.000
because sometimes they're just like
really

708
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.660
the the streams are just kind of really
a name but sometimes they're a lot of

709
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:36.000
fun and so during the summer I want to
go through and kind of

710
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.680
curate a playlist of streams that
patrons are actually gonna

711
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.400
so that patrons can still have access to
them instead of hunting down links on my

712
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.260
Twitter from weeks ago and stuff like
that

713
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:55.400
I need to invest in headphones I have
several pairs of headphones

714
01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.420
excuse me

715
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.040
apparently Lindsay Alice's Transformers
inspired book series gets a bit smutty

716
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.420
later I've heard that I've heard that I
Tried reading the I couldn't get through

717
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:21.500
the first book uh so I didn't read the
didn't buy or read the second one

718
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:32.099
live action core aligned would be
horrifying

719
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.839
oh Masala needs headphones

720
01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:41.520
it's like I have like three pairs of
headphones right here

721
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:47.520
I have my
my air pods max headphones I have my

722
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.280
audio mastering headphones which are
currently laying on the floor I have my

723
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.780
my cat ear headphones

724
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.099
in case I ever stream videos again

725
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.339
Stephen King's it as a stop motion with
the adult ears cut

726
01:06:13.339 --> 01:06:19.160
that would be really cool that would be
really really cool

727
01:06:43.079 --> 01:06:45.680
laughs

728
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.660
have you seen the manga anime Bloom into
you it's currently one of my favorite

729
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.140
mangas I've heard of it but I haven't
seen it

730
01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:00.200
I've been recommended it a bunch on um
Amazon

731
01:07:00.359 --> 01:07:05.640
I don't actually think I've ever seen a
Wes Anderson movie

732
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.079
to uh to be honest

733
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.039
have I

734
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:20.460
no I've seen like the trailers for them
and stuff and

735
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:26.520
um I wouldn't say Wes Anderson it was
really kind of my style or my uh

736
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.720
my taste

737
01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:36.119
not a big horror fan but I'm a nerd
that's excited for the

738
01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:41.400
FNAF movie
it was this gay ladrill the ancient elf

739
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.579
Lord

740
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.079
if this is ask James if you've seen this
movie

741
01:07:55.079 --> 01:07:58.020
foreign
James have you seen the point by Harry

742
01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:01.280
Nilsson I have not

743
01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:08.940
considering like I went to film school
and I'm kind of a film snob

744
01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:12.319
a lot of movies I haven't seen

745
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:35.279
did you ever get fleabag in the U.S I
think that that went to Amazon Prime

746
01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.799
maybe
um

747
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:42.660
I haven't watched it though but I we did
get it in the US and Canada I just can't

748
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.460
remember where at

749
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.120
laughs

750
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.500
I think you've earned other Super Chat
Jen

Stardust but I haven't seen the movie

752
01:09:23.219 --> 01:09:27.239

753
01:09:27.239 --> 01:09:32.400
um poll that I sent out to patreon uh
patrons and members uh for the new

754
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:38.100
patreon podcast
um a lot of people voted for Stardust so

755
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:42.560
we are going I will be seeing Stardust
very soon

756
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.060
poke to poke tuber

757
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.380
what's a poke tuber

758
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:34.040
oh a pokeytuber I have watched some of
them actually

759
01:10:39.659 --> 01:10:43.460
oh he is really cute

760
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:49.820
I haven't watched any of his videos
before but yeah he's really cute

761
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.600
there was one I was watching for a while
I can't remember his name now but he was

762
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.620
basically breaking down every episode of
the anime

763
01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:02.460
um
and uh

764
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:09.380
I it was like reliving
all of Pokemon it was great

765
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.420
hey Kiara

766
01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:23.300
yes Ace trainer Liam that's it

767
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.800
yeah that's him

768
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.340
which I I think I randomly clicked on
his one of his videos because I was like

769
01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:01.800
oh he's hot and then just ended up
watching like a hundred videos 100 or

770
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.219
more videos

771
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:14.100
[Laughter]
Stardust is gonna be one of the first uh

772
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.840
movies we cover
the movie that won like by far is

773
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.679
actually Princess Bride
um but

774
01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:26.940
we're we're not putting it off we're
doing we're gonna do that because so

775
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:30.960
many people wanted it we're actually
gonna do that one as like a special

776
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.600
um Christmas episode that's gonna go out
as like an extra long episode because

777
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:41.400
Nick hasn't seen the movie since he was
like a kid and I've never seen the movie

778
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.640
um
so it's good we're gonna do that as like

779
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.520
a special merry Christmas happy Hanukkah
kind of video

780
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.739
maybe we'll have like a Christmas tree
in the background or something

781
01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.860
no I've never seen it all the movies
that ended up in that poll

782
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.699
um are either movies that I've never
seen or that I haven't seen in like at

783
01:13:05.699 --> 01:13:08.480
least 15 years

784
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:31.320
Christmas trees of unusual size
I actually have two Christmas trees uh

785
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.500
obviously both of them are fake one is
you know a normal green Christmas tree

786
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.280
and the other one
is a white Christmas tree with I think

787
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.880
blue lights

788
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:53.239
I haven't seen Princess Bride but I know
Carrie el el west has a sexy mustache

789
01:13:54.659 --> 01:13:59.340
as Batman Returns I wonder oh that might
be fun for like my birthday or something

790
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.679
if I'm friendless and have no one to go
do anything with for my birthday

791
01:14:03.679 --> 01:14:10.280
maybe do like a Batman Returns watch
along on the patron Discord

792
01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.840
because that is
a a Christmas movie I don't care what

793
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.440
anybody says

794
01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:35.280
it's actually weird that I haven't seen
The Princess Bride specifically because

795
01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.860
Andre the Giant is in it and when I was
a kid and had just gotten into wrestling

796
01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:45.239
I watched like every movie that a
wrestler was in

797
01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:50.360
but somehow managed to not watch
Princess Bride

798
01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.480
oh

799
01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.780
I assumed it was a quote

800
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.260
have you seen repo the Genetic Opera if
so what do you think of it and will you

801
01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.100
do a video on it I don't know if I'll do
a video on it I have seen it though I

802
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.820
own it on Blu-ray I watched it came out
when I was in film school and me and a

803
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.780
bunch of friends went to the theater to
see it and um

804
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:30.239
for a bit there it kind of became my
aesthetic in film school

805
01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:34.980
um but I really I mean it's very very
campy like it's it's like

806
01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:40.760
bad slasher movie The Musical but like I
really liked it I I I

807
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.199
it's it's a lot of fun it'll probably
get like mentioned in a movie in a video

808
01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:50.040
at some point but I don't know if like
there'll be a video of that

809
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.820
specifically

810
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.320
princess buttercup
was a general in the first Wonder Woman

811
01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.679
movie

812
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.340
oh is it is that um
Claire Underwood

813
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:23.239
House of Cards
um oh crap I'm blanking on her name now

814
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.580
she was amazing on House of Cards

815
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.520
Robin Wright that's it
foreign

816
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:52.080
book 1994. was was he I I watched that
so often as a kid

817
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:58.260
and I never knew why until I watched it
as again as a teenager and I'm like

818
01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.000
this is a Mowgli that

819
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.719
it's like huh I wonder why I watched
this movie constantly when I was like

820
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:09.440
seven years old

821
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:21.199
oh he was yes he was he was Quincy and
Dracula he was really hot in Dracula

822
01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.120
laughs

823
01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:43.679
have I heard of nimona
yes I think I've I've seen the word

824
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:50.719
on Twitter I've seen people mention it
but I don't actually know what it is

825
01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:56.840
the one I was into

826
01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.500
Brendan Fraser

827
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.280
as a kid
I did not appreciate how hot Brendan

828
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.260
Frazier was
um

829
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:14.400
the two days ago I bought the Mummy
Trilogy on Blu-ray and I'm gonna watch

830
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.440
it because I'm like
Brendan Frazier was actually gorgeous

831
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.420
and it just flew right over my head

832
01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:37.820
or the graphic novel but I'm not super
hyped with trailers I've seen

833
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.860
the Coppola Dracula is my favorite movie
if not Star Wars five

834
01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:49.920
Bram Stoker's Dracula is
phenomenal it is just like an art an art

835
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.560
a director just
jerking off with art it's it's it is an

836
01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:02.659
amazing movie
even even with Keanu Reeves's accent

837
01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:06.719
for what it's worth the cast of The
Mummy is why I thought I was bi for as

838
01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:10.380
long as I did
yeah like like looking at just like I

839
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.100
haven't watched it since but looking at
like the box art and stuff I'm like God

840
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.460
damn

841
01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:28.080
as a kid but I would get Christmas
Christmas flu or spring or summertime

842
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.500
cold I would always pair The Neverending
Story with The Princess Bride for

843
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.600
Comfort lullaby movies
see for me it was The Rescuers Down

844
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.500
Under and Hercules

845
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:51.000
it's sad that I think it was Rachel Vice
was in The Mummy that she didn't come

846
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.260
back for the third one I've never seen
the third one I saw the mummy and The

847
01:19:55.260 --> 01:20:00.380
Mummy 2 uh but I I've never seen the
third one

848
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:10.739
frankiano reads inappropriate casting
how here we weirdly enough like John

849
01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:15.420
Acker in the movie also seemed like he
played him as a relatively Bland guy on

850
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.780
purpose

851
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.620
Rachel Vice is everyone's sexual

852
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:30.440
and Cody is a small child
and Snow White gender gender is weird

853
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.340
and Fraser was so gorgeous Billy
Campbell

854
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:46.800
who played Quincy in Dracula was
every single one of them could step on

855
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.040
me

856
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.100
people seem to either be scared of
Falcor or think he's cute

857
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:16.760
Falcor is the dragon from Neverending
Story right

858
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.159
okay
I've also never seen a never-ending

859
01:21:23.159 --> 01:21:26.239
story FYI

860
01:21:28.679 --> 01:21:33.380
I skipped a lot of 80s movies apparently

861
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:50.060
sentence was weird I think I had two
ideas and how to

862
01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.500
I have only heard the theme song because
of stranger things

863
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:18.179
I haven't I've never seen The Dark
Crystal either

864
01:22:18.179 --> 01:22:24.980
or Labyrinth there's like I skipped so
many 80s movies

865
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.100
female squirrels oh my God not because
of her but that she had the hots for him

866
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.179
and turns out I wanted that

867
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.199
I remember that squirrel

868
01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:47.300
the 80s was the era for Muppet movies I
I've also never seen a Muppet Movie

869
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.440
I haven't even seen them up at the
Christmas carol

870
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.719
the same guy who made the soundtrack for
Never Ending Story also made The

871
01:22:57.719 --> 01:23:04.219
Fantastic soundtrack for dos boot from
the same just aim director really

872
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.880
a lot of people think Winona Ryder is
bad and Bram Stoker's right I don't

873
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.780
think she's bad in Bram Stoker's Dracula
I think she was fantastic in it

874
01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:16.140
she really should have been in The
Godfather Part three but it would have

875
01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.380
been better

876
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.080
geek

877
01:23:26.699 --> 01:23:30.900
it's funny that you skipped the 80s
films and even claimed that there are no

878
01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.340
good 80s films that you haven't seen the
Muppets

879
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.659
yeah I love stranger things which is
it's like there's lots of 80s stuff I

880
01:23:39.659 --> 01:23:44.280
love
um Scarface Predator slasher movies

881
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:49.920
Weird Science
I watched Weird Science so much as a kid

882
01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.780
not just for Wyatt and a
thong

883
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.900
um
but I watched Weird Science a lot as a

884
01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.960
kid

885
01:24:05.159 --> 01:24:10.380
Labyrinth is essentially a David Bowie
musical with scary Muppets

886
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.760
I'm actually surprised nobody's sitting
on the patron thing that nobody

887
01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.659
suggested the Labyrinth Nick mentioned
that last night I was like yeah nobody

888
01:24:18.659 --> 01:24:22.040
nobody mentioned that

889
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:29.420
Wolfgang Peterson directed Das Boot
never-ending story

890
01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.940
way to go
Troy enemy wow

891
01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.679
I did not know that he like I've seen
Das Boot like but I didn't know he did

892
01:24:40.679 --> 01:24:44.100
the rest of them
James so you have to stop and

893
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:48.600
immediately set up a patreon viewing of
Labyrinth David Bowie and Muppets James

894
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.420
that's everything I want a movie besides
violence

895
01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.860
Labyrinth didn't age that well love
Bowie loved the movie as a kid but mine

896
01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:08.000
was by Nostalgia for it ain't strong
never seen Top Gun either

897
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.960
all of the 80s movies that I was
obsessed with were slasher movies

898
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:25.440
slasher movies and Weird Science
I watched a lot of 70s movies though

899
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:32.040
playing none in the 80s I didn't even
watch like Indiana Jones until I was in

900
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.840
I think I had finished Film School
by the time I'd watched Indiana Jones

901
01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:49.739
never really watched any gay or queer
movies maybe because I'd have to watch

902
01:25:49.739 --> 01:25:52.739
movies with my family and that made it
super uncomfortable means I don't know

903
01:25:52.739 --> 01:25:56.400
anything now though
hey these movies were great because

904
01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.320
Hawkeyes and crop tops and short shorts

905
01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:08.900
Dracula Untold is underrated and Luke
Evans is a a robo babe

906
01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.520
we just need a definitive list of movies
James hasn't seen and then we'd never

907
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.300
need a live stream again
shh

908
01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.219
it's a lot of movies I haven't seen

909
01:27:06.239 --> 01:27:09.719
okay but what are your feelings on
Titanic I actually think Titanic's a

910
01:27:09.719 --> 01:27:12.320
phenomenal movie

911
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.960
and the people who say it's a bad movie
are

912
01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.199
just
20 years too late edgelords

913
01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.179
Gen X or I knew claimed that 80s movies
were purposely cheap

914
01:27:33.179 --> 01:27:37.139
but also made to be as broadly appealing
as possible and they said that's how the

915
01:27:37.139 --> 01:27:41.300
token black character got pushed
apparently

916
01:27:43.139 --> 01:27:48.980
80s movies were cheap that's when
budgets started going up

917
01:27:55.139 --> 01:27:58.739
you've seen Citizen Kane though it's
mostly just boring to watch I do

918
01:27:58.739 --> 01:28:03.679
disagree Citizen Kane is not a boring
movie

919
01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:11.760
Citizen Kane is so good like even if
you're just watching it for Orson Welles

920
01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.639
performance it's so good
never mind all the like the filmmaking

921
01:28:17.639 --> 01:28:21.860
techniques that were pioneered there
like it's

922
01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.000
wasn't around during the 80s but they
were

923
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.820
Titanic was actually about the real
people who died I'd be interested

924
01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.300
otherwise well you can't be about the
real people who died because there's too

925
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.980
many of them you'd have to pick certain
people

926
01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:46.800
Titanic got me the girlfriend
Titanic got

927
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.179
my girlfriend liked it
as much treatment and a statement about

928
01:28:51.179 --> 01:28:55.020
its quality but the backlash yeah there
was a huge backlash against Titanic

929
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.679
because people

930
01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:03.960
girls liked it and so people were like
oh this movie's actually bad

931
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.540
no actually it's not

932
01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:18.900
300 satisfied my want for CGI abs for
the next really for the next six

933
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.679
lifetimes

934
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:34.020
I still think I still find it funny that
people are like

935
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:38.460
Zack Snyder is a homophobe and I'm like
have you seen 300

936
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:46.280
he basically made
like 40 million dollar gay porn

937
01:29:52.139 --> 01:29:56.159
I saw Titanic eight times in the theater
when it came out in 97 so I have a bias

938
01:29:56.159 --> 01:30:00.900
I saw it I never saw it in the theater
but I saw it at a drive-in

939
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:04.560
um
and

940
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:11.280
I remember I went with my cousin and her
friend and her friend's nephew and he

941
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.120
when when Kate Winslet was naked he was
going crazy he was like oh my God

942
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.920
boobies and I was how old was I when
that came out nine

943
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:24.120
and so I was like yeah boobies

944
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:38.460
there are a lot of YouTube channels that
just do compilations of AI art generated

945
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:42.420
hot men images boiling the format down
to the essentials

946
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:47.699
laughs to be honest Snyder loves
queer-coated villains and stuff I I love

947
01:30:47.699 --> 01:30:52.580
queer-coded villains I miss queer-coded
villains

948
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.460
like
Disney movies have sucked since they got

949
01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.960
rid of their queer-coded villains

950
01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.480
I like the actor who played the Evil
Suitor in Titanic

951
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.920
fun fact he actually played hedvig in
one of the Productions of Hedwig in the

952
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.400
angry and

953
01:31:30.179 --> 01:31:34.620
foreign
yeah that's his name

954
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.620
being queer-coated villains are
sometimes a problem depending on context

955
01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:42.600
in the context of Snyder's films and the
fear of the other two I I like

956
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.679
queer-coated villains

957
01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:48.860
I used to

958
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:55.520
as a queer-coded villain in training I

959
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.080
think Titanic did everything it could to
appeal to cynical straight men that

960
01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:04.980
on-screen breasts a bunch of dude Bros
getting character Arc listening to an

961
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:11.639
old lady it's not a it's a brat lash I
like that I like that

962
01:32:11.639 --> 01:32:16.080
it absolutely is because for the last
half of the movie it's an action movie

963
01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.840
it's a disaster movie it's like Deep
Rising or or twister or something it's

964
01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:27.600
it's got all of that stuff that all of
the 90s disaster movies had

965
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:33.179
but there was also a romance
and it's like yeah and you know he

966
01:32:33.179 --> 01:32:37.739
pulled it off
never questioned James Cameron

967
01:32:37.739 --> 01:32:43.460
he somehow keeps
managing to do the thing

968
01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:56.719
oh anime is full of queer-coded villains

969
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.679
there's an Australian musician you'd
like

970
01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:19.340
played Hedwig on stage find the video
iota

971
01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:44.420
oh that seems to be coming up is crypto
stuff

972
01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.760
Zack Snyder's Watchman is really really
good I prefer the director's cut over

973
01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.360
the
ultimate or theatrical I think it was

974
01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:58.800
the director's cut that I saw
what do you think of the submarine with

975
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.420
five people
a lot of coverage and immigration dying

976
01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:06.540
immigration dying on a sinking ship gets
no coverage

977
01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:11.100
I
have seen it I've it's it's

978
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.840
I haven't been paying attention to it

979
01:34:16.139 --> 01:34:19.739
I'm at these two Maritime students in
school and asked them why they wanted to

980
01:34:19.739 --> 01:34:22.679
be
Maritime and they paused looked at each

981
01:34:22.679 --> 01:34:28.820
other then at me and said they saw
Titanic as kids and liked the big boat

982
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:38.460
I think a lot of a lot I had so many
Titanic models as a kid Titanic puzzles

983
01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:43.699
I had so much Titanic stuff after that
movie came out

984
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.360
necessarily make them Less Fun and they
can from the claim anyway

985
01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:03.920
but I do look a scance at the way queer
villains are sometimes written

986
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.699
like a favorite 80s movies

987
01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.380
Douglas Adams designed FMV
point-and-click game called Starship

988
01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:23.300
tight I think I played that

989
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.440
I think I might have played that as a
kid

990
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.300
oh God Barefoot Kane oh Jesus

991
01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:16.639
before

992
01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:28.920
when are we going to get an RPG dating
Sim where we date the queer-coded

993
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.659
villain instead of the damsel
I'm sure there's a dating Sim out there

994
01:36:33.659 --> 01:36:36.320
that does that

995
01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:51.840
Christian School is as a kid I remember
on Library day all the kids fought over

996
01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.900
the big Titanic book because they love
the diagrams of the disaster

997
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:11.960
sounds like the air conditioning is
about to turn on

998
01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.659
I haven't played dream daddy but I've
watched people play dream daddy

999
01:37:21.659 --> 01:37:27.420
I'm not good with uh like dating Sims
and stuff like that because I I suck at

1000
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.679
playing anything that's that has a lot
of

1001
01:37:30.679 --> 01:37:34.320
dialogue
so a game that has a lot of reading I'm

1002
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.980
even worse at

1003
01:38:00.659 --> 01:38:04.800
I hear that if you row a boat into any
body of water and poke a hole in the

1004
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:11.159
bottom Leonardo DiCaprio will show up
and draw you naked what

1005
01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:23.460
I so much especially when people be like
a night to remember is better because

1006
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:26.699
the effects are practical and there's no
Romance

1007
01:38:26.699 --> 01:38:31.560
most of the effects in the in the
Titanic in James Cameron is Titanic were

1008
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.860
were practical
good God

1009
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.380
like aren't there three different anime
about a girl

1010
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:49.940
gets to get into her favorite dating Sim
and then dates the villain

1011
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:59.840
how would you adapt Hades game into on
the screen

1012
01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:05.880
oh I don't know I don't know if you
could do it as a movie it would have to

1013
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:11.100
be a show like a limited series I would
go six episodes and at the end of each

1014
01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.440
episode uh zagreus would die and have to
restart over but as he's going through

1015
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.280
the sections of Hell each time different
stuff happens so the the character

1016
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.600
progression
uh keeps going you meet new characters

1017
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.080
because you're meeting new people as he
takes different paths and stuff like

1018
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.280
that through uh through the underworld
um

1019
01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.699
and uh
yeah I think that would be the way to do

1020
01:39:35.699 --> 01:39:39.960
it and then
like

1021
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.000
maybe in like episode three or four he
fights Hades but loses but then actually

1022
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.860
beats him in episode six something like
that

1023
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.580
all thinking they're saving a princess
just to find out the princess ran off on

1024
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:11.600
purpose with the villain

1025
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.380
all right

1026
01:40:35.699 --> 01:40:40.320
there's more to it than the dying and
the resurrecting but something that I've

1027
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:47.000
really realized about video game
adaptations is that

1028
01:40:47.219 --> 01:40:54.360
you you need to give people the feeling
of playing the game without making it

1029
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.600
feel like a video game
um

1030
01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.520
that's why the Mario movie was such a
huge success because watching like it's

1031
01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.600
not that good it's not that good it's
the movie's not that good but watching

1032
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.600
it
it almost feels like you're playing a

1033
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.080
Mario game
um and I think you you have to go with

1034
01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.900
that kind of thing unless you're doing
live action

1035
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:21.480
super realism like with the last of us
which even the last of us like actually

1036
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.980
like went in the opposite direction it
had less zombies and stuff like that or

1037
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:29.219
less infected
um

1038
01:41:29.219 --> 01:41:35.219
but that's that's what makes me nervous
about the potential Zelda movie that

1039
01:41:35.219 --> 01:41:38.639
might be coming from illumination I
don't want that to happen

1040
01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:42.840
I thought the Mario movie was an all was
all right but I did enjoy the video game

1041
01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.860
inspired sequences
yeah I thought the movie was fine

1042
01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:52.920
um I watched
I waited and I watched it in Japanese

1043
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.580
um the Japanese dub so they didn't have
to listen to Chris Pratt

1044
01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.699
um

1045
01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.119
and uh
so that was fun

1046
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.880
or it was lacking a want versus need and
his story in my opinion oh that

1047
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.980
that a lot it was lacking a lot

1048
01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.840
the thing with the the Mario movie is
that it was just kind of mindless fun

1049
01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:36.179
and I think that's
what a lot of people need right now is

1050
01:42:36.179 --> 01:42:42.600
just some mindless fun
nothing that's trying to be serious or

1051
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.199
dour or anything like that nothing
that's trying to take itself seriously

1052
01:42:46.199 --> 01:42:50.300
just
silliness

1053
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:59.420
Gulf kanawak I know how to pronounce
that

1054
01:42:59.719 --> 01:43:03.199
I'm learning

1055
01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:15.980
oh we got pretty lips

1056
01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.100
very kissable

1057
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:31.020
watched a relatively new interview with
Pedro Pascal they asked if he knows what

1058
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.619
Joel's next step in the story was he
said yes they asked if you knew the

1059
01:43:34.619 --> 01:43:39.199
details and he was like No And I don't
wanna oh God

1060
01:43:41.119 --> 01:43:44.540
poor Pedro

1061
01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.260
do you speak any other languages than
English I don't speak them

1062
01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:13.400
but I can read uh German and French
um

1063
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:20.420
relatively well I can get by for German
and French but I can't speak them

1064
01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.179
James doesn't screen share when you're
looking up the names

1065
01:44:27.179 --> 01:44:33.679
I would but it's such a pain in the ass
to add screens in obs

1066
01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.540
laughs
not sure if you watch American Dad but

1067
01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:07.980
Stan Smith said he's a power top
oh my God uh I haven't watched American

1068
01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:12.119
Dad in years and years but that's that's
kind of hilarious

1069
01:45:12.119 --> 01:45:17.400
and I don't I don't know if a power top
I feel like a power top is just a top

1070
01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.780
that has convinced themselves
that being rough makes them good at sex

1071
01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:35.480
I keep being selfish there's no way I
could cool them on my own

1072
01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:41.179
a power top sounds so scary

1073
01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.800
yeah Dom top sounds like the the right
word yeah

1074
01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.800
a power top sounds like something you
add to a car

1075
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.260
I am excited for the new season of good
Omens I can't remember when it comes out

1076
01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.600
uh comes out at the end of this end of
July

1077
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.900
oh thank you again Jen
fun fact if you watch Titanic in Reverse

1078
01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.860
it's about zombies rising from the ocean
to rebuild a Shipwrecked boat and then

1079
01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:24.239
going to England to play poker
sounds like an amazing amazing movie

1080
01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:27.619
honestly I'd watch that

1081
01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.800
there's a fine line between rough this
is fun and rough what are you doing to

1082
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.920
me

1083
01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:50.400
at this point I'd probably take it
anyway I could get it

1084
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.440
a power top is who you want driving

1085
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.280
I think I that might be me

1086
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.000
a dummy toffee

1087
01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:07.380
dummy toppy
sounds like a Rugrats villain or

1088
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.560
something

1089
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:44.400
laughs
oh Twitter I open up Twitter the first

1090
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.940
thing that comes up is somebody showing
their butt

1091
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:52.040
sounds like a candy with a terrible
marketing team

1092
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:56.540
Park hyung soap

1093
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.980
oh I love his ears

1094
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.400
I have a thing for big ears

1095
01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.060
I think she's about five about
Tops on the planet

1096
01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:41.410
[Laughter]

1097
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:55.260
oh did he also declare a slur
I love that he declared it a slur and

1098
01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:59.880
then it became the number one trending
topic on Twitter it's like

1099
01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:05.540
good job good job
God that man is dumb

1100
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.119
he did declare cisgender a slur because
he's an idiot

1101
01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.780
I'm good average dummy do me dummy do me
dumb I'm gonna say dummy huh

1102
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.280
uh average dummy I'm getting ready to
head out probably in about 10 minutes at

1103
01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:51.659
nine o'clock uh around the two hour mark
uh get back to editing

1104
01:49:51.659 --> 01:49:57.840
because I have a video along along a
longer longish video that I'm working on

1105
01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.840
that'll be the last public video Until
the fall uh patrons are still gonna get

1106
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:09.420
videos throughout the summer but for the
channel this is the last one until uh

1107
01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.260
until the fall

1108
01:50:19.739 --> 01:50:23.820
I love that porn couple on Tick Tock
that the top is a twink and the bottom

1109
01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:29.119
is a hunk and then the same age what
people think the hunk is way older

1110
01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.820
I don't know who that is do you have a
name I want to see them now

1111
01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:44.940
I can't wait to do the magical girls
video that one comes out in August I

1112
01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.699
think for patrons so I think it'll be
November that that'll be out in for just

1113
01:50:50.699 --> 01:50:53.880
typical YouTube
um

1114
01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:59.719
but yeah I'm pretty I think that's
August for patrons and YouTube members

1115
01:51:14.159 --> 01:51:18.260
let's look up Jake Preston

1116
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:34.520
there's a lot of different Jake Prestons
apparently

1117
01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:40.520
Jake Preston on Twitter

1118
01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:49.940
oh there's a penis
oh I follow him apparently

1119
01:51:58.679 --> 01:52:02.540
apparently I'm already following him all
right

1120
01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.900
last name James

1121
01:52:15.139 --> 01:52:22.760
I'm not gonna try I try I tried it was
bad I tried pronouncing it I failed

1122
01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:39.000
this is a really weird thought but I
like his eyebrows

1123
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.679
I really like his eyebrows
why is that the first thing that came to

1124
01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:46.639
mind
foreign

1125
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.800
inducing it feels sometimes interacting
with people

1126
01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.179
I hear you there

1127
01:53:06.239 --> 01:53:11.940
is a Swede I don't claim PewDiePie
I only stay on Twitter to keep my handle

1128
01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:17.159
from getting hijacked I don't
read anything on the site anymore I I

1129
01:53:17.159 --> 01:53:23.040
have a bad habit of
uh being on Twitter a lot

1130
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:28.500
um I need to be on Twitter less
but I'm on it

1131
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:33.239
a lot because my my normal like feed is
like

1132
01:53:33.239 --> 01:53:38.040
people sharing their art and you know
people sharing stuff that they like and

1133
01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:43.440
then the for you section of Twitter is
just this hellscape that Elon is trying

1134
01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.540
to push on people
and I'm like how about no

1135
01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:51.980
how about that how about no

1136
01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:57.719
and wrestling a lot of my Twitter is
wrestling

1137
01:53:57.719 --> 01:53:59.900
foreign

1138
01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:27.239
Twitter is amazing I took a month off of
Twitter last year when I got canceled

1139
01:54:27.239 --> 01:54:30.960
um
and it was it was quite relaxing

1140
01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.699
it was
um

1141
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:38.760
but unfortunately
as someone with a YouTube channel I have

1142
01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.300
to be on it

1143
01:54:46.139 --> 01:54:49.679
if you read the three body problem
series and or have you watched the

1144
01:54:49.679 --> 01:54:52.880
teaser for the Netflix series

1145
01:54:56.219 --> 01:54:59.420
and I had to think about that

1146
01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:02.880
I think power topping might be whatever
it is that Blitz does to stole us with

1147
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.510
Paradise
[Laughter]

1148
01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:23.880
foreign
but it sucked but yeah I don't want to

1149
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.300
talk about it

1150
01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:33.360
I wasn't canceled there were some
mean people

1151
01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.219
who sicked some people after me

1152
01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:42.960
I found the ditching Facebook four years
ago was a good choice I yeah I I left

1153
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.320
Facebook a couple years ago I think
actually four years ago

1154
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.860
now that you yeah I think it might have
been four years ago

1155
01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:54.480
I was really only on Facebook
um

1156
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.280
so that my mom could uh get in touch
with me and then she finally picked up

1157
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.040
texting
um so I didn't have to worry about it

1158
01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.280
anymore

1159
01:56:13.739 --> 01:56:20.280
oh I'm glad this can be a good space for
you Nicholson uh three Nicholson's AU

1160
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.420
it's a it's always I always feel bad
when I can't like immediately see

1161
01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:28.699
someone's name and chat I feel like I'm
failing

1162
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.619
I got like a few Facebook friends I want
to stay in touch with but don't want a

1163
01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:43.380
message
yeah since I got rid of Facebook I

1164
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:49.500
completely lost touch with like all of
my friends from back home just gone

1165
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.020
um
God these

1166
01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.940
Twitter speaking of Twitter
um

1167
01:56:55.940 --> 01:57:01.560
and like I'm like hey follow me on
Twitter or Instagram or

1168
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:08.159
you know the other things that I have
you know text me or whatever and

1169
01:57:08.159 --> 01:57:12.239
they're like oh I don't have Twitter or
Instagram or anything I'm like how do

1170
01:57:12.239 --> 01:57:18.139
you not have Instagram
and Facebook are the same thing

1171
01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:24.780
I don't use Facebook but I do use
messenger from time to time it really

1172
01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:29.639
sucked when I was in uh when I worked in
marketing because you had to have like

1173
01:57:29.639 --> 01:57:33.960
an active Facebook profile or Facebook
wouldn't let you take over accounts

1174
01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:39.300
and I had to take over accounts to do ad
buys and stuff like that and so it was

1175
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:43.080
really frustrating because I had to
arbitrarily post

1176
01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.820
like
like four or five times a week just to

1177
01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:52.139
keep my account in good standing in good
standing in good standing so that I

1178
01:57:52.139 --> 01:57:55.139
could
take over the the accounts I needed to

1179
01:57:55.139 --> 01:57:57.980
it was really annoying

1180
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.320
I don't have Instagram because I deleted
my account but it has been tough to

1181
01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.099
follow some of the people whose work I
like without it

1182
01:58:14.099 --> 01:58:18.239
my Instagram is like my happy place I go
there it's just

1183
01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:24.179
sheba's pitbulls Dobermans
um

1184
01:58:24.179 --> 01:58:28.440
red panda is it's basically just animals
being silly

1185
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:34.139
and a couple of cute guys that I follow
and that's basically it Instagram is

1186
01:58:34.139 --> 01:58:40.020
like a safe happy place I can go and ads
for stuff that I oddly have bought a

1187
01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:44.580
couple of things from there and they're
actually useful which is says a lot more

1188
01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:47.760
than the uh
the Twitter

1189
01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:50.239
thing

1190
01:58:55.679 --> 01:59:00.619
I suck at Reddit I've never been good at
Reddit

1191
01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.380
I have an on-again African relationship
with Instagram because now that I'm out

1192
01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:12.540
of school I don't want anything to do
with most of the people from there but I

1193
01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:15.860
can't be bothered to block them or
anything

1194
01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:21.780
I mainly use Facebook to shout my
depression and unrequited love into the

1195
01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:26.300
voice so I used to say it was not
popular on there

1196
01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:36.380
I have letterboxed but I always forget
that it exists so I never use it

1197
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:43.619
I follow way too many hot Thai BL actors
and somehow Asian fitness models along

1198
01:59:43.619 --> 01:59:49.400
with celebrities I'm shocked to find
that out great

1199
01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:59.699
what happens to the Facebook Messenger
but I'd assume that that that's less of

1200
01:59:59.699 --> 02:00:03.560
an option when you're putting creative
projects out

1201
02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:10.800
my Instagram keeps thinking I'm
transphobic because I'm

1202
02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:13.340
hahaha

1203
02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:18.840
that's like that's that sounds like
grinder continually Banning me because

1204
02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.400
I'm impersonating myself

1205
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.840
I used to use Facebook constantly like
to there were gay geek groups that I was

1206
02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.320
in there were like five or six groups I
had some friends on there and then

1207
02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.560
Facebook banned me and when I got back
on none of the groups would let me back

1208
02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:41.840
in so I don't know what the hell was
going on there

1209
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:51.179
I too have met some transphobic trans
people

1210
02:00:51.179 --> 02:00:56.460
if they're very confusing
they're like homosexual or homophobic

1211
02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:02.300
gays who I've also met I'm like go go
away go away

1212
02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:09.420
I've done the same like I have read it I
post video links on there sometimes but

1213
02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:13.739
I like never I don't know how to read it
I don't know how

1214
02:01:13.739 --> 02:01:18.480
I barely know I I also don't know how to
tick tock

1215
02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:24.480
I have tick tock I use it sometimes it's
good for when I'm like I need to know

1216
02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.500
how to fix a thing and I don't want to
watch a 12 minute video of someone

1217
02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:32.880
explaining every detail of it and then
there's like a 10 minute a 10 second

1218
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:38.340
version of it on Tick Tock and I'm like
ah perfect but that's basically the only

1219
02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:41.659
time I use tick tock

1220
02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.159
I need to do something about your ticket

1221
02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:01.219
it might basically non-exist in tick
tock

1222
02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:09.360
right it confuses me I tried to find a
BDSM thread and found in cell book

1223
02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.900
oh God

1224
02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:20.460
James once you follow one or two BL
actors it becomes a deep Rabbit Hole of

1225
02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:23.360
hotness on Instagram

1226
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:32.219
I think that's what happened with dogs
like I followed like a pit bull page and

1227
02:02:32.219 --> 02:02:37.340
a Sheba page and now everything I follow
is dogs

1228
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.440
Tick Tock also shows me a lot of
gorgeous trans men but a lot of them are

1229
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.060
straight
like I know I've I

1230
02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:59.360
yeah it's it's it's it's it's homophobic
is what it is

1231
02:03:03.719 --> 02:03:08.159
I don't like how Tick-Tock just sends me
into a hole and I can scroll it for

1232
02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:13.619
pages and just completely zone out
okay I played Judo Master on Peacemaker

1233
02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:17.699
is really hot and worth following
I like making content for Tick Tock but

1234
02:03:17.699 --> 02:03:21.500
usually use Instagram to keep up with
Finn I don't think I've ever made

1235
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:27.320
content I think I posted one thing to
tick tock

1236
02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:41.040
apparently Elliot page is straight and I
I feel like that is a personal slight

1237
02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.880
against me

1238
02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:54.480
I'm like
10 years ago you had me questioning my

1239
02:03:54.480 --> 02:04:01.760
sexuality and now that my sexuality is
like firmly confirmed uh

1240
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.840
your your
not lining up with it properly and

1241
02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.239
that's that's that's that's an issue for
me

1242
02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:29.119
you get slated all the time so it's
basically this is this is true

1243
02:04:32.219 --> 02:04:35.460
I think making behind the scenes videos
could be good content for your Tick Tock

1244
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:39.599
James
I don't know what I would do in behind

1245
02:04:39.599 --> 02:04:44.520
the scenes videos to be honest
because Nick and I kind of have it down

1246
02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.980
like the production side of it down to a
science now

1247
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:55.380
I've thought of like taking little
Snippets out of videos that are like

1248
02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:59.820
particularly funny or something like
that and throwing them up on Tick Tock

1249
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:02.000
um

1250
02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.679
but
that's like the only thing I can think

1251
02:05:07.679 --> 02:05:09.860
of

1252
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:21.619
I'm a straight and I'm not okay

1253
02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.280
foreign

1254
02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:43.440
it's 905 so I'm gonna take off
um and by takeoff I mean close this

1255
02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:48.599
window and open another window and edit
myself

1256
02:05:48.599 --> 02:05:51.739
for probably the rest of the night

1257
02:05:55.139 --> 02:05:59.460
um
so I hope you had guys have an awesome

1258
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:03.900
weekend
um I might be at the Toronto Pride

1259
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:08.520
Parade on Sunday if anyone's in Toronto
um

1260
02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:12.000
if not I'll probably be taking pictures
and posting them on Twitter and

1261
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:17.060
Instagram and stuff like that so I hope
you all have a wonderful weekend

1262
02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:21.599
and
um new video coming very very soon hope

1263
02:06:21.599 --> 02:06:26.639
you watch it hope you like it because I
like it I mean everyone have a good

1264
02:06:26.639 --> 02:06:28.820
night
