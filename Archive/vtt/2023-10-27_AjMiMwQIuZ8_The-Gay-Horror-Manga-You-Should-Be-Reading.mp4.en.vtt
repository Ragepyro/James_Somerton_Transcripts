[Music]

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.920
on a scorching day in rural Japan we
find ourselves in the midst of a

10
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.480
chilling tale where two boys yoshiki and
yaru seek Solace from the Relentless

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.480
Heat by indulging in frozen treats from
a quaint local store Outdoors amidst

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.559
their laughter a sudden unease grips
yoshiki prompting him to utter these

13
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.360
haunted words to his
friend you ain't the real iaru are you

14
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.759
iaru initially taken aback undergos a
startling transformation as his human

15
00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.600
facade Fades away revealing the Demonic
spiritual entity lurking within however

16
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.000
instead of unleashing his malevolence
upon yoshiki hearu surprises us all by

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.159
embracing his friend pleading with him
not to reveal his true nature you see

18
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.799
this is the first time this new iaru has
experienced Life as a human even if he's

19
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.240
borrowing the old hikaru's form his
feelings for yoshiki are undeniably

20
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.719
genuine the real iaru may be lost but
yoshiki consumed by grief and fear

21
00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:55.000
accepts this new Hikaru into his
life for he cannot bear to be without

22
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.719
his friend thus Begins the spine
tingling horror manga the summer Hikaru

23
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.640
died by the mangaka
mumen it debuted in August of 2021 and

24
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.400
has enjoyed resounding Commercial
Success despite the unease it provokes

25
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.360
among commentators within the medium who
have a hard time categorizing it is it a

26
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.519
BL manga is it horror can it possibly be
both the difficulty in classifying the

27
00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.840
genre of this story itself puts us at an
interesting juncture with gay boys being

28
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.000
a genre all to their own perhaps this
has set a precedent for gay characters

29
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.959
being unable to appear in other genres
does the inclusion of a gay character

30
00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.319
automatically facilitate a gay story it
seems that among Publishers and critics

31
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.400
this may very well be the case meaning
that when a horror story about one or

32
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.720
possibly more gay characters becomes a
sensation there's a reluctance to

33
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.319
discuss it because it's unclear whether
whether it ought to be judged on its

34
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.959
merits as horror or as be this speaks to
a common complaint among non-binary

35
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.159
people and some trans people as well why
does the inability to sort things into

36
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.599
one of two categories generates so much
confusion is it gay or straight are they

37
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.959
a man or a
woman in either case many people won't

38
00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.360
neatly fit into either of these groups
and it's just as incorrect to force

39
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.360
people into these categories as it is to
Omit people altogether because they

40
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.120
can't pass similarly it's also wrong to
look at the summer hi could who died in

41
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.640
the same way genre classification limits
the scope of what a story can be and is

42
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.280
often biased to what the hegemonistic
majority considers normal I wouldn't

43
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.879
take it as a good sign either if it were
classified as a cross genre for the same

44
00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.879
reason that we don't consider straight
horror to be a genre

45
00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.040
boys kissing and scary do not need to be
two different

46
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.040
genres because when you're a gay boy
living in a rural Village kissing

47
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.239
another boy is very scary and it also
seems that the summer Hikaru died

48
00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.880
explores many of these same
Horrors even though whatever has

49
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.120
replaced his friend speaks with that
voice and projects those emotions yosiki

50
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.880
is left in mourning regardless caught
between everything is different and

51
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.080
nothing has
changed yoshiki grapples with the fact

52
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.800
that Hikaru still acts normal while he
feels that he has lost something that he

53
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.199
will never get back this new iaru though
he smiles laughs and cries just like his

54
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:53.199
predecessor is not the same the thing
that replaced dearu has adopted all

55
00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.280
hau's memories and feelings
pragmatically this zaru ought to be no

56
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.960
different different than the previous
one yoshiki is unsure if he can go on

57
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.320
with his life without a clear answer
though no matter how much yoshiki wishes

58
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.800
this thing were still
Hikaru some things are just off

59
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.240
especially at first he exhibits an
unnatural enthusiasm from mundane

60
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.039
experiences and even kind-hearted
animals cower in his presence but the

61
00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.680
thing that replaced Dadu is just so
thankful for his friend's

62
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.479
acceptance for yoshiki to show kindness
to someone like him however yoshiki

63
00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.520
grapples internally he questions his own
sanity for embracing this being this

64
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.600
entity that once was his friend his
disqui only intensifies when some towns

65
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.880
folk react to Hikaru as if he were the
very monster that had taken residence

66
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.800
within him it's important to note that
this new U never harmed the real one

67
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.880
while some may be hesitant to trust a
monster this is confirmed in a flashback

68
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.280
the original Hikaru dying alone in the
forest had pleaded for someone to

69
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.680
protect
yoshiki and that's when this enigmatic

70
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.240
Spirit inhabited his body now it carries
the warmth and love Hikaru felt for

71
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.400
yoshiki vowing to safeguard him by any
means

72
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.400
necessary the thing that replaced iaru
lacks the social awareness of being a

73
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.319
born and raised human and declares the
feelings that the previous iaru had kept

74
00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:45.440
hidden from yoshiki that he's crazy for
him which ought to betray any doubt that

75
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.759
Hikaru is gay or gay
questioning while it is not a specific

76
00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.919
classification on this part the phrasing
and context of this line says all that

77
00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.720
it needs
to subtlety shouldn't need to be

78
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.000
specific to be apparent what isn't
subtle is that there is something much

79
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.879
darker and more ominous lurking in this
quaint little town than our sweet eadu

80
00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:18.800
the forest covered Mountain itself is
alive teeming with Spirits some far less

81
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.680
benign than the one residing in this boy
when a group of their school friends

82
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.879
take a shortcut through the forest one
day they feel uneasy especially y

83
00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:35.199
Shiki there's an ominous presence
watching them drawing

84
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:42.199
nearer it lunges Ed yoshiki attempting
to possess him but garu steps in

85
00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:46.280
absorbing the spirit battling it to
Shield his

86
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.759
friend the fight even makes his nose
bleed iaru warns yoshiki about spirits

87
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:59.360
that they're lonely and latch onto
anyone who gazes upon them he advises

88
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.400
yoshiki to avoid looking at any Spirits
except for him yet Hikaru is not as

89
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.440
Adept at concealing his Secrets as he
believes one of their friends a girl

90
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.639
named oo senses something a Miss she
can't quite put her finger on it but she

91
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:26.120
knows that aaru's nose bleed was no
random occurrence curiosity naing at him

92
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.640
yoshiki longs to understand how Hikaru
took the spirit inside of him unable to

93
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.360
convey it verbally yaru decides to
demonstrate it physically when they are

94
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.519
alone he exposes a dark slit in his
chest inviting yoshiki to plunge his

95
00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:49.600
hand
inside the spirit beyond the form of igu

96
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.160
is tumultuous chaotic and cold a
sensation yoshiki Compares towards raw

97
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.760
chicken and marinade Hikaru finds great
pleasure in the feeling of a warm body a

98
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.000
sensation he cannot even recall having
as a spirit unexpectedly he draws the

99
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.440
arm deeper inside of him sending yoshiki
into a panic reeling away Hikaru laughs

100
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.240
and tries to assure yoshiki that he was
never in any harm he was just Hing

101
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.480
around this is a pivotal scene for
framing the whole of the series and

102
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.160
cementing this story is not only
containing gay characters but presenting

103
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.600
gay
experiences without being explicit this

104
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.120
scene portrays a representation of
sexual

105
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:45.160
experimentation while U's enjoyment is
apparent yoshiki is confused as to

106
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.000
whether he likes the sensation or not
hiu while abiding by consent does push

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.079
boundaries a bit too fast for yoshiki
moving at different speeds is also a

108
00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:03.120
Hallmark of developing queer identity
to yoshiki there is an element of danger

109
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.760
with this and this danger articulates an
ongoing theme in the series about the

110
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.560
thing that repaced iaru should we be
afraid of it or not because an act of

111
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.120
iaru just playing
around is a horror to yoshiki regardless

112
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.040
that garu himself is aware of the
difference between play and harm yoshiki

113
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.600
does not know the limitations and
abilities of this spirit it being

114
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.240
harmless and meaning no harm are two
different things a question that

115
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.880
persistently looms over the head of the
thing that replaced Hikaru these

116
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.160
anxieties compound within yoshiki in
addition to his questions of whether he

117
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.360
can think of the thing that replaced
iaru as

118
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.680
Hikaru he now has questions about his
own feelings for

119
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.240
himself in the fever of this internal
struggle he has a chance encounter with

120
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.839
a woman from town she does not recognize
him but she recognizes something about

121
00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:07.480
him she reveals that she used to sense
an ominous presence emanating from the

122
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.079
mountainous Forest the very mountains
where iaru met his end however she

123
00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:18.680
remarks that the malevolence that once
resided far away has now crossed into

124
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.040
the
village and she spies that this

125
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.639
malevolence has touched
yoshiki expressing concern for him she

126
00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:33.680
explains that as human draw closer to
the spirits and the realm of spirits

127
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.000
they become
mixed she warns that yoshiki is doomed

128
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.639
if he continues his entanglement with
the thing that replaced

129
00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:48.279
taru the first of a series of warnings
against mixing with others who should

130
00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:54.560
remain separate this Revelation deepens
yoshiki's disqui around garu though

131
00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.240
guilt gnaws at him whenever they're
together for iaru is unfailingly kind

132
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.880
professing that just being near yoshiki
brings him Joy but that's not a mutual

133
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.360
feeling for yoshiki the way Hikaru looks
sounds talks it's all

134
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.360
Hikaru but he's not Hikaru but the
spirit can't let yoshiki go because he

135
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.040
feels everything iaru felt he liked him
too

136
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.880
much his feelings for yoshiki were so
strong that even after death they

137
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.160
remained and they bind the spirit to him
terrified yoshiki demands that iaru

138
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.880
leave him be claiming he no longer needs
him this send iaru spiraling into

139
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.639
despair questioning why he isn't enough
what's really so different about him

140
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:49.519
he's the same person more or less only
one thing has changed and it's not even

141
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:54.720
something most people can
see he just doesn't want yoshiki to hate

142
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.199
him the next day yoshiki
apologizes in tears iaru tells yoshiki

143
00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:06.279
he just wants to be near him that's all
that's all that he needs to please just

144
00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:11.639
not hate him instead of forsaking his
friend yoshiki opts to stand by hikaru's

145
00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:17.920
side heedless of the ominous warnings he
has received the once fearful animals

146
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.800
gradually warm up to iaru and he joins
yoshiki and his younger sister at a

147
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.639
Summer Festival just like any ordinary
kid but has to turn back when he comes

148
00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:33.560
up against the to gate blocking the
spirit from entering the Shinto Shrine

149
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.600
so yoshiki gets some shaved ice for both
of them and they eat it outside the gate

150
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.720
there yoshiki reveals something to iaru
that his friend didn't know that he'd

151
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.120
actually
seenu's dead body the stormy night he

152
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.480
went missing yoshiki trudged out into
the rain marching through the forest

153
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.199
until he found his friend's body
unresponsive the trauma left him

154
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:04.839
bedridden for days and when he finally
came around iaru was

155
00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:10.959
alive this knew Hikaru was alive he
grieved the loss of his closest friend

156
00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:15.240
for days before finding out that he was
still here in some

157
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.680
way he thought it was a
dream but even now sitting next to iadu

158
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:28.880
as he is he misses his old friend in
response iaru pledges to yoshiki that

159
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:35.279
although he may never truly replace the
original he will always cherish and

160
00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:41.839
protect him however at this point in the
manga we take a departure from the tale

161
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:46.959
to uncover a council of individuals well
versed in the spiritual happenings of

162
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:51.000
the
area something known as kubit ASI's

163
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.519
burden has escaped the confines of the
forest and infiltrated the

164
00:14:55.519 --> 00:15:01.279
town as a result they've enlisted the
services of an expert to investigate

165
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:07.639
this phenomenon firsthand This spells
danger for iaru and also yoshiki the

166
00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:12.480
pair begin growing close again yoshiki
even puts his hand in hikaru's body once

167
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.320
more this time permitting himself to
wonder if it does feel good in spite of

168
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.120
telling himself it ought to feel wrong
but getting this close to iaru might be

169
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.440
dangerous According to some it might
attract other things from the spiritual

170
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.639
side toward Yoshi
things more dangerous and unpredictable

171
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:35.800
than his smiling
friend like some sort of demon lurking

172
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.279
in yoshiki shower drain that attacks his
little sister a demon iaru promises to

173
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:46.560
deal with but when iaru seems to be
taking too long yoshiki becomes worried

174
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.160
and comes to rescue him the demon takes
the opportunity to Lunge into yoshiki

175
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:59.040
take over his mind and forces him to try
and drown garu the demon is expelled and

176
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.920
escapes giving yoshiki a glimpse into
the danger that Spirits present as Time

177
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:10.120
Marches On the Council of Village Elders
redoubles their efforts to unearth the

178
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.959
truth behind the elusive Forest Spirits
Escape one fateful night amidst a

179
00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:22.880
gathering of friends iaru and yoshiki
find themselves separated leaving iaru

180
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.839
alone with oo the young girl delves into
memories of iaru from before his

181
00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:35.519
mysterious disappearance and then poses
a daunting question to the new

182
00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:42.519
hiu who exactly are you oo has a family
history of sensing Spirits some may see

183
00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:47.399
them as faint Shadows but oako can hear
them even though she can sense that

184
00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:52.600
there is something paranormal about
Hikaru she does not fear Him she recalls

185
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.360
an experience where she encountered an
invisible Spirit calling for her

186
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.759
attention on a village road trying
trying to live by her family's rules of

187
00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:05.240
remaining separate from Spirits she
eventually realized that this Spirit was

188
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.559
trying to warn her her best friend was
crossing a blind corner where a driver

189
00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:13.000
was
speeding the spirit saved her friend's

190
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.160
life while other characters who are
aware of spirits believe that not all

191
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.799
Spirits are malevolent they hold the
caveat that because some are

192
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:28.000
dangerous that we must be suspicious of
all of them oo simply does not have this

193
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.480
Outlook
instead showing a willingness to allow

194
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.520
the spirit to show its true
colors just as she affords the same

195
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.240
opportunity to the thing that replaced
yaru noticing for the first time that

196
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.360
she can see him differently than the
others the thing that replace dearu

197
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.120
tries to show her his true form that
which he can only describe to yoshiki

198
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.720
perhaps she can see him for what he
truly is stripped of the physical form

199
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.280
he does after all repeatedly mention
that Spirits are lonely

200
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.760
and long to be seen is he truly so
different their connection while brief

201
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:10.760
causes oo to collapse just as yoshiki is
in view in a frantic State he fears that

202
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.919
Hikaru may have killed her the thing
that replaced Hikaru expresses confusion

203
00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:21.480
at these anxieties he struggles to grasp
the distinction between life and death

204
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.600
not a foreign concept to him entirely
but he simply sees no empirical

205
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.360
difference between something Al alive
and the same thing while dead thankfully

206
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.679
oo regains Consciousness having merely
fainted remarkably her first concern

207
00:18:36.679 --> 00:18:41.720
isn't for her own well-being but for
hikaru's she recognizes that he's been

208
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.960
possessed and seems willing to help but
yoshiki cannot bear the weight of it all

209
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.600
and decides to depart leaving yaru to
ponder the profound questions of life

210
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.600
and death alone yaru wrestles with
existential questions contemplating the

211
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.440
meaning of being alive he dreads the
thought of losing those he cares about

212
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.039
especially yoshiki he's uncertain
whether his thoughts are truly his own

213
00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:13.600
or remnants of the old IU's
Consciousness lingering within him what

214
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.720
he fears most is that he may have
irreparably driven yoshiki away however

215
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.760
when yoshiki unexpectedly appears
ataru's doorstep on Monday offering to

216
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.440
take him to school Hikaru is both
astonished and elated did to his

217
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.880
compounded Delight yoshiki proposes to
cut class and embark on a day of fun

218
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.280
together they visit the movie Savor
popsicles and spend time reading manga

219
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.159
for the first time since aaru's
transformation it feels like yoshiki is

220
00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:48.600
making an Earnest effort to bring
happiness into aaru's life reminiscent

221
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:54.200
of the days of their youth before aaru's
apparent demise and the arrival of the

222
00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.960
new Hikaru yet yoshiki's intentions take
a a shocking and brutal turn as he

223
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.159
plunges a knife into hikaru's abdomen
his plan was to Grant iaru one final day

224
00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:13.039
of Joy before ending his
existence but iaru does not succumb

225
00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:17.919
aaru's physical form does not have the
same limitations as a normal human

226
00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:24.240
overwhelmed by despair yoshiki realizes
that things can never return to the way

227
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.760
they were this new Karu will not release
him from his

228
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:35.799
grief consequently he implores iaru to
kill him instead iaru chooses to

229
00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:41.760
demonstrate his trust for yoshiki by
giving himself a mortal vulnerability

230
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.240
reaching into himself he pulls roughly
half of his Spirit from his body and

231
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.280
condenses it into a small stone for
yoshiki to

232
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.799
keep VI ikaru Spirit now small enough to
be harmed by lethal Force he hopes

233
00:20:56.799 --> 00:21:00.440
yoshiki can trust him
deciding to move forward as friends the

234
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:06.960
boys stand before another hurdle to
truly trust each other they need to know

235
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.480
what the thing that replaced iaru
was before it became iaru the why and

236
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.440
how are already known yoshiki takes the
fragment of aaru's spirit and decides to

237
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.480
help him find out what he really is
during their

238
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.440
investigation they discovered that their
little village called Mount Hope was

239
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.799
once part of a much larger
domain but near the end of the Ido

240
00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:41.760
period split into the five smaller
Villages it exists as today the split

241
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.400
was caused by famine economic strife and
a number of strange unexplainable deaths

242
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.880
locals attribute those deaths now to the
Lord brain

243
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.360
snatcher a malevolent God within the
mountainous Forest that plagued the

244
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.600
people of the domain but it's believed
to have been trapped within the

245
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.039
boundaries of the forest ever since the
famine like the deaths might have

246
00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:13.200
actually been sacrifices in a protective
ritual against it and aaru's family for

247
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.039
centuries have been the Protectors of
the

248
00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:20.960
boundary going into the mountains to
conduct a ritual that would keep solid

249
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.039
the barrier between the realm of the
Lord brain snatcher and the human world

250
00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:30.400
but when Hikaru died performing it and
then came

251
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:37.080
back he brought something back with
him is Hikaru the Lord brain

252
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.039
snatcher or is he something
else this as of

253
00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:49.919
now is where the story has left off we
can see Hikaru as dead possessed by an

254
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:54.159
impostor but shunning this new creature
doesn't change the fact that the

255
00:22:54.159 --> 00:23:01.520
original Hikaru is gone alternative L we
can observe this spirit's intervention

256
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.919
as a chance encounter to allow Hikaru to
live

257
00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:11.960
on I consider the latter more
optimistic aren't people always changing

258
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.600
anyway a person cannot walk through the
same river

259
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.520
twice they're no longer the same person
nor is it the same river what is this

260
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.880
possession but another albeit radical
form of

261
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.559
change the alternative is that iaru
stays dead the lingering question

262
00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:37.919
hanging in the air is the mystery of
intention what is this story trying to

263
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:44.559
say perhaps it's as indicative of queer
experiences as I've outlined indeed it

264
00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:49.640
is focused on a queer character but how
does the author plan on moralizing

265
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.720
this what should we do about the monster
is the monster even something to be

266
00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:01.240
feared or is this a looming cautionary
Tale about mixing with the others this

267
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:08.600
is information we do not as of yet have
mangas are notorious for their anonymity

268
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.880
and for good reason for manga what is on
the page is what is intended to be read

269
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.039
everything else is what you bring and
take away from

270
00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:22.760
it only as the tale unfolds will we
understand it all and what this has to

271
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.600
say about mixing that depends entirely
on what Hikaru is

272
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:35.320
is Hikaru truly the Lord brain
snatcher there are many spirits perhaps

273
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.520
he is another after all the Elder
Council references kubachi burden is

274
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.240
this the brain snatcher or something
else a protective Force created to keep

275
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.120
the evil spirits within the dark domain
of the Mountain Forest perhaps this is

276
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.240
what Hikaru is instead however I choose
to believe the resolution will support a

277
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.760
mixing of human and spirit
they are not without vulnerabilities and

278
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.320
we are not without
strengths after all there are various

279
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.240
humans in this story who generate as
much or more threat than the lonely

280
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.559
needy
spirits and there are some who are even

281
00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:21.440
as hostile and chaotic as the malicious
ones we fear the spirits only because we

282
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.320
are not familiar with their
intentions in English we have a phrase

283
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.240
better than the devil you know I
generally prefer to trust creators and

284
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.720
people in Creative fields for having the
best of intentions for leaning toward

285
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.559
social growth and acceptance leaning
towards

286
00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:43.320
mixing at least until they show their
true colors

287
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.480
otherwise art speaks to a need for human
connection

288
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.320
anthropologically the role of art Across
The Human Experience is to bring people

289
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.679
together through universalities of life
and

290
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:02.200
existence
biography or allegory make no difference

291
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.960
the goal is
connection to be seen and to see another

292
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.960
to find joy in commonalities to
normalize what the divisive nature of

293
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.320
society considers
taboo art for the sake of division or

294
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:26.000
isolation is of no use to
us perhaps it cannot even be called art

295
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.559
art meant to warn people against the
other is Art that's intention is

296
00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:36.080
divisive not connective art meant to
unite one group of people just to

297
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.720
exclude another is to Pander to the
archaic days of human tribalism for

298
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.760
which thousands of years of art have
been tirelessly trying to

299
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:52.760
correct perhaps because I recognize a
connection between this halfway dead boy

300
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.600
his confused best friend and a world
which wants to keep them

301
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:02.240
part I see this example of art trying to
argue that our need to connect is

302
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.320
stronger than our ability to
separate and instead of shunning what we

303
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.279
don't understand or what we fear iaru
will teach us to show

304
00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:18.440
empathy compassion and patience to those
who are

305
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:26.360
different who don't fit
in and even those who are by

306
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.279
