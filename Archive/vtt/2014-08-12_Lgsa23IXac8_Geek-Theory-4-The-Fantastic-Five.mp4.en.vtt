1
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.580
now the guardians of the galaxy a
little-known property if ever there was

2
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
one has become a worldwide box office
smash for Marvel I decided to have a

3
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.869
look at some of the other lesser-known
Marvel characters who i'd like to see

4
00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.380
take the journey to the big screen we
all know the ones who get mentioned the

5
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
most such as Captain Marvel Black
Panther she-hulk and Nova along with

6
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.120
solo movies for Black Widow and the Hulk
but I'm talking about the characters who

7
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410
don't get listed on every what Marvel
needs do next list in fact I'm not even

8
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.980
solely focusing on heroes here just
characters I'd love to see on the big

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.289
screen okay let's get started
enchantress first introduced in 1964

10
00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.300
enchantress also known as amaura is one
of Thor's longest-running villains she

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
is one of the most powerful beings in
olive Asgard and regularly uses her

12
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
powers to charm and control the minds of
Marvel's heroes like Thor she is

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
immortal and has devoted her entire
existence to the pursuit of pleasure in

14
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.030
increasing her own power when she first
encounters Thor in the comics she makes

15
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.740
it her personal mission to seduce him
away from his mortal love Jane Foster

16
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.369
when she fails in this endeavor she
decides her only recourse is to have

17
00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.200
Jane Foster executed a course Thor went
on to save Jane and defeat enchantress

18
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
but wouldn't this make a great setup for
the third Thor movie and if he wanted to

19
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.369
make her a more sympathetic character it
wouldn't be too difficult maybe she

20
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.600
doesn't want to kill Jane and maybe she
comes off as more of a hero in the end

21
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.619
she has been a hero a few times in the
comics and maybe they're up against an

22
00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.770
even darker more evil foe such as the
next entry on our list gore the god

23
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.549
butcher the god butcher is a pretty new
entry to the Marvel Universe having only

24
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.200
been introduced in 2013 but he is one
hell of a villain gore comes from a

25
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.670
nameless planet where his people existed
in a constant state of near death

26
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.610
growing up he was taught to believe in
the gods and that one day they would

27
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.450
answer his prayers when he was only a
child though Gore lost both his mother

28
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.190
and his father leaving him an orphan in
the harsh nameless world he survived to

29
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250
adulthood and then had a family of his
own

30
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.440
but over the years he lost all but one
of his sons then while trying to reach

31
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.000
what they believed to be a forest his
son died while Gore was promising him

32
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.060
that when they reached this forest they
would never go hungry again

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.380
grief-stricken Gore swore revenge on the
gods that had never answered his prayers

34
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
and set out on a journey across the
cosmos to murder each and every God in

35
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.440
creation and one by one he succeeded
earning the name of the god butcher

36
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.850
along the way and although he would
eventually lose to Thor who was

37
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.170
empowered by the prayers of fallen gods
gore nearly took the god of thunder down

38
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.770
with him as you can imagine gore would
be a fantastic villain for Thor 3

39
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.250
although he would certainly force the
film to be much darker than its two

40
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.480
predecessors he's an incredibly skilled
fighter especially with handheld weapons

41
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.140
which could make for some awesome action
scenes and although he is certainly

42
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.470
villainous his sympathetic backstory
would create a connection with the

43
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.980
audience at Malekith the villain from
Thor the dark world was sorely lacking

44
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.209
in fact that's one of the things that
Marvel movies haven't been that great at

45
00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.590
creating memorable villains sure we have
low key but how many other villains

46
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.620
really stick in your mind a week after
seeing the movie speaking of Dormammu

47
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.830
originally introduced as one of dr.
Strange's first villains Dormammu is

48
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.910
described as something worse than a
demon a mystical interdimensional force

49
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.620
so powerful that he's capable of almost
anything Doctor Strange himself has said

50
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.760
that Dormammu is his most terrible foe
if he was to be introduced in the movies

51
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.450
he would be the perfect introductory
villain to Doctor Strange and a villain

52
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.489
much like Loki who could be kept around
for more than just one movie besides the

53
00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.549
fact that door mom who has fought at one
point or another both the Avengers and

54
00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.540
the guardians of the galaxy he also has
direct connections with Loki and the red

55
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.440
skull if he were to be introduced in the
MCU I think it would be a good idea to

56
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.030
merge his character with another one of
Marvel's demons Mephisto Mephisto was

57
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.810
probably most well-known for wiping two
decades spider-man continuity out of

58
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.860
existence but he also played a hand in
the mental breakdown of one of the MCU

59
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.660
upcoming characters the Scarlet Witch
when Mephisto soul was broken into

60
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.470
shards two of the pieces were used to
create the twin sons of the Scarlet

61
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.050
Witch envisioned Thomas and William
however eventually Mephisto reforged

62
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.430
soul blinking the boys out of existence
this traumatic event would eventually

63
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.210
lead to the Scarlet Witch murdering
several members of the Avengers and all

64
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.409
but exterminating mutant kind so by
combining Dormammu and mephisto you

65
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.340
basically get twice as many stories for
the price of one and the Scarlet Witch

66
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.229
melting down over her lost children is
just rife for cinematic betrayal and

67
00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.330
speaking of the scarlet witch's sons the
young avengers first introduced in 2005

68
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.599
the young avengers are a group of
teenage superheroes who band together to

69
00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.190
take up the avengers mantle after the
older avengers disbanded following the

70
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.300
scarlet witch's mental breakdown the
original core group is made up of the

71
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.159
time-traveling iron lad Patriot stature
who is the daughter of the soon to be

72
00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.389
introduced ant-man a female fan of
Hawkeye who takes over his name after

73
00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.789
his death vision the shapeshifter
hulling the magic user Wiccan and the

74
00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.810
speedster so aptly named speed later on
the group would welcome new members

75
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.620
including a younger version of Loki the
dynamic of the team is great and could

76
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.039
make for some great back-and-forth
sunscreen it would also introduced the

77
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.669
first gay characters into the MCU with
Wiccan and helping being one of the most

78
00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.050
popular couples in all of Marvel Comics
besides that the characters of Wiccan

79
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.610
and speed are twin brothers separated at
birth and are eventually revealed will

80
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.050
be William and Thomas the assumed dead
children of the Scarlet Witch this would

81
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.889
be a great team to introduce in order to
add some sorely lacking diversity to the

82
00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.599
Marvel Cinematic Universe and could play
easily into any phase of the MCU that

83
00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.930
might follow an adaptation of the
scarlet witch's meltdown or the

84
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.779
disbanding of the official Avengers and
finally Marvel man or miracle man

85
00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:11.210
depending upon who you ask originally
created in 1954 by mech anglo revived in

86
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.129
1982 by comics legend Alan Moore and
most recently written by fellow comics

87
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.000
legend Neil Gaiman Marvel man was in
copyright hell for a good many years

88
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.389
with the ownership of the character
being disputed in the courts for decades

89
00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.169
but recently the character has become
the property of Marvel Comics with the

90
00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.340
writing duties being continued by Neil
Gaiman the story goes that marble man

91
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.240
started out as a young reporter named
Mickey Moran who gets trapped during a

92
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.169
terrorist raid on a nuclear power plant
and gains the powers flight super

93
00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.630
strength and invoke
ability due to the effects of the

94
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.740
radiation basically think of them as a
much darker version of superman now I

95
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.310
don't have time to go into a really
detailed backstory for Marvel man but

96
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.460
most of the back issues are now
available in reprints as well as in the

97
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.380
marvel app so I'd say check them out I
guarantee you won't be disappointed okay
