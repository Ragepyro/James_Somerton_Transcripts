00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200
foreign

2
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.039
was made early enough on Discord

3
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.119
hopefully
hope so

4
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.380
I figured I would actually do like let
people know that I was gonna stream

5
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.460
tonight instead of the usual just going
live randomly

6
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
whoop

7
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.399
s

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.680
wrong direction about Center
roughly

9
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240
hello people hello hello hello hello

10
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.260
where's my button to make things bigger
that is

11
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.820
I used the bigger button

12
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.860
it's the gentle clicking sound
is it a constant clicking sound because

13
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
that's probably the light
behind me

14
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.520
um I can turn it off if it's bugging
anyone or it might be my little

15
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880
fidgety thing

16
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740
made it in time for the first time

17
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.579
did you see the new Barbie trailer Ken
Edition no I haven't I've actually

18
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.720
stopped watching all the Barbie stuff
um

19
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.060
because oh wow it's I think my
microphone is probably popping let's

20
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.479
bring it down a few decibels that should
be a bit better

21
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.820
um I've stopped watching the Barbie
stuff because I actually want to be

22
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.840
surprised when I see it

23
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.860
it's a static

24
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.120
hmm
not sure what is what the static could

25
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.920
be is anyone else hearing any static
noise

26
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.620
background static

27
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.519
how about now

28
00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.920
oh God this microphone should not be

29
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.659
staticky
this microphone is so freaking expensive

30
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.620
um I also have the the gain on it turned
up

31
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.519
pretty high

32
00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.040
about here

33
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.560
okay and now we're gonna bring this up
here

34
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.519
right about there how does that sound is
the static on is better

35
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.019
it's it's back
very staticky

36
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.080
how is this

37
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.519
it goes up and down with the volume it
was gone when you turned the game down

38
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.479
but then came back
I have the game I mean I have it down

39
00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.120
super low right now just looking at um

40
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.080
like I meant negative 56 and I can't
hear me

41
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.720
I'm at like negative one negative 20
decibels

42
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.840
now

43
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.419
no it seems like

44
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.500
hear you and static

45
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.060
what's going on

46
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.800
okay

47
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.180
because that's natural gain

48
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.699
and how about now am I
is the static still bad can you hear me

49
00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.300
fix it oh awesome perfect okay yeah
um I had

50
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.820
levels off okay good
thumbs up everybody

51
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.520
no static but it's quiet
okay let's

52
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.759
decrease it to 10 decibels is the static
back

53
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.400
um you know is the static back

54
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.300
no awesome ah perfect okay I know where
the static was coming from

55
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:25.199
I need to uh not mess with the volume
controls on my audio interface thingy

56
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.160
because apparently it's very
touchy

57
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.620
that's where I'm gonna fly up there just
to teach you and Nick how to audio

58
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.520
better
I know that's that's one thing when we

59
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.400
go into production
um

60
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.960
this fall
uh I definitely need to hire

61
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.620
um an audio person because that is that
is something that I can I have never

62
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.360
been able to get good at never

63
00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:56.220
like
even in film school I tried I tried

64
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.340
I was very good with cameras but audio
I've never been good with audio

65
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.080
pins your Hollywood queer history videos
today which taught me so many new things

66
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.120
thank you for making them oh thank you
Olivia

67
00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.199
I know a lot of people have said that
they

68
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.759
like they they wanted to watch the
Hollywood videos but they kind of lost

69
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.240
track of them
um

70
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.199
and

71
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.139
so I was like I'll just put them all
together as one in that way anyone who

72
00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:44.580
wants to watch it can dive in and go to
the separate chapters so it's easier to

73
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.479
kind of keep track of

74
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.759
oh that must have been
um the three decibel thing that must

75
00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:00.780
have been a podcast episode where we
were talking

76
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.919
because it's so difficult when we're
recording uh when Nick and I were

77
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:11.940
recording podcasts and stuff because
I speak like this I speak pretty I like

78
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.800
I project so much and Nick's very soft
speaker

79
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.479
[Music]
um

80
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.860
it's a normal video

81
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.440
I don't know where there would be a
decibel change because I make the the

82
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.000
audio in normal videos just
flat just goes across

83
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.279
I think you're taking taking L's

84
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.080
uh katydog there's five Hollywood
history videos right now there's gonna

85
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.860
be I think another five
um

86
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.440
this fall and winter I believe
um

87
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.500
I'm not sure when they're coming back
because YouTube is

88
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.980
YouTube's being a dick with my channel
lately

89
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.600
um
so it's uh but there will be uh I will

90
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.720
complete the story the history of queer
Hollywood

91
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.860
oh thank you
oh God I was just swimming and I have

92
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.820
chlorine in my throat

93
00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:34.140
oh
oh that was rough

94
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.920
oh
how is James today James is good

95
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.540
um I'm
relatively relaxed uh my back's a little

96
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.320
sore but
um

97
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.399
I am uh
taking it easy Nick and I are working on

98
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:53.040
a movie we're working on the script for
the movie that we're going to be

99
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.700
shooting this fall we're excited for
that

100
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.120
um
and um

101
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.800
it's basically all I've done today it's
been a very relaxing day that and I I

102
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.700
laid out in the sun and swam a bit and
I uh have realized I need to start

103
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.220
applying moisturizer because I am
noticing old man cracks in my skin where

104
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.100
I I feel like I I feel like I look like
those AI old what you would look like

105
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.620
when you're old photos and it's just
really

106
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.660
um
oh it's bad

107
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.720
you ever had videos taken down just
because you're too honest and certain

108
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.279
people don't like it
um I know I've never taken a video down

109
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.160
that people didn't like
um which maybe it would have been a good

110
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.100
idea to do that with a couple of them
um the shipping video in particular the

111
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:56.640
channel really took a hit on views after
that video which is the skate video

112
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.459
um
and um

113
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.880
but I've never I've never taken a video
down because people didn't like it but I

114
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.480
have had videos taken down by YouTube
um such uh they're available on uh the

115
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.360
website nowjamesummerton.com
um that would be the gay Holocaust video

116
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.380
and the

117
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.060
um uh history of queer Panic video

118
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.360
um YouTube took those down because the
18 plused them they didn't take them

119
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.339
down they they made them 18 plus
um

120
00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:39.120
and there was a version of this the
Showgirls video that actually did get

121
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.560
taken down and so now when I log into
the back end of YouTube to like check

122
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.100
views and stuff like that there's always
this warning saying that ooh you made a

123
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.440
boo-boo and it's apparently there
forever

124
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.220
you look a bit like my middle school
math teacher and it's a bit traumatizing

125
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.940
oh God

126
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.440
hey James how has it been to talk about
videos discussing queer identities you

127
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.880
don't necessarily belong to I.E or
asexual video how did you feel

128
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.380
um well in that one in particular it was
easy because Nick is asexual

129
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.380
um
and so it was really just a discussion

130
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:27.300
back and forth I I do get nervous when I
talk about other identities because

131
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.220
you know there's there's nuances to them
that I wouldn't necessarily get because

132
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.100
I'm a very CIS White
gay man

133
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.779
um
and like I I firmly fit into the my my

134
00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:48.360
pegs fit firmly into those holes
oh God that sounds horrible

135
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.720
um
and so you know talking about bisexual

136
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:58.500
people and trans people and uh pansexual
people asexual people uh basically every

137
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.060
other letter of the alphabet Mafia
um

138
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.680
I do feel nervous that I'm gonna get
called out and sometimes I do and

139
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.700
sometimes people are very mean about it
and sometimes people are very nice uh

140
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.660
usually people are very nice and just
kind of say like hey you made a mistake

141
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.820
here or something like that but there
was there was a a war between the

142
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.660
bisexuals and pansexuals
um

143
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:31.339
around one of my videos so it's uh that
was that was stressful

144
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:44.279
profile picture from a distance
oh it kind of does yeah

145
00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:48.660
that's a city in the background but it
kind of does look like my hands are like

146
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.500
folded behind my head I've been thinking
about putting my my angel picture in

147
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.600
there just to queer it up a bit

148
00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:06.560
do you normally fit pegs into holes not
lately not lately

149
00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:14.880
so we're gonna talk about the John
Cusack thing I was I was actually kind

150
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.980
of shocked
um that someone within Hollywood

151
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.320
actually came out and
didn't talk in detail about Hollywood

152
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.639
accounting but outed the fact that
Hollywood accounting exists I was I was

153
00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:36.560
really really shocked by that I was
shocked and

154
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.240
just uh very
uh

155
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.079
that there was someone in Hollywood
finally saying what I've been saying

156
00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:49.500
like on streams and in videos and stuff
and people have lit people have called

157
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.380
me a liar saying that Hollywood
accounting exists and now I'm like well

158
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:58.760
someone in Hollywood now
has backed me up

159
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.820
I was wondering if
Rio and Akira in Devilman crybaby were

160
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.579
inspired by Sandman and Lucifer
from Sandman uh Devilman crybaby or well

161
00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:19.139
the original devil man actually came out
long before Sandman did I came out in

162
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:24.720
the 70s I think
um Devilman crybaby is a queerer version

163
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.540
for sure but there were definitely queer
overtones in the original

164
00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:37.139
help them old and irrelevant what's up
with John Cusack uh John Cusack put out

165
00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.240
a tweet
um

166
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.380
pointing out that when he signed his
contract for oh crap I can't remember

167
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.500
what movie it is now
um

168
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.320
oh it's the one with the boom box
um

169
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.660
oh I forget the movie
um but it was like a hugely huge

170
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.260
successful movie in the 1980s and when
he signed the his contract for it uh say

171
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.500
anything that's it thank you when he
signed his contract for it he signed on

172
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.480
for points which means that you get a
percentage of the profits

173
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.600
um

174
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.839
and he has never gotten any money
because whenever whenever he looks into

175
00:16:18.839 --> 00:16:23.519
it they are just like oh the movie lost
money and he knows how much it cost to

176
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:28.860
make the movie and he knows how much the
movie made and so he knows that they are

177
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.240
lying through their teeth that they are
hiding the profits which is what

178
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.500
Hollywood accounting is called and it's
I think it's the first time that an

179
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.940
actor especially a working actor has
come out and said this happens in

180
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.120
Hollywood

181
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.540
oh thank you Kiara
I can't stick around because real life

182
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.440
crap but much love is always and love
that you did the full queer history

183
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.240
compilation video oh thank you so much

184
00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:02.579
Devin saw was spilling the t2 he never
got he never got oh right he was in

185
00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:06.660
Final Destination five but it was just
like a shot from the original movie

186
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.500
right

187
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:16.140
well uh yeah he is frustrated that he's
not getting paid because say anything

188
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.179
over the years like when you take into
account the box office video rentals

189
00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:26.520
video sales DVD sales streaming all of
that like

190
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.419
there's probably like a million dollars
that he would have been paid out of that

191
00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:33.900
give or take
um

192
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.960
in either direction by quite a bit
probably but like there's a excuse me a

193
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.580
substantial amount of money
that he should have been paid for that

194
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.580
movie
that he has not been paid

195
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.760
and that's all because of Hollywood
accounting because Executives hide

196
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.799
profits from actors and writers and
behind the scenes people every everyone

197
00:17:55.799 --> 00:18:00.120
who works on a movie anyone who signs up
for points they what they basically do

198
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.179
is they agree to take a percentage of
the profits

199
00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:07.950
for a lower upfront pay and when that
happens producers

200
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:13.500
[Music]
can mess around with the accounting and

201
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.940
say like oh we actually lost money on
this sorry you're you're getting paid

202
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.799
not nearly as much as you should have

203
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.860
still can't believe Executives in
Hollywood thought actors were going to

204
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.260
be okay with digital I know the digital
copied on

205
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:38.880
for for anyone who isn't following the
the SAG and wga strike sag is the Screen

206
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.260
Actors Guild
um the studios

207
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:50.039
wanted to make a copy
of especially specifically extras that

208
00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:55.580
they wanted to hire an extra for a day
rate which is about 250 for the day

209
00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:02.460
and scan them into a computer
and then never hire them again but they

210
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.820
would own their likeness in perpetuity
for 250 bucks for 250 dollars you sell

211
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.740
your likeness to a movie studio who can
then use your likeness as a CG created

212
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.280
thing forever and ever and ever and you
get no more money for the rest of your

213
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.460
life because you sold it for that one
day's work

214
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.480
and it's like
and this is this is what the studios

215
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.760
said was their compromise
what was their original pitch

216
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.260
like if that's
if that's what they were like oh this

217
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.940
this is us giving up something what were
the originally demanding like Jesus

218
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.240
Christ

219
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.960
I've sold my dignity for myself yeah but
you can get your dignity back

220
00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:59.039
James as a sad lesbian I have to ask you
are you still an Ervin Levi denier

221
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.340
um I've watched Attack on Titan two or
three times since two or three more

222
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.440
times since the video
[Music]

223
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.640
um
I will admit

224
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.220
I can see it I I can see it when you
look for it it's especially it's much

225
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.720
more obvious in the manga and it's much
more obvious in the Japanese dub

226
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.559
um I don't think it's as obvious in the
English dub as it is in the manga and

227
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:27.480
the Japanese dub same with hanji being
non-binary like in the English dub of

228
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.260
Attack on Titan hanji is just a female
character but in the manga and the

229
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.360
Japanese dub hanji's non-binary

230
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.580
oh yeah I saw the Ron permit the Ron
Perlman video

231
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:53.160
and I also if you haven't watched Fran
drescher's speech she's the friend well

232
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.700
she was the nanny
um friend she was the nanny on the

233
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.539
sitcom the nanny in the 90s
um and she's also currently the

234
00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:06.120
president of the Screen Actors Guild and
she went off on them yesterday and today

235
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.600
is Bastille Day and yesterday she I
forget the exact quote but it was

236
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.860
basically you know eventually the French
peasants went and started cutting heads

237
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.640
off it's like whoo she's not messing
around

238
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.299
San Diego Comic-Con coming around the
corner I wonder if any A-list actors

239
00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:38.820
will show up they're not allowed
um they can show up if they buy a ticket

240
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:45.840
and they go to just like look at comics
and art and stuff like that but if they

241
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.820
go if they show up to promote anything
they are breaking sag regulations and

242
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.460
they'll be kicked out of the Actors
Guild and they'll never work again

243
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:06.179
Alejandro the vast majority of actors in
in the Screen Actors Guild

244
00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:10.620
have to work a second job they do not
make enough money acting to be able to

245
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.760
pay bills you're thinking of movie stars
there's a big difference between actors

246
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.919
and movie stars a huge difference

247
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.039
um most actors do not make a living wage
only one percent only one percent of

248
00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:31.280
actors in The Screen Actors Guild
actually make a living wage

249
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.240
execs probably wanted to pay an hourly
rate to do the likeness process take the

250
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.700
pick in a couple of hours and pay them
like 50 bucks I wouldn't be uh

251
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.720
the only saving grace there is uh
because of Union regulations they

252
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.500
couldn't pay an hourly wage they would
have to pay the day wage but I'm sure

253
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.039
they would have loved to have been able
to just pay an hourly wage to do it oh

254
00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.880
thank you roach dog

255
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.900
Fran was pissed yes she was
I I've she should run for president or

256
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.520
something she's she's got fire in her
belly

257
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.559
same with voice Talent they have always
stated going to conventions have helped

258
00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:24.140
with income
I think I think

259
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:30.419
uh I think there's a different Union for
people who specifically do voice acting

260
00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:32.600
um

261
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.960
so I don't think they're actually
included in the strike

262
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.260
my husband is a playwright and I know so
many actors in New York City that have

263
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.400
multiple day jobs in addition to all the
work on Law and Order yeah and that

264
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.640
that's the thing is like acting doesn't
pay as much as people think it does

265
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.360
especially considering where you need to
live to be a working actor you need to

266
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.880
live in Los Angeles or New York where
you're not exactly cheap places to live

267
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.020
um
it's it it's

268
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:09.000
you usually need to have another job
um

269
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.539
it's like your your passion may be
acting but you need a job to pay the

270
00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:14.840
bills

271
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.940
most actors I actually know pay more to
stay in sags and they make acting yeah

272
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.840
because sag gives them
um union benefits like Health Care

273
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.100
Health Care coverage and so yeah they do
pay more in Sag than they make a year

274
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.740
from acting because it's it's worth it
for the HealthCare coverage

275
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.000
and with the strike but I'm also worried
about how this will affect has been

276
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.400
Hotel
I am not a hundred percent sure if

277
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.820
um the voice again I think voice actors
people who do specifically voice acting

278
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.880
may I don't think they're in the loop
with sag I might be wrong

279
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.179
um
but I also think has been hotel is

280
00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:06.840
because it's a smaller production I
think most of the cast probably isn't

281
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.200
Union
um so it might not affect has been hotel

282
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.679
at all

283
00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:21.179
here in Atlanta with all the film work
there's lots of day players that make no

284
00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:25.860
real money a lot of casting agencies
charge to get in a movie

285
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.360
what
oh my God that's so scuzzy that's like

286
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.299
charging for auditions

287
00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:44.600
which I have seen done before

288
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:55.220
there would be uh agencies that would
charge you to let you audition for them

289
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.440
I saw on Twitter voice actors were
protesting AI using their voice good

290
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.419
good every every uh like I have it's
it's it's rough because like when you're

291
00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:10.380
on strike you're not getting paid
um

292
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.720
but you know it's the writers went on
strike and the executives were like we

293
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.960
don't need writers we banked so many
scripts during the pandemic we're fine

294
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.679
and now that the actors are on strike
they're actually hurting

295
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:30.179
like you had
uh

296
00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:36.360
oh God what did Ryan Murphy's
threatening to sue the union because

297
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.559
it's shutting down his
shows I'm like you're a billionaire you

298
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:45.240
are a billionaire because of your
Netflix deal you are obscenely rich

299
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:52.200
don't don't even don't even
uh and then Bob Iger saying like oh he's

300
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.220
disturbed by the fact that they're going
on strike at such an inopportune time

301
00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.480
it's like yeah strikes are supposed to
be painful for the executives that's

302
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.500
that's the point if you strike when it's
convenient it's not really going to work

303
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.940
chat gbt and AI is changing everything
it's and it's it's like

304
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:28.140
it is the idea of AI is beloved by
executive level people because they're

305
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:33.299
like we're gonna save so much money what
they don't realize is that at some point

306
00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:39.539
when you replace enough people with
robots and they're no longer paid

307
00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:43.220
they're gonna come cut your head off

308
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.700
and the rip the Millionaires and
billionaires do not seem to to have

309
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.840
grasped that yet they need to pick up a
history book and they need to read about

310
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.900
some of the revolutions that have
happened where the rich get their heads

311
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.520
cut off because it happens and it hasn't
happened in a while and so we're kind of

312
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.299
due for one and now is not the time to
put your neck out on the line

313
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.480
chat EBT and AI make worse shows and
execs are trying to see what level of

314
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.700
terrible will Ex we'll accept as
entertainment honestly like I have I've

315
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.100
read some scripts that are that have
been produced by Ai and I'm like

316
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.400
is this really the quality that they
want to go with

317
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.380
really
like you know Blockbuster The Fast and

318
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:43.799
Furious movies aren't exactly you know
great works of screenwriting but these

319
00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:48.000
scripts that I've read make them look
like they were written by

320
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.500
like Oliver Stone or something

321
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.600
did you know Ryan Murphy not only didn't
stop his Productions he also tried yeah

322
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.220
well he he does have to stop his
Productions because the ACT because sag

323
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.419
is on strike
um he didn't stop for the writer's Guild

324
00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:09.840
but he does have to stop for the Screen
Actors Guild

325
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.419
um
and yeah he does want to sue the

326
00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:16.740
writer's Guild and it's just like that's
a bad look Ryan

327
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.600
it's a really bad look
it's a bad look sir

328
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.600
it's I tweeted out today like between
Ryan Murphy and and and Bob Iger just

329
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.059
the two of them looking like absolute
 right now and taking up all of

330
00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:37.799
the news about like okay rich white men
looking like it's like David

331
00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:42.600
zazlov should send them both like a
bouquet of candy or something for taking

332
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.919
the heat off of him for a minute

333
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.580
YouTube reviewers are getting accused of
using chat EBT to pump out videos I

334
00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:01.260
wouldn't be surprised
I wouldn't be surprised actually

335
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.919
because it can just pull information
from the internet and if like you're

336
00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.320
just reviewing a movie that just came
out

337
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:14.659
and you want it out fast you can use
chat EBT to spit 500 Words out at you

338
00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:22.020
SAS love is the most make nothing to
make money exact in Hollywood

339
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.279
he's
he's he should be arrested I'm sure he's

340
00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:33.080
done something like actually illegal
someone should look into it

341
00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:42.720
a lot of YouTube is foreign house doing
chat GPT and automated I hate the

342
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.620
automated voice over so much like I
click on a video and I'm like oh this

343
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.700
has like half a million views this looks
interesting and I click on it

344
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:57.659
and then in comes the automated AI voice
reading lines not well written lines and

345
00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:03.240
I'm like me I'm like it is not
difficult to record voice over

346
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.480
like
come on

347
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:13.559
if you have the script just read it
it oh my God the the automated voices

348
00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:19.039
they oh they make me want to pull my
hair out

349
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.480
remember we had Irving thalberg and old
Hollywood producer that respected

350
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:33.679
writers I well I'm not really a
Hollywood producer but I respect writers

351
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.080
YouTube videos with automated voices are
pretty jarring they're horrible they're

352
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.840
horrible
especially when there's somebody putting

353
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.840
these videos together just just read the
script yourself

354
00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:55.020
if you ever wanted to go to Bear Week in
Provincetown just got back from there

355
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.460
it's so fun
um I'm not really I don't really could

356
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.640
um
I could identify as a bear I guess

357
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.980
that's such a weird sentence
um

358
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.120
but um also it's in the United States
I'm in Canada and I don't have a

359
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.679
passport so I wouldn't be able to go
even if I even if I did

360
00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:18.860
foreign

361
00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:27.240
are you a bear or I'm an otter in
training I haven't lost the weight to

362
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:33.980
officially be considered an otter yet
but I hopefully will get there

363
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.720
what is the p-town equivalent in Canada
we really don't have one Canada doesn't

364
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.760
have any kind of resort areas really
um that I know of like there's Prince

365
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.620
Edward Island that but that's a whole
Province and it's not really for when

366
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.700
the gays it's not really yeah I can't
really think of anything that's like

367
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.919
p-town or uh Fire Island or anything
like that any kind of version of that in

368
00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:01.100
Canada

369
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:13.320
uh Banff does have a big ski resort but
I can't imagine the gays going somewhere

370
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.860
it's cold

371
00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:28.740
the last surprise artist for Barbie the
album is Sam Smith thoughts on that

372
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.640
well we all know I'm not a fan of Sam
Smith and I have not been a fan of them

373
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.880
for quite some time
um

374
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.640
so makes me a bit sad
that they didn't get like I don't know

375
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.559
Lady Gaga or someone somebody fun

376
00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:53.519
assuming the automated voices are
reading reading languages the video

377
00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:57.419
producers don't speak put your auto
script through Auto translate and feed

378
00:33:57.419 --> 00:34:00.899
it to the robot
I never thought of that still though

379
00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:04.740
still though
hey James which do you prefer popping

380
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.679
pimples or reabsorbing
I never pop pimples

381
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:16.260
uh popping pimples leave scars
um so as you can see right here and

382
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.760
right here
there he and also up here

383
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.119
um there are pimples and they are going
to eventually go away and I just

384
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:32.359
I just use moisturizer and hope for the
best

385
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:42.659
have you seen the trailer for red white
and royal blue I have and I I had no I

386
00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:46.560
really wasn't excited for the movie like
I loved the book I legitimately loved

387
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.520
the book but I wasn't excited for the
movie at all because they released the

388
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.399
um pictures of the actors when they
first announced the casting and I was

389
00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:56.159
like they're too pretty they're too
pretty I feel no connection to these

390
00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:00.540
people I I just I can't
but then the trailer came out and I was

391
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.880
like
okay those were model photos they do

392
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.859
look like real people and
I'm really excited for it I can't wait

393
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:15.119
to watch it
I honestly there's it's got so much

394
00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:18.420
attention online and so many views I
wish it was being released in theaters

395
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.440
because I feel like it would actually do
well

396
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.619
um

397
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.000
and you know having a gay movie that
actually does well would be nice

398
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.380
any thoughts on nimona I'm not
spoilering yeah Nick and I actually

399
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.540
recorded a whole podcast uh about our
thoughts on nimona uh that's on the

400
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.079
patreon

401
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.240
what do you think about Madonna's kids
having to do

402
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.619
an interventions saying she's not 20
anymore and she has to slow down and cut

403
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:56.160
out the surgery
I didn't I didn't I didn't know that was

404
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.520
happening

405
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:06.380
okay he's in the cold just make me think
the other side of Aspen

406
00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:15.119
I had to watch the for my making a big
documentary I had to I had to watch the

407
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:19.920
other side of Aspen so many times
Interview with the Vampire not being

408
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:26.640
nominated for any any Emmett any Emmys
is a crime like Sam deserved that Emmy

409
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.680
I'm not surprised he didn't get
nominated the Emmys usually don't go for

410
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.740
um

411
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.460
gay stuff really

412
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.220
you mentioned on Twitter a video on the
BL industry and I was wondering if

413
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.740
you've caught wind of the
toku to BL pipeline present in many Jeff

414
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.500
I'm not sure what toku means

415
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.740
I was really happy that the Fire Island
got nominated I think it's got two

416
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.060
nominations I think
um

417
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.660
and uh
I was really happy to see that it got

418
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.079
nominated

419
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.079
did you see the tweet that the guy who
played Mac from Always Sunny basically

420
00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:26.700
came out as on the Spectrum uh no I've
actually never I've only watched a

421
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.839
couple of episodes of only Sunny uh and
it's been a it's it's like it's

422
00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:35.060
something I can't watch now because
there's too much of it

423
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.119
laughs

424
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.560
Have you listened to what was I made for
by Billy eilish a song for the Barbie

425
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.839
soundtrack no I haven't listened to I I
like never listen to new music it's rare

426
00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:01.280
that I end up listening to new music

427
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:20.160
tokasatu Japanese Power Rangers Oh I
thought that was like I thought that was

428
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.760
super Sentai

429
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:33.320
I hope Billy Eichner is pissed
I really hope he is

430
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:44.099
if you read Fire Punch very depressing
very good uh no I have I've never heard

431
00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:50.119
of Fire Punch
Super Sentai is an example okay

432
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:57.780
I mean it makes sense because BL is like
super super popular in

433
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.760
um in in basically almost well all of
Asia I was gonna say except China but

434
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.540
it's also really popular in China it's
just that you know they basically

435
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.079
stopped before the kiss happens
um

436
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:13.980
and it's really really popular like all
over Asia

437
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.359
um so I'm not surprised that there's
kind of a a pipeline going from one

438
00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:23.240
genre of Japanese media to another

439
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.640
I saw the first season of the boys but I
haven't seen the rest of it

440
00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:51.900
many actors go from here to play VL
actors in it really I didn't know that

441
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.380
I mean I I guess I kind of assumed
because I know a lot of Australian

442
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.220
actors do that

443
00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:14.160
when will the strike end
I'm worried about how these rich people

444
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.700
are going to use them and then spit them
out like nothing

445
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.579
I think this strike is going to go on
for a while

446
00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:25.560
because the thing is there's one side of
the strike the actors and the writers

447
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.339
who are literally fighting for their
life

448
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:36.180
um if the executives get what they want
actors and writers will not be able to

449
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.380
work anymore they will not be able to
come close to making a living

450
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.640
on acting and writing actors already the
majority of actors already can't

451
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.480
and so it's like and these are working
actors

452
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.579
uh people who are employed and they
can't make a living uh same thing with

453
00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:56.579
the writers
and so they're literally fighting for

454
00:40:56.579 --> 00:41:00.720
their lives
and then there are executives

455
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.200
who
they just they just want them they're

456
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.320
just greedy as
and so I think this is going to last a

457
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.280
really long time I wouldn't be surprised
if it lasts to the point where a

458
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.020
government mediator has to come in and
actually like force them to come to uh

459
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.040
uh an agreement

460
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.380
wasn't that the exact plan to wait them
out until they lose houses apparently

461
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.900
but the thing is is that now the stock
now that the actors are on Style

462
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.280
now that the actors are on strike and
production has actually shut down across

463
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.900
the board uh not completely across the
board some things that are shooting

464
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.500
um overseas in Europe haven't had to
shut down

465
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.220
um
but like the vast majority of movies and

466
00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.240
TV shows have shut down production
because the actors are on strike

467
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.180
um
it's costing the studios 30 million

468
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.920
dollars a day
for this strike and because of that

469
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.540
uh their stock has dropped
and when the stock drops Studio

470
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.380
Executives lose money because most of
their wealth is held in stock options

471
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.880
that they have in the companies and so
the if they were smart

472
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.359
they would make a deal
if they were smart they would honestly

473
00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:29.579
give the writers and the actors
everything they want because they

474
00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:35.220
um
it's minuscule compared to like the

475
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.200
money that comes in it it's minuscule
it's literally executive saying I don't

476
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.820
want to pay you this because I don't
think I should have to you are you know

477
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:50.160
it's like the CEO of McDonald's looking
at a at a a cashier they're like you are

478
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.339
an aunt I shouldn't have to pay you
anything more you should do this for

479
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:55.740
free
um

480
00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:00.960
and so that's the problem but it's gonna
hurt their it's going to hurt their own

481
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.260
wallets the executive's wallets are
being hurt because of the stocks drop

482
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.760
the stock dropping so
hopefully that will uh force them to the

483
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:16.560
negotiating table and uh if not they
have

484
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:22.020
discuss something is happening that I
don't think they expected to happen

485
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:27.420
and that is that uh the really rich
actors the Leonardo DiCaprio's the Marco

486
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.619
robies
have actually started paying

487
00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:37.319
giving money
to the actors and the writers who like

488
00:43:37.319 --> 00:43:42.780
can't afford the strike
and that means that it's going to be

489
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:47.640
able to last a very long time and the
longer it goes the more it will hurt

490
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.280
executives
so

491
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:58.500
how much does their personal Pride
matter to them that's going to be the

492
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.460
the the question

493
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.000
how last how long was the last writer's
strike multiple months if I remember

494
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.599
correctly yeah the last writer strike
was in 2006 or 2008 I think it was 2008.

495
00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:23.640
uh that lasted a couple of months but
the last time the writers and the actors

496
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:29.880
both strike striked struck
went on strike at the exact same time

497
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.960
was in 1960 and it helped destroy the
studio system it completely rewrote the

498
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.960
way Hollywood existed and I think that's
going to happen again

499
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.440
I just found out I have to use a VPN to
watch Troye sivan's music video because

500
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.200
we have the censored version what the

501
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:08.280
recently learned same-sex marriage is
illegal in Japan and East Asia yet it's

502
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:13.440
common for sex change to be covered as
being non-binary is more of a threat to

503
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.440
their Collective conservatism it's not
uh same-sex marriage isn't like across

504
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.260
the board illegal it's actually illegal
in multiple prefectures in Japan

505
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.720
uh I think it may actually be becoming
legal by court order I can't remember uh

506
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.440
but I think I think but I might be wrong
but I know it is legal in multiple

507
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.900
prefectures in Japan uh same with a lot
of Asia it's like not legal Countrywide

508
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.940
but in sections of the country it is

509
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:56.000
core but unspoken element in the lead up
to the strike has been the Nationwide

510
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.540
hike in rents in the U.S not widely
known but after the coveted crisis drove

511
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.099
up wages we had a brief economic surge
then all major commercial property

512
00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:09.660
corporations hiked rents as much as 50
in some cases this crashed the economy

513
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.220
and still has the U.S struggling
but people living in very large Metro

514
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:19.020
areas with High property values are
suffering the worst sag members are not

515
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.520
joking about Mass poverty driving them
almost out of business yeah and so

516
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.500
that's one of the things that's actually
happening now is um

517
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.819
because so many places are
um

518
00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:36.960
so many companies are staying remote and
they're not going back to the office a

519
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.760
lot of office rental companies are like
begging for a bailout

520
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.200
because
they're like oh my God our the offices

521
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.760
we were charging you know tens of
thousands of dollars a month for oh

522
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.140
they're empty now because people are
working from home

523
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.940
and you know they could turn them into
affordable apartments that people could

524
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.839
rent and then they would be making some
money better than no money right but no

525
00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:06.440
they won't do that

526
00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:11.700
huge question I know but that's a
fascinating point about the destruction

527
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.079
of the studio system
what do you see as rising in its place

528
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:20.220
well basically what happened was there
was the movies there was the studio

529
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.420
system where people were locked into
contracts people were

530
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:29.760
um you know if someone wanted to work
for fox and Disney they had to uh and

531
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.420
but they were under contract with Fox
they had to get permission from Fox to

532
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.619
do it and then Fox got a permission of
their pay or a portion of their paycheck

533
00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:42.420
stuff like that that collapsed
um

534
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.500
uh
what will happen now I think and

535
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.960
honestly this and and also what came out
of that was movies became much more

536
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.540
writer driven
because writers got an increase in pay

537
00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:03.119
and so Studios kind of started expecting
okay we want higher quality stuff and so

538
00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:09.300
the big giant biblical extravaganzas of
these of the 50s the early 60s died off

539
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.099
and were replaced by things like The
Graduate and whatever happened to Baby

540
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:17.359
Jane and
um

541
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:21.660
uh who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and
stuff like that things that were very

542
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.079
screenplay driven
um

543
00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:28.980
which also meant that they were much
cheaper to make and I'm honestly I'm

544
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.240
hoping that that happens because
we've seen multiple times this summer

545
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:39.619
with movies like The Flash and uh even
Fast and the Furious Indiana Jones

546
00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:46.200
that movies are becoming so expensive
that it's a bubble and it's about to pop

547
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.680
and I think this strike is going to pop
that bubble and movies are going to go

548
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:56.040
back down to an to a normal
ranged budget like somewhere around the

549
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.400
100 million range
and

550
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.960
be more focused on character and script
and less focused on spectacle and then

551
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.020
once every couple of months a big
spectacle movie will come out and then

552
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.700
that will be the big spectacle movie for
the year uh you know it will be the Lord

553
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.460
of the Rings The Return of the King for
the year

554
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:20.099
uh instead of every two weeks there
being a new Lord of the Rings style

555
00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:23.060
sized movie

556
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.560
I feel like Disney is getting too big I
would assume this strike will have an

557
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.160
exponential effect like you said every
day is costing them dearly yeah 30

558
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.940
million dollars a day
30 million dollars a day

559
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.920
in 10 days they will spend they will
lose more money than they would if they

560
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.500
sign if they said yes to every Union
agreement

561
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.380
if they gave in to every demand from the
unions

562
00:49:54.599 --> 00:49:59.579
they they will lose more money in 10
days than if they gave in to every Union

563
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:03.740
um demand it will cost them more money

564
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.880
but they are old rich white men and they
have pride and it's not their money

565
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.400
they're spending they're spending the
studios money they're not spending their

566
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.579
money

567
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:34.680
uh who does the fine go to which which
fine is that

568
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.079
it's that truth of Indy
was that it's perfect

569
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:44.280
for my age group you remember Ford at
his best but Gen X is old and people

570
00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.460
under 40 don't want to watch a retiree
in an action movie

571
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.400
I think the higher ups really want to
have the option to use AI to get more

572
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.700
money so the opportunity cost they're
seeing probably is more well yeah

573
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.859
they're looking at it as we can over the
next decade we could save so much money

574
00:51:07.859 --> 00:51:11.640
by not having to hire writers to write a
script because

575
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.599
really when you write a screenplay
you're paid for the idea really you're

576
00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:20.220
not paid for the words on the page uh
you're paid for the idea they hire

577
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:25.140
writers all the time to rewrite scripts
and they get paid very very little

578
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.180
and they make that script like the the
movie that's actually released it's

579
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.160
basically like an outline that gets a
million dollars somebody gets paid a

580
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.980
million dollars for the outline and then
if someone gets paid twenty thousand

581
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:42.000
dollars to write the actual screenplay
that happens so often

582
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.359
um
and so they're like we can have ai

583
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:49.680
create the idea for us and then have
someone come and write the script and

584
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.579
then it only costs 20 000 instead of a
million

585
00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:59.280
and that's what they're thinking is that
in the long run it will save them money

586
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:05.300
um what they don't seem to be taking
into account is that the studios look

587
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:11.940
horrible right now
anyone who's paying attention to AI is

588
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.700
scared that AI is going to take their
job

589
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:20.700
and the studios are the executives at
the Forefront saying yes we would like

590
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.140
to replace you with robots
and

591
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:29.480
they look horrible right now

592
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.780
who is a writer who's a Creator writer
director working now you'd love to see

593
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.260
get a chance to make a picture in this
new Hollywood

594
00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:47.400
um me um
uh but in

595
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.819
in reality uh that's a good question
actually

596
00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:52.880
um

597
00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:57.480
because the ones that I that I'm really
loving are they're already kind of doing

598
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.859
amazing work like Arya Astor uh the
Daniels like they're already doing

599
00:53:01.859 --> 00:53:07.280
amazing stuff
for very little money

600
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.710
why is this not an antitrust concern it
should be

601
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:21.559
[Music]
um

602
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:27.480
but that would involve the federal
government being useful and uh they have

603
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.339
not proven that they can do that

604
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.460
funny thing is that the tech Bros that
like AI are scared of the Terminator

605
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.300
style apocalypse happening oh yeah like
the the the people who actually

606
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.319
understand AI
and are like building it are kind of

607
00:53:49.319 --> 00:53:54.119
scared of it
and but these bonehead Executives who

608
00:53:54.119 --> 00:53:58.380
have a bachelor of Business
Administration agree they're like oh

609
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.280
yeah we can replace so many people with
robots and it's like

610
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.180
okay Hollywood
quick question

611
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.480
you replace
uh

612
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.260
your most of your actors and all of your
writers with robots

613
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.859
okay
uh what happens next Walmart's replaces

614
00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:21.059
all of their cashiers with you know
automated cashiers which they're already

615
00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:25.619
doing McDonald's is already doing that
um McDonald's figures out a way to have

616
00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:29.520
robots flipping burgers
okay

617
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.720
um
call centers disappear and just have you

618
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.380
know robots talking to you that's
already happening

619
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.180
um at what point
do people no longer have the money to go

620
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:48.119
see your movies
it will happen sooner rather than later

621
00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:51.960
and then what do you do
and then you're up shit's creek without

622
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:59.780
a paddle and it's just they have they
have it they have an inability to see

623
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:07.260
like Beyond a two-year window of time it
is shocking to me that CEOs the whole

624
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:13.619
idea of a CEO is someone who can look
like decades into the future for a

625
00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:17.220
business to try and make it succeed over
the long term that's the whole point of

626
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.180
a CEO
and it's it boggles my mind that there's

627
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:28.800
so many of them that are just so dense
that they can't see like past their the

628
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.780
next contract renegotiation

629
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:44.280
AI could easily replace politicians by
just telling it to make everything worse

630
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:50.640
CEOs could actually be replaced really
really really easily because

631
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.240
especially the way they work now all you
would have to do is have an accountant

632
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.339
input money or Inc input the financial
information into a program and then have

633
00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:04.260
the program make the decisions based
entirely on financial data and there you

634
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:10.800
just replace the CEO
save a lot of money doing that

635
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.240
CEOs are not creative people

636
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.520
the only they only see quarterly profits
now I blame Welch he started the current

637
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.140
trend of CEOs the worst part was that he
was lying about his numbers uh Jack

638
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:35.839
Welch I forget what he was the CEO of

639
00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:41.220
James check out my husband Mark Schultz
plays he's hilarious and devastating but

640
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.980
I am biased he's also my husband he's
not straight

641
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.640
CEOs were replaceable even before
computers

642
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:59.339
well yeah CEOs could easily be replaced
by uh uh you know the board of directors

643
00:56:59.339 --> 00:57:04.380
they could just vote on decisions
instead of having some

644
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:09.680
bonehead with a business degree pretend
like he knows what he's doing

645
00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:19.280
General Electric oh yeah yeah that's it
I remember jokes about him on 30 Rock

646
00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:32.400
I worked at Home Depot during the
nardelli days it was horrible all smoke

647
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.079
and mirrors almost destroyed the company

648
00:57:43.819 --> 00:57:48.440
150 year old company just gone because
of him

649
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:56.839
I'm just reminded of like there's so so
many companies that are like

650
00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:02.640
just they're just so badly run like huh
what do you think about a CGI and video

651
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:07.980
game Union they there absolutely needs
to be a you I think uh video game people

652
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:14.000
who work on video games and and the
um

653
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.480
um digital artists who work on movies
they should form a union together so

654
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:24.180
that they are a massive Union
and that way they can't be with

655
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:28.020
because special effects artists and
people who work on video games

656
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.760
they are exploited so badly right now
they're paid a salary they're not paid a

657
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:37.859
year a yearly an hourly wage they're
paid a salary and they are expected to

658
00:58:37.859 --> 00:58:44.339
just work insane hours until until uh a
movie or a video game is done and they

659
00:58:44.339 --> 00:58:48.000
absolutely need a union I think everyone
needs a union I think that there should

660
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.339
be a general Union that is kind of
mandated by the federal government that

661
00:58:53.339 --> 00:58:56.299
anybody
any any

662
00:58:56.299 --> 00:59:04.140
that anyone can join
like that uh a Starbucks location can

663
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.140
just instead of being like should we
unionize or shouldn't we unionize they

664
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.440
should just be able to join this giant
Union

665
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.559
it's because they came up during the
Reagan Era and most were Libertarians so

666
00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:30.660
they didn't see the need to unionize
yeah

667
00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:33.839
yeah with the failure of the Indiana
Jones film and the success of the

668
00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:37.920
Insidious film do you think there are
too many big Blockbuster films and do we

669
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.160
need more lower budget films instead for
a while absolutely I think there should

670
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.480
be one big I think as far as the 200
million dollar Plus movies there should

671
00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.220
be one every three months

672
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.099
that's it

673
00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:59.579
that gives time first of all it gives
time for them to have you know staying

674
00:59:59.579 --> 01:00:03.000
power and if it's good people will go
see it for three months like Titanic

675
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.740
back in 1997 and eight
um gone with the win back in the 30s and

676
01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.140
40s
um

677
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.040
you know give the movie time to breathe
instead of like okay if you don't make

678
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.819
all your money back in the first weekend
you're screwed

679
01:00:17.819 --> 01:00:24.020
um and it gives room for the medium
sized movie to come back

680
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:35.579
I I completely agree Jared a24 is like
a24 is the model of what I think

681
01:00:35.579 --> 01:00:38.940
Hollywood should aim for
[Music]

682
01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:42.540
um
just you know throwing in a couple of

683
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:47.819
really big movies every year but I just
a couple of big movies not like this

684
01:00:47.819 --> 01:00:51.420
summer there's a 300 million dollar
movie coming out every week

685
01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.900
it's like Barbie has a 140 million
dollar budget and it seems like it's

686
01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.799
like reasonably low budget compared to
everything else that's coming out

687
01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:12.960
this might sound odd but as a dishwasher
even I'm scared that my job will no

688
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.220
longer exist due to robots

689
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.040
it's like who has the time or money for
yeah like I I love going to the movies I

690
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.220
sitting in a theater with people and
experiencing something is one of the my

691
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.880
favorite things it's it's one of the
reasons I want to make movies because I

692
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.940
think it's a really it can be a really
special kind of experience but even I

693
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:46.760
don't want to go every weekend to see
some kind of gigantic

694
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.240
explosion Fest

695
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:59.240
uh everything everywhere all at once
cost 35 million dollars I think

696
01:02:09.079 --> 01:02:13.220
uh 25 million dollars

697
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:23.520
uh 25 million so yeah so for a quarter
of a for 25 million dollars

698
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.640
it was
and first of all an amazing movie

699
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.040
and
second of all

700
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:40.260
with 25 million dollars
it then went on to make 141 million

701
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.380
dollars
that's a hell of a return on an

702
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:50.220
investment that's called profit that's
called bonuses that is money

703
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:55.020
no one's getting a bonus for the Flash
well I'm sure David zazov will give

704
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.359
himself a bonus but nobody should be
getting a bonus for the Flash

705
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.880
only like watching movies in theaters
with friends when no one is free there's

706
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.819
no reason to go I actually really like
going to the movies alone

707
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.880
I live like five minutes away from a
movie theater but I haven't been going

708
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.079
and I don't know why

709
01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:24.380
I'm going twice next weekend to see
Barbie and Oppenheimer

710
01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:28.160
excuse me

711
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.680
naive Nelly Here do you think with AI
taking all the jobs we will ever reach

712
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.000
that Star Trek post-currency future
uh we'll have to kill all the rich

713
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.540
people first

714
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.760
I know that's that's dark and Grim but
it's gonna have to happen in order to

715
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.700
actually
get to there

716
01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:59.520
Chris there was no reason to see the
flash like it's there's it's like even

717
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.079
if the flash had made a ton of money
there's no Flash 2 there's no extension

718
01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:08.520
going on in that part of the DC Universe
and I don't think anyone's gonna go see

719
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.119
Blue Beetle either when that comes out
because it's the same deal

720
01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:22.500
did they really kill the rich in Star
Trek I know nothing about Star Trek did

721
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.099
that really happen

722
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.740
I'm not saying we should do what the
french did during the French Revolution

723
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.660
and put rich people in their place
I am

724
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.880
only one we only have to do one we can
pick a really really shitty one

725
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.460
like Elon musker or Rupert Murdoch or
some someone no Rupert Murdoch's too old

726
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:57.420
it won't really Elon Musk let's focus on
a real a really rich

727
01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:02.880
and if we you know
do a French Revolution to just one of

728
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.480
them
and show them that you're not safe

729
01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:16.640
don't need to Kill Them All
no Mark Zuckerberg's not horrible

730
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.819
I feel bad that people hate Mark
Zuckerberg so much I don't I don't think

731
01:05:20.819 --> 01:05:26.099
he's a bad person
I think he is severely disconnected from

732
01:05:26.099 --> 01:05:30.260
average people but I don't think he's a
bad person

733
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.579
I went to see Wes Anderson's newest film
before I saw a trailer for the

734
01:05:41.579 --> 01:05:45.720
Transformers movie Blue Beetle and two
others and they all looked the same uh I

735
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.859
was so excited for the new Transformers
movies because like I loved Beast Wars

736
01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:54.780
when I was a kid
but I haven't and I I loved um

737
01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:00.059
Unicron from the original Transformers
movie but I haven't actually seen it

738
01:06:00.059 --> 01:06:04.339
I loved bumblebee though bumblebee was a
lot of fun

739
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.940
I think it's possible to be a
billionaire not a bad person nope

740
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:13.619
you can be a millionaire
and be a and be a good person because

741
01:06:13.619 --> 01:06:18.660
you can become a millionaire by being an
artist by coming up with an idea you

742
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:23.359
cannot become a billionaire without
hurting someone along the way it is

743
01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:29.299
impossible to become a billionaire
without hurting somebody along the way

744
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.020
oh I did Zuckerberg's a like he's a
billionaire so he has hurt people people

745
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.640
are dead because of Mark Zuckerberg
um

746
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.960
but I think people have a people seem to
hate him because he isn't personable

747
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.119
and I don't like that I don't I don't
like to like people seem to focus that

748
01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:58.799
like he acts weird it's like yeah he's
on the Spectrum he's not the most

749
01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:01.559
personable guy
um

750
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.799
but apparently like he's really nice to
his kids and he's really nice to his

751
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:10.500
wife and everything and you know
you know there there is no good

752
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.480
billionaire but there are levels of bad

753
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.380
well people who use Facebook are stupid
no I'm sure there's lots of lots of

754
01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:29.839
smart people who you still use Facebook
they they they banned me for some reason

755
01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:39.900
we'd have to do at least three a week
for Rich Americans to actually take it

756
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.380
seriously

757
01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:46.260
I think we could find three a
week to do I think I think that's

758
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.680
possible

759
01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.260
James you have an account on letterbox
or other social media about Cinema if

760
01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.440
not do you
keep track of the movies you watch in

761
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.960
any way I do have a letterboxed account
but I never remember that it exists

762
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.859
um
I never think of letterbox

763
01:08:13.859 --> 01:08:18.319
um
and I don't really

764
01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:23.880
the only way I really keep track of the
movies I watch is uh I almost

765
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.520
universally buy physical media I almost
never stream movies unless it's required

766
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.199
like if it's on Netflix or something
um

767
01:08:34.199 --> 01:08:38.940
and uh
so it's like if the movie is on my shelf

768
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.500
that's how I can track it

769
01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:50.719
how do you hook up with people for sex
if it were not for Facebook Marketplace

770
01:08:51.739 --> 01:08:57.000
well I uh
I never really hook up with anybody so

771
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.900
that explains that

772
01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.179
I've been searching for viable social
media Beyond Facebook and Twitter any

773
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:11.400
recommendations uh well there's threads
but that's just a basically Twitter

774
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.259
clone made by Facebook uh though I do
like threads better than Facebook it

775
01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:21.420
seems like they keep the at
Bay on threads better than Twitter does

776
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:27.299
um
blue sky but that you need an invite to

777
01:09:27.299 --> 01:09:31.640
get onto Blue Sky
uh

778
01:09:34.739 --> 01:09:40.980
the uh
James Summerton Channel Discord

779
01:09:44.219 --> 01:09:47.940
love that you have become Katniss and
are now trying to figure out which rich

780
01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.620
person to revolt against President Snow
Elon Musk or however was the head of the

781
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.460
resistance in the book

782
01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.520
oh yeah let's just grab all the
conservatives on the Supreme Court and

783
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.360
do one of them a week

784
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:11.460
Blue Sky did lose a huge opportunity
huge I actually got an invite to Blue

785
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.880
Sky I am on Blue Sky
um

786
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.620
but yeah they
I don't know if they were trying to make

787
01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:25.140
it feel exclusive or if they were just
trying to work out the bugs but they

788
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.320
waited too long and now threads has just
completely taken the air out of it

789
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.739
I'm also on Tumblr I've been using
Tumblr a bit more lately

790
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.780
what's one thing you find weird about
Americans mine is the glorification of

791
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:53.100
politicians this might sound Grim but if
you think people in places

792
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:58.620
of care
power care about you then you need to

793
01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:02.820
think hello from Mexico hello from mix
from Canada

794
01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:08.699
um I think Americans obsession with guns
is just really really weird

795
01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:13.500
really weird and also there's sort of
deification of politicians because it

796
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:18.000
does happen like on the left and the
right there's sort of a like they look

797
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.260
at like
certain politicians as just like like

798
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:27.960
there's a joke that Republicans have
Saint Reagan like that they look at

799
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.500
Ronald Reagan as a saint
um

800
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.980
I mean it's kind of true I've talked to
some Republicans who are um

801
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.860
joining individual discords for things
I'm interested in seem to have been a

802
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.440
much better alternative to regular
socials

803
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.540
I'm actually not on a bunch of discords
I think I'm only on like three

804
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.640
um and I think they're all mine
when's the patreon Discord one's the

805
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.219
channel Discord and one's the Telos
pictures Discord

806
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.040
I haven't watched them yet ephemera

807
01:12:15.659 --> 01:12:22.040
Michael that movie is actually not a hit
um the studio that is Distributing it

808
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.699
actually bought most of the tickets that
were sold

809
01:12:26.699 --> 01:12:31.880
uh so it looks like it's a success but
it's actually not

810
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.540
we're guilty as charged us here and
spent years trying to talk friends off

811
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.640
of the personality Cults never seems to
work

812
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:54.420
yeah the class the conservative actually
do that a lot like conservatives when

813
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.719
when a conservative especially
conservative politicians when they

814
01:12:57.719 --> 01:13:01.500
publish a book they need it to go on the
New York Times bestseller list and so

815
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.480
they send people around to all the
bookstores in New York to buy up all the

816
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.900
copies and then they just like sit them
in a warehouse

817
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.620
and the New York Times kind of caught on
to this and now there's actually a

818
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.719
little like asterisk that they put
beside books that had that most of the

819
01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:23.100
sales were from bulk sales because
conservative politicians and like

820
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.659
conservative think peace people uh were
doing it so often that they had to say

821
01:13:27.659 --> 01:13:33.120
like this actually didn't sell
a hundred thousand copies in New York

822
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:40.020
City it
it's more like 20.

823
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.360
what's your comprehensive thoughts on
goths

824
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.080
I don't think I really have a
comprehensive thoughts on Goths I didn't

825
01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.460
even really know any in high school

826
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.659
I think I knew one
there's like one goth girl I knew in

827
01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:09.800
high school and that was about it

828
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.020
hurts down to Freedom is Q Anon movie is
that true uh I know nothing about it

829
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.699
except the box office nonsense

830
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.880
so when the whole theater is bought out
by people not even in attendance do they

831
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.260
still roll the film oh yeah they still
play it because there's like probably

832
01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:46.739
some people there because what they do
is they try to give the tickets away

833
01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:51.179
when they buy tickets for a movie they
and a lot of religious movies do this

834
01:14:51.179 --> 01:14:55.920
they'll buy whole theaters
out and they'll try and give it away and

835
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.620
sometimes they'll give it away to
members of their church and stuff like

836
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:04.699
that so people do show up but they
didn't buy the tickets the studio did

837
01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:16.820
of course it's backed by Steve Bannon

838
01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:34.520
the theaters for Captain Marvel were not
empty that was a conspiracy theory

839
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.620
it's Jim Caviezel from Passion of the
Christ so it's hyper Christian Ultra

840
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.880
conservative propaganda
he's all about how he's canceled since

841
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.780
passion
yeah he's canceled and he hasn't he's

842
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:54.060
reprising the role of Jesus in Mel
Gibson's next movie which is the passion

843
01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.800
too literally doing that uh I think it's
about when Jesus went to hell for three

844
01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.980
days

845
01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:08.159
wouldn't that technique not genuinely
make more sense than typical marketing

846
01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:14.280
well no because you're like if you spend
100 million dollars on marketing

847
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.440
uh let's let's do smaller numbers
um if you spend 10 million dollars on

848
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.620
marketing
um

849
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.520
then
you might get 10 million dollars worth

850
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.760
of tickets but you might get a hundred
million dollars worth of tickets

851
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.060
but if you spend 10 million dollars on
movie tickets you're just getting 10

852
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.540
million dollars in movie tickets
and you're only getting half of it back

853
01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.420
because the theater keeps half of it so
you're not even getting your investment

854
01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.659
back

855
01:16:51.179 --> 01:16:54.480
I'm pretty sure a sequel to Passion of
the Christ is considered heresy or

856
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.940
blasphemy one of those things
it's

857
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:03.719
technically you can do a sequel because
Jesus did go to hell for I think three

858
01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:06.600
days I think it's three days after the
crucifixion he went down to hell for

859
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.560
three days it's like mentioned in the
bible but I'm pretty sure Mel Gibson

860
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.640
wants to make a thing out of it
um but it's like mentioned it's not even

861
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.940
like described what happened when he was
down there

862
01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.440
um
honestly if Mel Gibson wanted to

863
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.300
like
do a blockbuster Jesus movie he would do

864
01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.960
like a
adaptation of the Book of Revelations of

865
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.900
course that was already tried with the
Left Behind movies and they failed

866
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.620
miserably

867
01:17:39.179 --> 01:17:43.880
yeah so I guess it's not even a sequel
It's a mid-cool

868
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.020
you can make a prequel of the passion
where everyone looks 20 years older for

869
01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.260
some reason

870
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.600
excuse me

871
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.540
they should make it they should make a
movie of The Gospel

872
01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:23.540
um the the
Judas gospel

873
01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.040
yeah Derek exactly they should they
should

874
01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.020
they should do the Apocrypha absolutely

875
01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:42.679
that's how you get some controversy

876
01:18:44.699 --> 01:18:49.620
what do you think about the queer
ultimatum show the dating show

877
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:58.219
with the the the one
with the all the lesbians that one

878
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.960
it's a dating show with the lesbians

879
01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.920
make a movie out of all of Jesus's
references to homosexuals best Silent

880
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.640
One tick tock
I've never I never do tick tocks but

881
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.380
maybe I should do that oh my God I
should do

882
01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.320
got left behind failed because of Kirk
Cameron Left Behind failed because it's

883
01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.080
based on a bunch of bad books I Tried
reading them they're badly written they

884
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.159
are not good good Lord I was so excited
because I was like obsessed with the end

885
01:19:35.159 --> 01:19:38.460
of the world when I was a teenager I was
a dark child

886
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.159
um
and I was like oh I want to read these

887
01:19:41.159 --> 01:19:45.140
and they were so bad

888
01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:54.440
I was like this this story you're trying
to tell is a Trilogy it's not 12 books

889
01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:04.800
I have the Sodom and Gomorrah retorts
down to a science I put conservatives

890
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.460
away on Twitter

891
01:20:15.719 --> 01:20:19.440
James just watched nimona and I thought
it was pretty cool I think it lacked

892
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.100
World building with a wall and some
other things but the art and animation

893
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:29.400
is very good it was too good
too too good to Disney maybe too good

894
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.460
for Disney
um

895
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:37.260
yeah like my my critique of it was that
maybe it like an extra 20 minutes would

896
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:41.040
have made it perfect
but it was so good that I I'm I'm not

897
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.980
even willing to nitpick it I think it's
just such a fun movie

898
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:58.679
like I didn't even going into watch it I
didn't even know that it had like gay

899
01:20:58.679 --> 01:21:01.920
characters or anything it was like oh my
God

900
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.100
foreign

901
01:21:05.159 --> 01:21:08.880
do you know what the next video is going
to be are you still on break uh well

902
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:14.460
break is uh working on a movie and
making videos for patrons

903
01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:21.780
um the next video is a patron a timed
Patron exclusive which means that it

904
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.659
will be coming out at the end of the
month for patrons and then sometime in

905
01:21:24.659 --> 01:21:30.120
the fall for YouTube and that one is
looking at good Omens and Sandman and

906
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.380
why a straight man
Neil Gaiman is so good at writing queer

907
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.560
characters
um and then after that there's going to

908
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:42.719
be another patreon video uh looking at
the sort of

909
01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:48.659
um
uh Magical Warrior women genre with like

910
01:21:48.659 --> 01:21:52.860
revolutionary girl Lieutenant Legend of
Korra Sailor Moon

911
01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:57.600
um
and then uh in September we have a video

912
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.260
for planned for September but I can't
remember what it is

913
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.679
um and that one's actually going to be
on YouTube but I can't remember what the

914
01:22:04.679 --> 01:22:07.159
video is

915
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.080
thank you I can't remember

916
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.040
oh Natasha I know I know I was there was
there was

917
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.219
oh
[Laughter]

918
01:22:23.219 --> 01:22:26.420
I'm so excited

919
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.900
really you were raised Catholic and
taught the Rapture I was raised Catholic

920
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:48.199
and we just we there was we never talked
about the rapture

921
01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:54.179
the nuns were
and as I was coming like of age it was

922
01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:58.140
right around 2000
and so the nuns were very focused on

923
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.400
Jesus returning in the year 2000 and
stuff which did not do well for me and

924
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.880
my bad anxiety
um but yeah they never mentioned the

925
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.820
Rapture or anything like that because
the Rapture I think is a is a very

926
01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:15.140
Protestant thing
because the Rapture is not in the Bible

927
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:28.040
when you strip away what was written
about Jesus

928
01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.719
most long after he died he did what most
Christians can't do he questions beliefs

929
01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:38.340
and publicly challenged the status quo
until he was killed yeah like I am very

930
01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:43.260
much of the opinion of um
you know if you want to be a Christian

931
01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:49.679
and believe the stuff that Jesus said
I think you're on a good footing

932
01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:53.940
I think you're pretty good
uh if you want to be a Christian and

933
01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:58.320
really only focus on the Old Testament
there's a reason most Jewish people look

934
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.239
at the Old Testament as Parables and not
stuff to not you know real life stories

935
01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:06.440
to live your life by

936
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:20.239
the coolest Nun Sister Denise
she was like rolling on ecstasy 24 7.

937
01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.600
neither are the seven deadly sins or the
nine circles of hell but a lot of

938
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.260
Catholics do believe in them yeah the
nine circles of hell that came from

939
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:42.179
Dante like the whole Paradise Lost and
all of that that all came from Dante

940
01:24:42.179 --> 01:24:46.020
like
and that was really just him writing

941
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:49.860
fan fiction for about the people he
admired

942
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.980
um

943
01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.080
it it's weird even the devil most of the
stuff about the devil is like fan

944
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.739
fiction it's not in the Bible there's
the devil is barely mentioned in the

945
01:25:01.739 --> 01:25:05.239
Bible
um

946
01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:10.500
and
it's it's it's it's funny how much

947
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:15.260
biblical fan fiction has made it into
the Canon

948
01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.540
my aunt and her husband are devout
Catholics which for them meant running a

949
01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:25.560
homeless shelter for 25 years and being
super humble so that's that's what

950
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.219
you're supposed to do that's what you're
supposed to do

951
01:25:29.219 --> 01:25:36.739
all right Paradise Lost was John Milton
uh The Divine Comedy was uh Dante right

952
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:45.000
nope the Rapture is not in the Bible
in the Book of Revelations everybody

953
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.780
just dies

954
01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:52.699
some seals get opened and bad
happens

955
01:25:57.239 --> 01:26:02.699
thoughts on Tom Holland's crowd that's
the new one where he's like I saw some

956
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:07.139
gifts he's like humping a dude I haven't
seen the trailer or the movie or

957
01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:14.280
anything like that but I'm uh
I'm glad that he's uh

958
01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.360
spreading his wings

959
01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.460
my priest never touched me drove me and
my friends to Gettysburg every summer

960
01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:31.880
and we'd listen to Star Wars on cassette
tape in his sports car

961
01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:41.580
oh yeah I've not just Inferno purgatorio
and a Paradisio it's all

962
01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:46.080
horrifying like all of it like even
Paradisio where it's like this is

963
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.020
supposed to be the happy place it's like
this is Nightmare fuel

964
01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:06.480
circles of hell are fanfic the snake in
the garden being the devil is fanfic

965
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.920
even the apple is fan fiction I think it
like it just says a fruit it doesn't say

966
01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.340
it's an apple

967
01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.719
are we talking about bayonet we
basically could be we could be talking

968
01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:27.739
about Bayonetta right now

969
01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:41.340
just joining in now I'm fascinated to
learn Christians have a version of

970
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:49.880
Ragnarok oh yeah Book of Revelations man
read it it's it's a trip

971
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.159
it's like there's a drag there's a seven
or an eight-headed Dragon I think it's a

972
01:27:56.159 --> 01:28:01.679
seven-headed dragon and
that rises out of the sea and then

973
01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:06.840
there's the the Beast and the Beast is
like a lion or something and all this

974
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.860
it's all an allegory for the fall of
Rome like it's it's none of it is

975
01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:14.940
prophecy it's all an allegory for the
fall of Rome but for some reason modern

976
01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.260
Christians started reading it
and by modern Christians I mean the last

977
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:23.659
couple of hundred years started reading
it as prophecy

978
01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:35.159
Revelation John discovers the happy
mushrooms exactly

979
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.620
there's actually quite a few dragons in
the Bible

980
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.639
sea monsters too

981
01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:53.760
I said at the end of the camera should
pan back and show the story on a movie

982
01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.480
screen in a theater

983
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.940
early days of the epidemic was a devout
Catholic and conservative but he somehow

984
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:16.560
managed to live by Jesus's teachings
I I have read of a lot of uh nuns in

985
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.260
particular uh who worked in Catholic
Hospitals that treat that treated AIDS

986
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.820
patients uh in the early days of the
epidemic and you know treated people

987
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:31.620
with dignity and respect
and I'm like wow

988
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.520
yeah Christians aren't horrible like I
was raised Catholic

989
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:40.500
never heard a homophobic word my entire
life like from my family and stuff never

990
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.739
not not even just about me just in
general

991
01:29:43.739 --> 01:29:48.179
like
I would not say that my family follows

992
01:29:48.179 --> 01:29:51.960
the teachings of Jesus by any means
um

993
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:59.780
but like there was never any like
hateful going around

994
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:07.679
too bad that red white and royal blue
don't get a press interviews during the

995
01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:10.620
strike
yeah

996
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.340
I well honestly they probably have some
filmed I wouldn't be surprised if they

997
01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.520
have some filmed
that's what happened

998
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.340
um Studios asked for a two-week it was
either a two-week or a 12 day extension

999
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:27.179
um to the agreements and sag thought
that was for them to come to the

1000
01:30:27.179 --> 01:30:31.800
negotiating table but it was actually so
that they could get a bunch of

1001
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.780
interviews and stuff filmed for press
before the strike happened because then

1002
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.320
the Press Outlets can air the interviews
without the actors actually having to do

1003
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.159
them during the strike

1004
01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:00.239
Charmander Squirtle or Bulbasaur ah
Squirtle I almost always go for the

1005
01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:02.659
water Pokemon

1006
01:31:15.179 --> 01:31:20.100
I sat through an entire lecture of the
unearthly love between David and his

1007
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.699
friend
yeah David and Jonathan is like the

1008
01:31:23.699 --> 01:31:27.540
first BL novel and it's in the Bible
Well it's not the first one that'd be

1009
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:31.320
like the I think that's the Epic of
Gilgamesh but like there's a BL novel

1010
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.820
hidden inside of the Bible

1011
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:56.639
did you choose crack uh no I don't think
I did actually

1012
01:31:56.639 --> 01:32:00.139
who did I choose that generation

1013
01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.760
um

1014
01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:16.820
no I chose uh fukoko in that generation

1015
01:32:27.239 --> 01:32:31.320
I never know Fran Drescher is now the
president of sag The Nanny put up a

1016
01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.520
strike I love all the gifts that are
going around where it's like yeah she

1017
01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.880
basically became Rich by making a show
where she annoyed a rich person

1018
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.440
kid's off topic but sometimes I forget
people

1019
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:58.560
still are on the satanic Panic thing
instead of aesthetic and fashion

1020
01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:04.080
there's so much satanic Panic being it's
being attached to like queer rights and

1021
01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.300
trans rights and stuff right now it's
it's it's it's it's so weird seeing this

1022
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:13.100
time warp back to the 1980s

1023
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:30.659
hahaha
this is cool I loved him in Final

1024
01:33:30.659 --> 01:33:33.380
Fantasy

1025
01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:41.100
showed up to Saint Sebastian for being
the twink icon of gay Antiquity for real

1026
01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:45.120
though
he was the first one to take an arrow to

1027
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.360
the knee
still waiting for the King David

1028
01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:54.000
Jonathan Bromance to hit the big screen
um there is a book called the prince's

1029
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.739
Psalm by Eric Shaw Quinn
and it is about the love story of David

1030
01:33:58.739 --> 01:34:03.320
and Jonathan and it should be made into
a movie

1031
01:34:04.199 --> 01:34:08.659
that could be that could bring the
biblical epic back

1032
01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.639
there's so much satanic Panic now I'm
surprised Jack Chick and his tracks

1033
01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:25.159
haven't made a comeback especially after
they made his movie

1034
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.860
oh
I have a sunburn on my legs and now

1035
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:32.460
they're itchy huh
there's a really homoerotic scene

1036
01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.360
Sebastian movie from I think the 70s I'm
trying to remember the name

1037
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:42.000
[Music]
is it the persecution of Saint Sebastian

1038
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.040
is that the one I think it's an Italian
movie

1039
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:54.960
somehow I think Magnus hirschfeld's got
a kind of movie worthy story

1040
01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.920
the problem with Magnus hirschfeld is I
feel like if someone made a movie about

1041
01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:03.020
him now the movie would get canceled
because he doesn't

1042
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:08.340
fit perfectly into the
uh

1043
01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:14.460
the mold
of what we accept as um politically

1044
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.820
correct

1045
01:35:21.179 --> 01:35:27.060
someone should reboot the story of Jesus
but as a gay cyberpunk novel series

1046
01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:32.760
it's like the the the series Nick and I
wanted to do about Jesus it's it's all

1047
01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.020
about Jesus and the disciples it's kind
of like it's shot like the office or

1048
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:42.000
Parks and Recreation and
like Jesus is always in the background

1049
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.360
he's never really the main character
it's all about these the disciples and

1050
01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.719
how they're all like oh I'm best friends
with Jesus but they're none of them are

1051
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:53.219
really best friends with Jesus and in
each episode Jesus would be played by

1052
01:35:53.219 --> 01:35:57.600
someone of a different ethnicity
um

1053
01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.580
and
uh I think like in the fight we had it

1054
01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.900
planned that in the final episode
um

1055
01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.639
that's when Jesus would finally be
played by someone like a middle eastern

1056
01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:15.840
person someone from the right area of
the world

1057
01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.420
um
like when he's actually on the cross and

1058
01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.600
stuff

1059
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:27.540
and I think we were gonna the different
ethnicities and genders like I think we

1060
01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:31.199
had Janelle Monae playing Jesus in one
episode

1061
01:36:31.199 --> 01:36:33.380
um

1062
01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:37.260
uh

1063
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.020
in the episode where Jesus is Asian we
wanted

1064
01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.920
um
um

1065
01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:51.440
um
oh damn it I forgot her name now damn it

1066
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.840
but yeah it was just like
all over the place

1067
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.040
Scarlett Johansson would absolutely Play
Jesus in one episode

1068
01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.990
can make grape juice from water
[Laughter]

1069
01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:35.300
Timothy chalamet is cyberpunk Jesus

1070
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:51.920
just picturing Brandon Rogers as Jesus
now

1071
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.239
oh my God

1072
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.780
oh God

1073
01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:09.600
who's an actor you really want to work
with uh there's a lot of actors I really

1074
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.239
that I really want to work with
um

1075
01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:21.780
uh Catherine O'Hara
I have a movie role written for

1076
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.500
Catherine O'Hara

1077
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:42.060
Wonka looks so weird wonky even
um

1078
01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:48.780
it's like I'm I'm wondering if they just
used the wrong shots in the trailer or

1079
01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.460
if
Timmy's performance is really all that

1080
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.900
over the place because sometimes he has
a Southern accent and I'm like maybe

1081
01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:01.739
it's like actually subversive and he's
actually like a total sociopath in the

1082
01:39:01.739 --> 01:39:07.260
movie kind of like Willy Wonka and
everything else and so he's kind of

1083
01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:12.179
putting on a performance for the people
who are around him at any given time and

1084
01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:16.800
I'm like maybe that's it maybe that's it
um

1085
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.659
but yeah I don't I don't know

1086
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:32.420
what was Nick's last name
last time I accidentally called

1087
01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:36.840
uh her God h-e-r-r-g-o-t-t

1088
01:39:43.199 --> 01:39:48.440
to me keeps dipping into Mumble core
vocal fries

1089
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:58.440
James what do you mean by Tom spreading
his wings well it looks like he's you

1090
01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:05.400
know playing a playing a a gag or
bisexual character

1091
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.460
um

1092
01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:14.120
which I am I'm very I I love that for
the Spider-Man

1093
01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:46.040
have you seen The Nair video I have

1094
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.320
who should Tom Holland play in Attack on
Titan ooh

1095
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.440
um

1096
01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.290
[Music]

1097
01:41:03.659 --> 01:41:09.440
Marco
Tom Holland should play Marco

1098
01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.760
it's me because

1099
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.100
uh Julie I I love the soundtrack I
haven't gotten to see it yet but I

1100
01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:28.159
actually have tickets to see it in
August and I'm really excited

1101
01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:33.020
foreign

1102
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.199
ER play in Attack on Titan
that's hard there's no characters that

1103
01:41:40.199 --> 01:41:46.440
kind of fit his age like he could be
um Reiner

1104
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.800
he could probably play Reiner that's the
only one I can think of

1105
01:41:59.699 --> 01:42:04.639
because these two like bulky to play
Armin

1106
01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:12.659
he's got such a still got such a baby
face I can't see him playing Reiner like

1107
01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:16.139
I don't know if he could play any like
Reiner's the only one I can think of but

1108
01:42:16.139 --> 01:42:19.820
I wouldn't cast him as as Reiner

1109
01:42:23.219 --> 01:42:27.960
I can't wait Julie it's actually the
first time I'm going to see a play Live

1110
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:33.060
it's the first time I've ever going to
see like Live Theater

1111
01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:37.580
um
I'm really I'm really excited

1112
01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:42.420
Who Would You cast as Aaron or Levi I
would actually cast Timothy chalameters

1113
01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:47.760
Aaron
um I'm not sure who I would cast as Levi

1114
01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.619
um
we got a Jason we got it backwards

1115
01:42:52.619 --> 01:42:56.820
um
Timmy might actually be good as Levi now

1116
01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.679
that now that because like he's got a
much quieter demeanor he's like yeah he

1117
01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:05.100
might be better for Levi
now that I think about it but Levi's in

1118
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:10.880
his late 30s
so Timmy's not old enough

1119
01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.219
uh Paul that would be lack of access I
grew up in a town well I grew up in a

1120
01:43:26.219 --> 01:43:32.100
place where there was no Live Theater
um

1121
01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:36.920
there wasn't even like touring companies
or anything like that

1122
01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.900
uh I grew up in Nova Scotia Canada

1123
01:44:05.159 --> 01:44:10.739
it almost was ephemera it almost was
last December I had tickets uh well I

1124
01:44:10.739 --> 01:44:15.960
was given tickets
to Cursed child but I was like

1125
01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:21.199
I cannot I
I can't

1126
01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.980
is too precious for Attack on Titan

1127
01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.000
oh
I saw cursed child when they cast

1128
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.020
non-binary performers in the leads they
made the queer reading

1129
01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:01.280
oh that's kind of cool

1130
01:45:06.659 --> 01:45:11.820
I actually I read the the cursed child
script

1131
01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.880
um

1132
01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.300
and I was like this is kind of a mess
but everyone said that it was great on

1133
01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:23.880
stage but by the time I had been given
the tickets it was well beyond the point

1134
01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.300
of no return with her so I was kind of
like no

1135
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.840
even though I didn't pay for the tickets
so I could have you know made the

1136
01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.219
argument that I am not supporting it
because I didn't pay for anything

1137
01:45:34.219 --> 01:45:38.760
but I am a weak person and I know I
would have left there with merchandise

1138
01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.360
so

1139
01:45:49.139 --> 01:45:52.760
calm down Michael calm down

1140
01:46:04.739 --> 01:46:09.719
uh Winters I used to watch a ton of
video essays but I haven't really been

1141
01:46:09.719 --> 01:46:13.940
watching them lately
um

1142
01:46:14.699 --> 01:46:19.380
a lot of times it's because they're too
long

1143
01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:25.320
it's like a very specific topic
and it's like

1144
01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:30.380
three hours long and I'm like no
um

1145
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.619
but the only
the only video essays I watch anymore

1146
01:46:34.619 --> 01:46:37.100
are

1147
01:46:37.679 --> 01:46:43.760
uh ask a mortician I've I still watch
their videos but that's about it

1148
01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:52.340
John Cena's Sasha

1149
01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:58.080
oh thank you van twinblade
I've been on a cruise for the last week

1150
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.060
we got back to Lauderdale we get back to
Lauderdale tomorrow morning then a 17

1151
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:10.400
hour drive home oh my God what about 200
in blackjack oh congratulations

1152
01:47:12.719 --> 01:47:16.679
I've always kind of wanted to go on a
cruise because I love the ocean but at

1153
01:47:16.679 --> 01:47:21.719
the same time I'm scared that it will
probably not sync cruise ships don't

1154
01:47:21.719 --> 01:47:25.619
usually sink but that there would be
some kind of

1155
01:47:25.619 --> 01:47:30.860
toilets backing up and
attacking me or something

1156
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.860
controversial opinion I don't think
Wiccan and hulkling will join the MCU

1157
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:46.040
together
he's straight but who's who's straight

1158
01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:52.500
I think they will both end up in the um
the MCU but I I don't think they'll be

1159
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:56.780
introduced together and I think they'll
only be on Disney Plus

1160
01:48:05.639 --> 01:48:10.260
uh Dan Olsen came for me when there was
a problem with my patreon and accused me

1161
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.960
of lying on Twitter so I'm not a fan of
Dan Olson anymore

1162
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:21.420
have you heard of the esoterica channel
yes I do watch them I do watch their

1163
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.659
videos

1164
01:48:48.659 --> 01:48:53.880
yeah I still I still watch
um hello future me's videos

1165
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.940
um

1166
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.020
I just haven't watched like video essays
in a while like even like

1167
01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:06.440
um
Rowan's videos like I've been so

1168
01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:11.100
distracted and and busy lately I haven't
had time to just sit down and watch

1169
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:17.820
anything that wasn't really that I don't
plan on making a video about and the

1170
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.400
other thing I always I always get
nervous watching other people's videos

1171
01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.639
especially stuff that about if they're
covering stuff I haven't made videos

1172
01:49:23.639 --> 01:49:27.960
about yet because I'm like
oh if I see it and then I want to make a

1173
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.780
video of it and then what if I repeat
what they say and stuff

1174
01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.900
I saw that mapa did that and I'm like
why are you doing this to me why are you

1175
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:44.880
teasing me with bringing banana fish
back into public light what are you

1176
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.980
doing what are you doing

1177
01:49:57.659 --> 01:50:00.920
are there any hobbies or interests you
will never be interested in getting into

1178
01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.520
but love watching other people geek out
about

1179
01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.580
um

1180
01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:13.560
it's not really a hobby but Star Trek
I'm not really interested in like

1181
01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:17.460
watching Star Trek but I love people
geek watching people geek out about it

1182
01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:21.360
and even watching videos about Star Trek
and the history of Star Trek and stuff

1183
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.000
but I have like no interest in actually
watching it

1184
01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.760
it's your queer Hollywood Video a
re-upload yeah I have a little

1185
01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:53.100
disclaimer thing at the beginning of the
video where it says uh that it is a

1186
01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:56.940
re-upload it's basically taking the five
separate videos and putting them all

1187
01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:00.619
into one so that they're easier to watch

1188
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:17.340
how's your Pokemon gameplay coming along
uh my my I was actually going to do that

1189
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:21.360
tonight I was going to during the stream
I was going to play some of um Soul

1190
01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:25.020
Silver but I can't get the emulator to
work

1191
01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:29.480
it was working fine and now it's just
quit

1192
01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:42.900
but that's that's PC stuff for you
nothing on this computer works

1193
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:48.320
my Mac is over there and that works
great

1194
01:51:48.659 --> 01:51:51.900
the only thing that doesn't work great
on that is OBS and I need that for

1195
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:54.380
streaming

1196
01:52:03.179 --> 01:52:08.820
I love six I I have
that's like my when I'm driving that's

1197
01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:12.860
like my go-to album to put on

1198
01:52:14.699 --> 01:52:18.119
I've been obsessed with people watching
The Color Purple for the first time for

1199
01:52:18.119 --> 01:52:20.420
some reason

1200
01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:41.040
why is my phone exploding

1201
01:52:44.159 --> 01:52:47.780
oh geez thank you hack

1202
01:52:48.179 --> 01:52:53.540
I love that little dancing pair is that
a pear what is that

1203
01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:08.460
I was on a binge of watching people
react to

1204
01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:13.699
um
stray kids music videos for a while

1205
01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:30.600
what time is it e48
okay some good

1206
01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:35.159
till nine o'clock yeah
um

1207
01:53:35.159 --> 01:53:44.239
so I'm Gonna Keep streaming until nine
o'clock it's 8 48 now so in 12 minutes

1208
01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:49.440
are there any gay people in stray kids
uh none that are confirmed though they

1209
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.040
are very cuddly with each other when
some of them are very cuddly with each

1210
01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.739
other when they don't think the cameras
are on

1211
01:53:55.739 --> 01:54:00.900
um
so maybe I'm just kind of there's one in

1212
01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:04.860
particular that I'm really
hoping maybe

1213
01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.699
fingers crossed

1214
01:54:10.139 --> 01:54:14.520
I know that mapa is releasing
bushigiri

1215
01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.739
with the same director who worked on
Banana Fish

1216
01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.320
I thought maybe they were might be
releasing an English dub of banana fish

1217
01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:25.219
and so they're kind of

1218
01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:31.219
building up hype about it but I don't
I don't know

1219
01:54:35.699 --> 01:54:39.780
oh Michael that's not even queer coding
Calamity Jane is

1220
01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:44.600
is like Peak Sapphic filmmaking

1221
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.360
so James are you saying that Tom Holland
is the fourth actor

1222
01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:06.900
no he's not in the the group of actors
that I know of

1223
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.460
um
but you know he is a Dancer so maybe he

1224
01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:16.619
bats for one of our teams
I can hope

1225
01:55:16.619 --> 01:55:19.760
let me have my hope

1226
01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.719
and of curiosity do you have any
favorite trans and or Sapphic focused

1227
01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:27.659
films
um

1228
01:55:27.659 --> 01:55:31.520
well but I love But I'm a Cheerleader

1229
01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.600
um

1230
01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:42.300
there's not a whole lot of like trans
focused movies

1231
01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:45.920
that aren't just depressing

1232
01:55:57.719 --> 01:56:00.300
we actually have
um

1233
01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:04.980
I have a movie
about that I want to make the I have it

1234
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:10.260
planned out it's about a trans singer
um she's like basically a pop Idol she's

1235
01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.980
like Britney Spears level famous
um

1236
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:19.380
and nobody knows that she's trans and
then you know some media finds out and

1237
01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:26.219
she basically her career is
basically officially destroyed like she

1238
01:56:26.219 --> 01:56:30.719
dropped by her label and all that kind
of stuff and she moves home to the town

1239
01:56:30.719 --> 01:56:36.300
she grew up in and then
like plot happens but long story short

1240
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:41.340
she finds out that yeah her label
dropped her but her fans still love her

1241
01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:46.980
and so
she gets to you know still be

1242
01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:53.159
this Idol and now she has even more sort
of cachet because she's

1243
01:56:53.159 --> 01:56:57.480
made it through to the other side and
stuff like that and

1244
01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:03.139
um I really want to do that but when I
write the script I want to kind of have

1245
01:57:03.139 --> 01:57:08.460
a trans Brain Trust read it to make sure
there's nothing in there that

1246
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:13.400
that is you know since the CIS guy is
writing it

1247
01:57:15.119 --> 01:57:18.860
starring Derek Perry no

1248
01:57:35.699 --> 01:57:38.580
I know we usually ask you about queer
stuff but how often do you watch

1249
01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:46.440
non-queer stuff very rarely it's it's
rare that I will put in the the sort of

1250
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:53.699
um emotional effort to
take in straight media

1251
01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.699
um

1252
01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:00.659
especially TV shows like movies sure
like because most movies are straight

1253
01:58:00.659 --> 01:58:03.719
and I would have nothing to watch
movie-wise if I only focused on gay

1254
01:58:03.719 --> 01:58:09.840
stuff uh but like the only Straight TV
show I have watched

1255
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.960
in the last couple of years really has
been succession

1256
01:58:15.179 --> 01:58:19.639
excuse me even succession had a couple
of gay characters

1257
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.540
are there any head
romance novels or movies that you really

1258
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:37.199
enjoyed I'm not a fan of romance novels
in general

1259
01:58:37.199 --> 01:58:43.679
the closest thing to a hetero Romance
movie that I've enjoyed is Pretty Woman

1260
01:58:43.679 --> 01:58:48.599
um but I don't like romance novels in
general like it's rare that I will read

1261
01:58:48.599 --> 01:58:51.900
a romance novel
um

1262
01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:55.400
like red white and royal blue

1263
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:58.980
um
is really the only like romance novel

1264
01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:01.820
that I think I've read

1265
01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:18.540
stand with you nowadays it's like life
is not like that not mine so why bother

1266
01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:21.739
real really though

1267
01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:38.400
I guess I should have confirmed what you
count as queer media what is non-queer

1268
01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:42.540
media with queer characters and what is
fully non-que or anything

1269
01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:48.780
um non-queer anything is like none of
the main characters are queer in any way

1270
01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:52.260
um
sort of include then there's inclusive

1271
01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:57.719
media where there are queer characters
that would be like Shameless

1272
01:59:57.719 --> 01:59:59.840
um

1273
01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:03.659
uh
the Shonda Rhimes stuff I haven't I've

1274
02:00:03.659 --> 02:00:06.599
never watched any of Shonda Rhimes shows
but I know there's there's queer

1275
02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:11.340
characters in there
um and then something that is like queer

1276
02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:15.960
media would be like Queer as Folk uh
glamorous

1277
02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:18.119
um which if you haven't watched
glamorous it's on Netflix it's

1278
02:00:18.119 --> 02:00:23.219
absolutely worth watching it is so good
um

1279
02:00:23.219 --> 02:00:29.239
something like Fire Island would be you
know exclusively queer media

1280
02:00:37.739 --> 02:00:45.080
hero romance books can be not cringe
I don't know if that's possible

1281
02:00:47.699 --> 02:00:51.659
I've tried reading a couple of gay
romance books and I'm just I get like 50

1282
02:00:51.659 --> 02:00:55.199
pages into it and I'm like
this is kind of boring I know exactly

1283
02:00:55.199 --> 02:00:57.920
how this ends

1284
02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:03.320
oh thank you Sarah I hope you're having
a good evening too

1285
02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:11.760
critics I feel like here's
I have noticed a pattern

1286
02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.639
when it comes especially with TV if
there is a queer show that is just that

1287
02:01:17.639 --> 02:01:22.080
doesn't deal with queer trauma
or gay bashing

1288
02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.960
or
um

1289
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.139
some kind of assault
or anything like that or discrimination

1290
02:01:31.139 --> 02:01:36.300
but it's queer critics don't like it
they it seems like they like it seems

1291
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:40.099
like
queer people need to be

1292
02:01:40.099 --> 02:01:45.659
experiencing trauma or have experienced
trauma or are currently suffering in

1293
02:01:45.659 --> 02:01:50.159
order for most critics to like something
um

1294
02:01:50.159 --> 02:01:57.179
glamorous is fun frivolous
um

1295
02:01:57.179 --> 02:02:04.580
and you can watch it and never once
watching it will you feel pangs of of

1296
02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:11.940
anxiety or hurt or anything like that
and so critics are like oh this that

1297
02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:15.500
must mean that it's not good

1298
02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:23.639
I think it was Jason I think Q force was
kind of treated the same way like in my

1299
02:02:23.639 --> 02:02:27.000
I know there's lots of queer people who
didn't like you force

1300
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.719
um most of the most of the ones that
I've talked to didn't like it because

1301
02:02:30.719 --> 02:02:35.400
they felt the characters were
stereotypes and the way I look at it as

1302
02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.239
someone who has gotten to know a lot of
different queer people is that their

1303
02:02:39.239 --> 02:02:43.920
stereotypes for a reason those people
exist you may not like that they exist

1304
02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.719
you may prefer they don't exist you may
prefer that

1305
02:02:48.719 --> 02:02:53.760
every lesbian is a lipstick lesbian and
every gay dude is Pete bootage and every

1306
02:02:53.760 --> 02:03:00.619
trans person is is Laverne Cox but
that's not how the world works

1307
02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:12.840
straight critics have very low
receptiveness to gay media exactly

1308
02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.080
I think the characters were also based
on the actors who played them to some

1309
02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:22.280
extent I could see that
maybe not the one that Sean Hayes played

1310
02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:31.020
speaking of queer trauma have you seen a
set of BBC documentaries called AIDS the

1311
02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:35.280
unheard tapes I highly recommend you
have a look if you can find them where

1312
02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.860
you are
it's uh I haven't heard of them no

1313
02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:46.739
um but I've even avoided um it's a sin
because I'm like I have watched so many

1314
02:03:46.739 --> 02:03:54.199
depressing AIDS things
I've had enough

1315
02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:02.840
yeah the Wanda Sykes character maybe
yeah maybe

1316
02:04:09.659 --> 02:04:14.760
queer critics are torn on how queer
media should betray sex some snub any

1317
02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:19.320
show where the characters aren't on
Grindr others clutch their pearls if the

1318
02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:22.920
characters mention sex once I've noticed
that it's really irritating that's one

1319
02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:27.840
of the things I liked about glamorous is
that the characters have sex but it's

1320
02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:33.540
not like the most important Forefront
thing on them like there are jokes about

1321
02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:40.080
Grindr but Grinder is not like
pivotal to the plot of the show and

1322
02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:45.360
stuff and I don't know I just critics
were horrible to glamorous but it's

1323
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.139
doing relatively well on Netflix it
didn't cost very much to make I hope

1324
02:04:49.139 --> 02:04:53.280
there's a second season because there's
there's some uh developments at the end

1325
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:58.880
of the season that I would really like
to see play out in a second season

1326
02:05:08.099 --> 02:05:12.060
stories from the people who were there
in their own words and voices and it's

1327
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:14.360
beautiful

1328
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.320
that might be something I chat there's
an AIDS video

1329
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.520
um that I'll be doing in the fall it's
actually a part of the Hollywood history

1330
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:27.900
um
sort of uh

1331
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:32.520
Hollywood the history series uh so I may
actually check that out

1332
02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:35.060
for that

1333
02:05:51.239 --> 02:05:55.500
if they were happy untraumatized queer
characters in like a fantasy thing I

1334
02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:01.080
don't think I'd blink but I would be
confused to see a show set present past

1335
02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:05.040
president passed with queer is not
constantly Under Siege

1336
02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.659
see I
I prefer not having

1337
02:06:09.659 --> 02:06:13.619
queers Under Siege because we need an
escape

1338
02:06:13.619 --> 02:06:17.880
we need an escape
and

1339
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.199
that's like that's what I loved about
Yuri on ice for instance is that there

1340
02:06:22.199 --> 02:06:25.739
were queer characters and nobody made a
big deal out of it

1341
02:06:25.739 --> 02:06:30.119
and that's what I loved about glamorous
nobody made a big deal at queer

1342
02:06:30.119 --> 02:06:34.560
characters being queer and I just I
really I appreciate that because there

1343
02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:38.460
are there is a place for dramatic queer
storytelling that does deal with stuff

1344
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:44.400
like bashing and Trauma and stuff like
that but then if that's all that we

1345
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.500
cover it's it it it it it it it wears
down people and there's a reason that

1346
02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:53.940
like queer media that's just constantly
talking about how much it sucks to be

1347
02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:58.800
queer is like you know it doesn't do
well it's because yeah why should why am

1348
02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:04.099
I gonna go pay to see a movie about
being depressing

1349
02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:16.619
uh Paul I think they're probably going
to deal with

1350
02:07:16.619 --> 02:07:19.260
um
with

1351
02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:24.239
um that stuff in season three or they'll
like hint at it in season two but I

1352
02:07:24.239 --> 02:07:30.560
don't think they're gonna jump into it
like tweet first in season two

1353
02:07:48.599 --> 02:07:57.119
it is nine o'clock uh I'm gonna take off
and get something to eat because I keep

1354
02:07:57.119 --> 02:08:02.820
forgetting to do that all day and I'm
not losing any weight it's like

1355
02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:07.380
what's wrong with you buddy
um

1356
02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:12.239
but yeah uh I might stream again
tomorrow maybe I can even get the

02:08:12.239 --> 02:08:16.860
