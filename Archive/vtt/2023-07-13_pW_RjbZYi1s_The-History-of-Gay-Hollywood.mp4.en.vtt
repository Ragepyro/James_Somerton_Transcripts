over the last several years there have
been demands for more lgbtq

5
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
representation in Hollywood movies but
something that many people don't know is

6
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.120
that the first movie to ever win best
picture at the Academy Awards was also

7
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.379
the first major Hollywood film to show a
gay kiss William a Wellman's film Wings

8
00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.460
released in
1927. in Wings two World War One

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.719
with their growing feelings for one
another despite being labeled a

11
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.019
friendship for the duration of the film
perhaps to circumvent censorship

12
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
requirements it is evident that these
two men are developing romantic feelings

13
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.020
for one another made clear by the
climactic dramatic kiss Wellman's silent

14
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
film captures one of the earliest
examples of lgbtq cinema by carefully

15
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
Towing the censorship line the film
examines the expressed passions of two

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.880
men entangled in the conflict of World
War One and the emotional torment of the

17
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
Forbidden connection wing went on to be
a box office Smash and even at a time

18
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
when the film industry was quickly
transitioning to sound became the only

19
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.119
truly silent film to win best picture
but Wings is actually not where our

Story begins the history of Hollywood
has always had an asterisk beside it

21
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.479

the love that dared not speak its name
in America was surprisingly fluent when

32
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.860
speaking German throughout the silent
era of film while America was using its

new toy to glorify the old west
recreating The Fading dreams of its own

34
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.099
mythology European Cinema was shaping a
more realistic look at the diversity of

35
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.420
sex and gender in much of Europe at the
time homosexuality was often just

another aspect of the Panorama of Human
Relationships The Institute for sexual

became Ground Zero in the fight against

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.060
Germany's anti-gay paragraph 175 which
criminalized homosexual actions between

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.659
men during the era of the sexual
Enlightenment that occurred in pre-war

tolerance for what is termed the third

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.360
even read false beliefs and unjustified
prejudices concerning a sector of male

45
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.500
and female sexual behavior known as
homosexuality or love of the same sex

46
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.060
have been predominant up to the present
and still influence a large part of our

47
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.780
population these homosexual men and
women who are attracted to persons of

48
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.220
their own sex are often regarded as
wicked criminals and Libertines but

49
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.600
scientific research has determined that
homosexuality is an inborn tendency for

50
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.440
which the individual cannot be held
responsible there are homosexuals in

51
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.880
every class among the educated and among
the uneducated and in the highest and

52
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.139
lowest sectors of the population in the
great cities and the small towns among

53
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.580
the strict moralists and among the most
easy-going that love for one's own sex

54
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.960
can be just as pure and Noble as love
for the opposite sex

55
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.479
the only difference being the object of
Desire not the nature of one's love the

56
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.720
film along with other films from the
same era that dealt with topics such as

57
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.060
abortion incest sex education and
venereal disease was propagandistic in

58
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.380
its approach in the early 1930s Nazis
were responsible for the destruction of

59
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.040
most prints of the film Christopher
isherwood recalls at the time that Nazis

60
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.880
frequently disrupted screenings of the
film in Vienna one of them discharged a

61
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.600
handgun into the crowd injuring multiple
people in his book Christopher and His

62
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.220
Kind isherwood provides a first-person
description of the movie three scenes

63
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.720
remain in my memory
one is that a ball at which the dancers

64
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.000
all male are standing fully clothed in
what seems about to become a daisy chain

65
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.139
it is here that the character played by
Conrad veit meets The blackmailer Who

66
00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.699
seduces him and then ruins him
the next scene is a vision in which Vite

67
00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.080
has a long procession of Kings poets
scientists philosophers and other famous

68
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.720
victims of homophobia moving slowly and
sadly with hands bowed Dr hirschfeld

69
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.800
himself appears
I think the corpse of Conrad veit who

70
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.699
has committed suicide at this point is
laying in the background

71
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.560
hirschfeld delivers a speech that is to
say a series of titles pleading

72
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.360
tolerance for the third sex and so it
was that the very first gay man to ever

73
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.400
be portrayed on film met his tragic End
by taking his own life this would

74
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.380
determine the future of LGBT characters
on film and television for many years to

75
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.639
come the suicide of Vite and the idea of
blackmail predicted the fates of

76
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.479
American Screen characters who would
suffer for their sexuality in like

77
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.220
manner when American Cinema reached a
similar point of inclusion

78
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.560
about 50 years later it would appear
that the recognition of the third sex in

79
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.940
Europe was not associated with a
particular concept of masculinity as was

80
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.560
the case in the United States the focus
of the drama and Intrigue was not on the

81
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.660
sexual aspects of the passions that were
awakened in human relationships rather

82
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.280
the emotional qualities of the passions
that were aroused in human relationships

83
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.380
in Mikhail produced in 1924 we see a gay
love story in which a famous artist

84
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.259
falls in love with his young male model
the model however is an opportunist who

85
00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.060
saps his benefactor's artistic Spirit
eventually spurning his affections for

86
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.680
the more promising charms of a wealthy
young princess in the end the artist

87
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.960
leaves all of his possessions to the
youth and on his deathbed declares

88
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.460
I can die in peace
I have known a great love

89
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.020
the film which was adapted from the book
of the same name was released in America

90
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.259
for a limited time in 1926 under murky
circumstances what would come to be

91
00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:48.599
titled chained the story of the third
sex ran for a short time at New York's

92
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.680
Fifth Avenue Playhouse American sensors
objected to its first issued English

93
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.639
title the inverts the modifications to
the titles provide an excellent

94
00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:00.180
illustration of the American thinking
about homosexuality during that time

95
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.680
period the subtitle the story of the
third sex suggests that any narrative

96
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.940
that deals with gay love regardless of
how seriously it does so is considered

97
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.919
to be a story about homosexuality while
stories that deal with heterosexual love

98
00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:19.259
are simply seen as stories this appears
to be just as much of an issue for

99
00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:23.940
American filmmakers and producers today
as they appear to be unable to conceive

100
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.099
of the existence of queer characters in
a movie unless the subject matter of the

101
00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:34.320
movie is itself being Queer as
understood and depicted by

102
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.339
mostly straight people this discussion
of gay men shouldn't suggest that

103
00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:42.959
lesbians didn't also get attention in
the film Pandora's Box which was

104
00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:48.180
originally shown in Germany in 1929
there is a figure who is most likely the

105
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.480
first lesbian on screen to be portrayed
overtly

106
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.500
the film presented the story of the
great unrequited love and passion

107
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.540
between two women the Countess keshvitz
and the lady she is enamored with Lulu

108
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.800
although the love that geschvitz feels
for Lulu is referred to as sterile

109
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.839
within the context of the movie it is a
driving force in the action and it makes

110
00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:14.640
the introduction of a Sapphic passion on
screen an exciting and historical

111
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.779
cinematic event an event American
audiences likely would never know of

112
00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:23.339
British sensors deleted the character of
Countess geschwitz from the film before

113
00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:27.779
Prince were sent off to America though
original German Prince did eventually

114
00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:32.580
make it across the pond in the 1960s
when it comes to American-made gay

115
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.459
characters one of the earliest direct
references to homosexuality was a parody

116
00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:43.380
which is predictable I suppose the one
real comedy short the soilers starring

117
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.420
Stan Laurel was a parody of the
successful Western the spoilers

118
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.160
a drawn out battle sequence between the
film's lead Laurel and a corrupt Sheriff

119
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.360
takes up the majority of the running
time but another very gay cowboy

120
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.200
suddenly appears on the screen in the
middle of the brawl as the two men

121
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.459
continue to quarrel he makes a show of
batting his eyes at both of them and

122
00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:08.279
primping a little bit before sashaying
out of the room

123
00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:13.260
Laurel wins the fight against the
sheriff but no one appears to care

124
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.880
as a result he is left sitting outside
the tavern looking disheartened the gay

125
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.600
cowboy pokes his head out of a second
floor window and lavishly blows Laurel a

126
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.519
kiss while mouthing the words my hero
when Laurel rejects him

127
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:31.140
he drops a flower pot on his head
this is one of the first examples of the

128
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.519
use of the harmless image to
present homosexuality in film but in the

129
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.540
context of rough and tough men in the
soon-to-be industry-dominant Western

130
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:45.000
genre we were laying the foundations of
the Trope from the word go there is a

131
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.779
very overt connection between the
effeminate and apparent homosexual in

132
00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:52.980
this film even though the cowboy was not
supposed to be impersonating a woman the

133
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.399
primping and fussing characteristics
that he displayed were unmistakably

134
00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:01.140
those of a woman at least as men at the
time expected women to act the comedy

135
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.860
here was highlighting how out of place
this boy was in the Rough and

136
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.480
Tumble world of the men who won the West
the irony of course is that there is

137
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.920
significant historical evidence to
suggest that the West Was in fact Rife

138
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.200
with gay men many from Europe and was
largely settled by women in sex work

139
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.399
however even though the soilers is a
mockery of queerness among other things

140
00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:27.720
the use of satire indicates that
homosexuality especially in the context

141
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.459
of it existing in traditionally
masculine spaces was on the mind of the

142
00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:36.720
public at large satire can't function
well if it's not deriving context from

143
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.519
popular ideas even as the Cowboy
isn't flattering though he is slaying

144
00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.140
his inclusion indicates that the public
was perhaps at the time willing to

145
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.880
accept us as harmless
though strange and out of place however

146
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.880
this was precisely the kind of event
that the sensors were keeping an eye out

147
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.260
for public ordinances already enabled
censoring organizations around the

148
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.160
country to look at pictures in advance
of public showings although all of those

149
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.600
such entities had little actual
Authority the rules for Morality In the

150
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.560
movies clearly mentioned sex perversion
as a key don't

151
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.000
even if queerness was the subject of
ridicule

152
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.160
the United States Supreme Court ruled in
1915 the exhibition of Motion Pictures

153
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.839
is a business pure and simple and is
conducted for profit like other

154
00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:28.560
spectacles not to be regarded or
intended to be regarded as a part of the

155
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.779
presence of the nation or the organs of
public opinion this decision meant that

156
00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:38.100
movies were not protected by the First
Amendment guarantee of free speech due

157
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.940
to this ruling harsh censorship
legislation was eventually enacted in

158
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.839
the states of New York Florida
Massachusetts Maryland and Virginia

159
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:50.220
within just a few years following the
Judgment the gold standard in the United

160
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.360
States was in the New York statute
passed in 1921

161
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.399
it stated that a film should be licensed
by the state unless such a film or part

162
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:04.079
thereof is of such character that its
exhibition would tend to corrupt morals

163
00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:10.560
or incite crime the indecency immorality
and obscenity were nowhere described or

164
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.480
defined in the statute and thus there
was considerable latitude for

165
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.680
interpretation essentially giving free
reign to wealthy white right-wing

166
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.540
Christian men to dictate what could and
could not be in any given film released

167
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.620
in these states one of the first
instances of lesbians kissing on screen

168
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.120
was in a brief orgy scene in Cecil B
demille's manslaughter in 1922 the

169
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.560
vision of two passionate women locked in
a forbidden Embrace was used by demil to

170
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.420
condemn the excesses of sex that he was
portraying so graphically and

171
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.060
excessively in return for his judgment
on the crime he was consistently allowed

172
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.560
to paint a more explicit picture of evil
especially sexual sins than was

173
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.480
ordinarily permitted by Hollywood sense
users showing things like sex

174
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.500
homosexuality interracial relationships
and other such things was fine as long

175
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.459
as the participants were punished this
was particularly true when the

176
00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:09.240
retribution transpired in a Biblical
City quoting scripture on their title

177
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.100
cards DeMille films became moral lessons
rather than exploitation or so was said

178
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.959
they also became box office
extravaganzas which leads me to wonder

179
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:24.300
just how far back the connection between
these distinctly American sets of Pop

180
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:30.899
Christianity neopuritanical values and
American entertainment really goes by

181
00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:35.880
1922 there were censorship bills before
the legislature of 32 states and

182
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.019
throughout the nation the distinct rank
of moral indignation was wafting its way

183
00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:45.120
toward an industry that at times seemed
to embody Wicked behavior of all kinds

184
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:51.959
the sensors were horrified by Salome a
1923 film with a reportedly all Queer

185
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:56.519
cast made in tribute to Oscar Wilde
forcing several sequences to be cut

186
00:14:56.519 --> 00:15:00.959
altogether including one showing the gay
relationship between two Syrian Soldiers

187
00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:05.699
the handwritten report of the exam
limiting sensor in New York concluded

188
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:10.740
this picture is in no way religious in
theme or interpretation in my judgment

189
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.019
it is a story of depravity in immorality
made worse because of its biblical

190
00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:20.639
background
absolutely sacrilegious American sensors

191
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:24.779
became even more potent in the late
1920s and early 30s the inclusion of

192
00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:29.399
audio into what were briefly dubbed as
talkies brought a new element of realism

193
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:33.720
to the screen and public morality
Watchdogs began to Bear Down on the

194
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.000
industry but while censorship laws were
becoming more specific their outlook on

195
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.980
gay representation was kept vaguely
broad you didn't need two men or women

196
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.839
kissing to get banned cross-dressing
weakness or softness in male characters

197
00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:53.279
and even overly intellectual male
characters were enough to draw the ire

198
00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:56.940
of sensors will Hayes was appointed
president of the motion picture

199
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:03.420
producers and Distributors of America or
mppda in the late 1920s Hayes served as

200
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.720
both an elder and the Presbyterian
church and as a former Postmaster

201
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.860
General of the United States that was
the extent of his qualifications the

202
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.100
organization was established primarily
with the goals of fostering positive

203
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.399
public relations for the studios and
shielding the business from the

204
00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:21.600
potential of more restrictions from the
outside world which they mostly achieved

205
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.560
in 1930 when the motion picture
production code which served as the

206
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.639
basis for the industry's self-regulation
and censorship was actually written when

207
00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:33.660
the code was strengthened in 1934 under
intense pressure from the Catholic

208
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.759
Church even gently eluded gay characters
began to disappear the image of the film

209
00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:43.139
business as being harsh and manly with
no tolerance for foolishness was in

210
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:47.399
continual conflict with the industry's
reputation for being effeminate the

211
00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:51.600
sensors used the archetype to
Target on-screen characters using it as

212
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.259
a thinly veiled scapegoat to put
pressure on a relatively Progressive

213
00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:59.940
media industry which had been a safe
haven for queer creators of all types up

214
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.220
to that but filmmakers knew how to skirt
the sensors in many cases the fact that

215
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.079
most early movies sissies were only gay
if one chose to see them as being gay

216
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.819
was simply a reflection of the fact that
the existence of queer people in society

217
00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:20.760
was acknowledged only when and Society
chose to do so instead of being overtly

218
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.620
queer characters like say the Femme
Cowboy from the soilers were viewed as

219
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:31.440
symbols for failed masculinity rather
than actual homosexuals and so they were

220
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.679
allowed to stick around most sissies
during the reign of the code were not

221
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:39.240
necessarily demeaned nor were they used
in Cruel or offensive ways it was not

222
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.160
the but what he stood for that was
offensive some actors created memorable

223
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.539
galleries of gossipy snoops and snippy
shopkeepers who were often a little bit

224
00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:53.220
on the innocent side
but not always gays were also associated

225
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:58.140
with dangerous revolutionaries hiding
beneath the surface of normal society

226
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.460
the ghetto was one other world in which
gay characters might frequently be seen

227
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.600
on screen before and after the reign of
the motion picture code this represented

228
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.799
the reality of the majority of gay
experiences at the time which had been

229
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:15.120
restricted to manifestations and slums
of one kind or another the underground

230
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.160
Life as a shelter for gays is a common
theme in many instances the gay ghetto

231
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.880
has been linked to the criminal
underground this is due to the fact that

232
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.020
whenever there is an increase in illegal
activity of any kind even homosexuality

233
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.080
organized crime moves in to take control
of the situation and make a profit

234
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.140
though it should be noted that organized
crime functions vary differently than

235
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.880
Hollywood often depicts and in some
cases especially from the 1940s onward

236
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.380
can be beneficial to a growing community
in preventing gentrification and

237
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.820
climbing rental rates though as far as
Hollywood played into misconception of

238
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.720
criminal Behavior homosexuals were
widely considered to be a criminal Group

239
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.460
which differentiated them from other
types of minority groups crime rates

240
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.660
might be high in some majority non-white
areas but just being a person of color

241
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.220
was not itself technically illegal
though representatives of law

242
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.960
enforcement may act otherwise the film
blood Money released in 1933 showed a

243
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.340
great deal of ambiguous sexual tension
in The Wider underworld in the movie the

244
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.299
existence of homosexuality is openly
acknowledged in the subculture that is a

245
00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:25.799
shelter on the fringes of acceptable
Society in the film Sandra Shaw is

246
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:29.640
featured in several sequences as a
fun-loving blonde who likes men's

247
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.760
clothes
at one point in the film her boyfriend

248
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.780
is preparing for a date along with his
sister a nightclub owner who warns him

249
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.240
about the kind of women he's running
with

250
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.340
oh this one is nothing but Claire
where's the miracle and a man of tuxedo

251
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.480
though he gets what she means and
protests later in the film Shaw turns up

252
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.340
again in a tweed jacket this time with
another woman in tow movies like this

253
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.960
were what led to further intensification
of censorship in the mid-1930s in

254
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.919
addition to strengthening the code will
Hayes reacted to criticism by inserting

255
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:07.740
morality Clauses into the contracts of
actors and compiled a doom book of 117

256
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.660
names of those deemed unsafe because of
their personal lives homosexuality was

257
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.440
denied as fervently off-screen as it was
on

258
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.299
a literally unspeakable part of the
culture Hollywood has always been more

259
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:25.620
restrained on screen than in real life
in Blood Money homosexuality is just

260
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.220
another pocket of an underworld that
exists outside the law sexual

261
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.419
connotations often surrounded the
attitudes of powerful men toward hired

262
00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:37.500
boys or servile companions
although the villainous character of

263
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.820
Joel Cairo in the Maltese Falcon is
identified by Sam Spade secretary in the

264
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.160
novel as homosexual the film version
instead just turns him into a perfume

265
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.720
wearing Kane kissing with lace
handkerchiefs Elijah cook Jr as Sydney

266
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.299
Green Street's bodyguard Wilmer however
is implicitly homosexual he is referred

267
00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:02.520
to as sunny boy and kid and Bogart
derisively calls him a gunzel since

268
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.140
about 1915 prisoners had used the German
word gonzal to mean a bottom especially

269
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.280
young inexperienced criminal bottoms all
of this was meant to connect the queer

270
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.780
underworld with the underworld run
mostly by the Sicilian Mafia who due to

271
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.020
movies like Scarface and Public Enemy
were roundly feared across the country

272
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.340
this fear the queer mindset was brought
to its logical conclusion in the horror

273
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.080
films of the 1930s where gays appeared
as predatory Twilight creatures with a

274
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.820
sense of style the equation of horror
with the sins of the flesh is easily

275
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.720
scene in Monster movies of the period
creatures like Frankenstein's monster

276
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.000
and Count Dracula were almost always
linked with the baser instincts of human

277
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.740
beings the essence of homosexuality as a
predatory weakness permeates the

278
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.580
depiction of gay characters in horror
films in Dracula's daughter countress

279
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.740
Maria zaleska has a special attraction
to women a preference that was even

280
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.539
highlighted in some of the original ads
for the film queer parallels in 1931's

281
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:07.740
Frankenstein and its 1935 sequel the
Bride of Frankenstein arose from a

282
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.400
vision that both films had of the
monster as an impossible anti-social

283
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.000
figure in the same way that gay people
were things that should not have

284
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.679
happened in both films the homosexuality
of director James whale may have been

285
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:23.580
the spark of the vision Robert Aldrich
director of the camp progenitor whatever

286
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.200
happened to Baby Jane recalls that Jimmy
whale was the first guy who was

287
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.159
blackballed because he refused to stay
in the closet Mitchell lisin and all

288
00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:36.480
those other guys played it straight and
they were on board but whale said okay

289
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.140
I'm a great director and I don't have to
put up with this and he was a

290
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.559
great director not just a company
director and he was just unemployed

291
00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:48.659
after that never worked again it should
be noted that many articles on James

292
00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:54.000
whale do not reference his refusal to be
closeted nor the haze code in general as

293
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.100
a reason for the decline of his career
in spite of available first-hand

294
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.780
testimonials demonstrating that it
wasn't just a contributing factor that

295
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.400
it was the main reason and Aldrich who
was a company director if not an

296
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.780
incredibly good one would have been in
the know about what producers and Studio

297
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.740
heads were saying behind the scenes
according to Aldrich an obviously

298
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.059
lesbian director like Dorothy arsener
got away with her lifestyle because she

299
00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:24.960
was officially closeted
a gay woman keeping her lifestyle on the

300
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.059
sly was fine because it made her one of
the boys but a man who like whale openly

301
00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:33.900
admitted to his loving relationship with
another man in this case producer David

302
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.640
Lewis did not stand a chance although
James whale did work again briefly in

303
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.960
1943
he fell Into Obscurity soon after in

304
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.059
1957 he was found dead at the bottom of
his swimming pool Frankenstein's monster

305
00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:53.400
was the creation that would eventually
destroy its creator just as whale's own

306
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.260
aberration would eventually destroy his
career the monster in Frankenstein Bears

307
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.520
the brunt of society's reaction to his
existence and in the sequel the Bride of

308
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.400
Frankenstein the monster himself is
painfully aware of his own

309
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.720
unnaturalness in Frankenstein it is the
monster who limits Henry Frankenstein's

310
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.340
contact with the normal World The Old
Baron Frankenstein's father continually

311
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.919
begs his son to leave the madness to
come home and marry the young Elizabeth

best friend go to the lab to force him

queerness of the Frankenstein story
would reach its logical Camp conclusion

with The Rocky Horror Picture Show a
cult classic rock musical the 20th

330
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.039
Century Fox never gave a proper wide
release in the United States and it's

331
00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:48.600
unlikely that now that they own It
Disney will either since 1976 the film

has been playing Midnight shows in
cities throughout the country a truly

333
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.419
subversive film on the subjects of
sexuality movies sex roles and the Queer

334
00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:01.919
as Monster Rocky Horror features two
innocent presumed straight protagonists

335
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:06.480
Brad and Janet who have car troubles not
far from a dubious manner this

deviant sexuality who introduces himself
as a Sweet Transvestite from transsexual

well his penis possible penis we can't
know for certain he is an alien after

344
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.340
all as both a catalog and a spoof of old
monster movies and science fiction films

345
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.659
The Rocky Horror Picture Show becomes
almost dizzying in its references but

346
00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:56.039
its most expert satire is of the age-old
fear with which mainstream Society

347
00:26:56.039 --> 00:27:00.539
encounters deviant sexuality and is Then
followed through to the very end when

348
00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:04.919
frankenfurter is destroyed for the good
of society nevertheless he has one last

349
00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:09.480
chance in life to perform with the
entire cast an underwater ballet version

350
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.220
of the film's main message don't dream
it be it

351
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.720
a song that becomes a message of Hope
for everyone who feels like they're not

352
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.500
quite who they're supposed to be just
yet Tim Curry's performance especially

353
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.480
in his rendition of Sweet Transvestite
is the essence of what every parent in

354
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.880
America feared would happen if our
sexual standards were relaxed it becomes

355
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.679
the living horror of making deviant
sexuality visible and tangible in the

356
00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:41.720
only kind of setting in which it could
possibly work an old dark house

357
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:47.400
populated by every letter of the lgbtq
alphabet soup as they sing rock and roll

358
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.080
to seduce the innocent youth of America
Hollywood didn't know what to do with

359
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.919
The Rocky Horror Picture Show then and
probably wouldn't know what to do with

360
00:27:55.919 --> 00:28:00.659
it now but despite its shabby treatment
it has grossed hundreds of millions of

361
00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:04.679
dollars over the years and continues to
play throughout the world audiences made

362
00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:09.659
up of largely young people who attend
screenings with bags of rice stale toast

363
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:15.120
corsets boas and fishnets Rocky Horror
was shining a spotlight on the dimly lit

364
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.260
representation of queer monsters in the
1930s Golden Era of Hollywood giving

365
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.059
them one last hurray as a posthumous
Victory against the haze code which

366
00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:29.720
collapsed entirely just a few years
before its release but back in the 1930s

367
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.740
filmmakers still had to be clever about
coding the characters specifically to

368
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.940
make it past the sensors
General American audiences though could

369
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.320
easily see through the coding
however

370
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.039
it wasn't long before the easily red
coating

371
00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:51.960
was forced to become almost if not
completely

372
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.620
illegible

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.209
[Music]

374
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.799
in Hollywood's early years homosexuality
found its way on screen in ways both

375
00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:09.539
secret and obvious to the filmmakers
behind the camera audiences rarely

376
00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:15.299
pushed back against these depictions but
those who did were loud if not Legion

377
00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:19.140
women's suffrage groups and the Catholic
Church were the most dedicated to

378
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.440
removing gay and lesbian content from
Hollywood movies and with the

379
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.220
institution of the motion picture
production code they more or less

380
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.360
succeeded filmmakers could now be fined
or blacklisted for including gay and

381
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.140
lesbian characters in their movies and
some films such as Dracula's daughter

382
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:39.960
were heavily edited to remove any overt
lesbian content but go figure a bunch of

383
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.200
people who came up in the industry
through artistic Roots knew how to

384
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.760
manipulate literary devices in visual
language to still include gay themes and

385
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.840
characters in their movies
though in much less obvious ways along

386
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.380
with World War II and a coming end to
what was referred to as the Golden Age

387
00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.120
of Hollywood a time of gay invisibility
had swept over the industry but it was

388
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.260
an invisibility that you could see
through if you knew how to look even

389
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:09.120
though Hollywood didn't always tell the
truth this kept a lot of unwelcome facts

390
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.679
and small problems from getting in the
way of the American dream even though

391
00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:18.000
gay and lesbian people were often the
ones who made these dreams come true

392
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.440
they were never a part of it it is said
that Sam Goldwin founder of Goldwyn

393
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.240
pictures which was one of the three
Studios that merged to create MGM once

394
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.620
wanted to film The Well of Loneliness by
Radcliffe Hall but when a producer told

395
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.279
him they couldn't because the main
character was a lesbian Goldwin simply

396
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:40.620
responded by saying so what we'll make
her American despite goldwyn's confusing

397
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:47.340
lesbian for Lebanese the Americanization
of lesbianism did happen and meant

398
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.539
nothing more than the simple refusal to
deal with it honestly it was an

399
00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:55.380
imitation of the American fear of
sexuality in general and the American

400
00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.179
duplicity regarding sexual deviance in
particular in all actuality it was the

401
00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:04.500
same invisibility that gays experienced
in real life only replicated in the

402
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.539
movies despite this gays continued to
make an appearance as subtextual

403
00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:14.340
Phantoms that represented the fear of
homosexuality itself they served as his

404
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.899
alien life forms that were yet firmly
established as per part of the culture

405
00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:23.460
in every Walk of Life and they formed
the shadowy counterpart to the concept

406
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.200
of the American dream sissies and
tomboys were used as yardsticks for what

407
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.460
was deemed acceptable behavior in a
culture that was so preoccupied with the

408
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.200
upkeep of sex norms and the celebration
of everything masculine one performer

409
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.460
who happily ignored these sex Norms was
Greta Garbo whose performance as Queen

410
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.200
Christina in the film of the same name
released in 1934 was a challenge to the

411
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.640
standards of sexual and gender behavior
that were considered acceptable at the

412
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.200
time it was the Collision on screen of
her own androgynous aesthetic with the

413
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.980
reality of Christina's affinity for
masculine clothes and activities that

414
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.760
gave the picture a realism that was
uniquely its own Garbo who would Express

415
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.600
her desire to be in a film version of
Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray

416
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.679
with herself in the title role and
Marilyn Monroe as a young girl ruined by

417
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:16.020
Dorian created a particular dynamic in
Queen Christina one that penetrated the

queer Erasure of the script her for
Lauren longings to escape her gloomy

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.720
Destiny of marriage and her skillful
rejection of a series of male suitors

420
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.100
are broken in the first part of the film
by her encounter with the Countess ebba

421
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.779
Spar played by Elizabeth young their
brief scene together is charged with

422
00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:38.220
sexuality and real affection in that
scene Garbo lifts the emotional barriers

423
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.419
to characterize her encounters with mail
suitors Abba suggests brightly that they

424
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:48.559
go for a sleigh ride but Christina tells
her sadly I can't know oh why not

I have no intention to Chancellor I

429
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.880
her need to escape the role assigned her
by life was Christina's true driving

430
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.600
passion
Queen Christina makes this abundantly

431
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.679
clear she flees into the snow later in
the film when she discovers that

432
00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:29.159
ebbespauer has betrayed her love that is
when she meets Antonio the one man who

433
00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:34.559
seems to accept her and love her for all
the things that so horrify her court but

434
00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:38.399
he falls in love with her thinking at
first that she's a man

435
00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:42.059
and he seems quite willing to explore
whatever this strange situation may

436
00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:46.260
bring in the early days of Hollywood
queen Christina stood out due to the

437
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.519
fact that it included a character that
was unmistakably bisexual as well as

438
00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:54.840
many instances of bisexuality in The
Narrative of the film itself at the time

439
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.260
the lives of notable gay men and
lesbians were either portrayed in a

440
00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.220
manner that was drastically different
from their actual experiences or were

441
00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.059
not addressed at all in biographical
films this straight watching of History

442
00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:11.099
has only marginally changed in modern
Cinema as seen by the fact that films

443
00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:15.540
such as Troy A Beautiful Mind and the
imitation game more or less ignore or

444
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.960
completely erase the fact that its
primary characters are gay or bisexual

445
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.379
it's one of the reasons why audience
members were taken aback by the lesbian

446
00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:26.339
relationships that were depicted in the
favorite even in the late 2010s

447
00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:30.300
audiences of historical biopics
anticipated that queerness would be

448
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.780
erased from historical Recreations the
Betrayal of noted persons as

449
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.800
heterosexual without regard for their
true to life sexuality has never been

450
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.119
seen as a serious offense against a
person's identity until recently not

451
00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:45.540
even by the person whose life is
falsified no it was better to be

452
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.560
straight even queer audiences themselves
believe that especially in Hollywood's

453
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.119
golden age when it was a dirty secret
most people yearned to be rid of but

454
00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:57.119
there was an odd dichotomy developing in
Hollywood

455
00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:01.020
whereas lesbian or bisexual female
characters could be redeemed in a film

456
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.619
by being paired off with the right man
in the end bisexual or gay male

457
00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:08.640
characters had no such luxury in the
film Adam's Rib which was released in

458
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.520
1949 David Wayne plays the role of Kip
who is a yardstick par Excellence

459
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.680
Kip serves as Catherine Hepburn's
girlfriend acting as a high-class Ethel

460
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.000
Mertz to her feminist Lucy Ricardo
despite Catherine Hepburn's defense

461
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.619
Spencer Tracy's apparent unease around
him cannot be denied as they were

462
00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:31.859
leaving the room following a heated
discussion over feminism Wayne said to

463
00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:36.000
Hepburn you've got me so convinced I may
even go out and become a woman when

464
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.160
Wayne has gone Spencer Tracy mutters and
he wouldn't have far to go either

465
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.079
Hepburn's Amanda can only shush him an
indication that her feminism like that

466
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:50.640
of contemporary feminists who wanted
their sons to grow up to be real men

467
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.440
goes only so far and breaks down at the
thought of actually obscuring sex and

468
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.579
gender roles altogether yet the
unyielding conviction in the masculine

469
00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:03.240
role along with the hatred that this
ideology bred

470
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.500
was about to be shaken to its very
Foundation the buddy system that had

471
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.339
been used during the second world war
had brought troops closer together than

472
00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:15.839
they had ever been before men who loved
each other's company but always selected

473
00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:19.500
women to display their manhood were
forced to confront their innate

474
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.119
sexuality in the all-male atmosphere of
military forces this brought to the

475
00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:27.780
surface a misunderstanding regarding
men's fundamental sexuality

476
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.000
the worry that these heterosexual
relationships between men may in any way

477
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.920
be interpreted as being gay was a very
genuine one and the movies made sure

478
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.280
that there was no indication of
homosexuality involved in depictions of

479
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.839
such Partnerships there might have been
less suspicion of homosexuality had the

480
00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:49.859
level of paranoia surrounding its very
mention not been so high

481
00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:55.140
in 1946 Richard Brooks's novel The Brick
Foxhole dealt with obsessive masculinity

482
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.520
in the military in it a gay decorator is
murdered by a soldier he brings home to

483
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.980
his apartment for a drink the 1947 film
adaptation Crossfire made the victim a

484
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.000
Jewish person and thus became an example
of Hollywood's maturity in dealing with

485
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.020
anti-Semitism the New York Times noted
the change in a review but said only

486
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.339
that the motivation for the murder had
been changed to good Advantage The

487
00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:21.119
novel's crucial discussion of men's
striking out at what they fear in

488
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:25.440
themselves was omitted whenever all male
circumstances were the topic of the

489
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.160
movies whether they were Cowboys sports
or Soldiers the fantasy of the

490
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.140
unfettered perennially youthful man in
pure and unsullied Brotherhood battled

491
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:39.540
over the ever-present societal taboo
against male closeness director Clarence

492
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.740
Brown toyed with this in his film flesh
and the devil in which John Gilbert and

493
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:48.000
Lars Hansen play lifelong friends who
separate when one of them marries the

494
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.260
woman they both love played by Grand
Garbo by the end of the film Garbo has

495
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.339
slept with both of them precipitating a
reluctant duel between the two men

496
00:37:56.339 --> 00:38:02.220
trying to stop them she falls through
some thin ice and drowns at this the men

497
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.960
throw down their guns Embrace and walk
off into the sunset together their arms

498
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.400
around each other their bond rejoined
following the intrusion of a woman

499
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.500
Clarence Brown spoke of the situation in
an interview you can see my problem

500
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.220
how to have these two Leading Men wind
up in each other's arms and not make

501
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.240
them look like a couple of fairies Joan
melon in her study of masculinity in the

502
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.859
movies Big Bad Wolves says that the less
violent men were in their film personas

503
00:38:28.859 --> 00:38:33.660
The more likely they were to be
interested in heterosexual love just the

504
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.640
opposite has been true for homoeroticism
the perception of homosexual feelings as

505
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.900
a brutal furtive dangerous Force
flourished in films about male bonding

506
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.339
and violence playing off of the idea of
homosexuality being innately Criminal

507
00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:51.720
gentlemen in the movies Jimmy Stewart
and any movie about small town USA would

508
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.980
never even subtextually approach such
relationships or feelings the concept of

509
00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.480
the gentleman who chooses to love other
men did not exist in American Film

510
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.320
except in comedy in the films of Laurel
and Hardy their relationship was given a

511
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.520
sweet and very real loving Dimension a
classic example of this one with

512
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.920
unmistakably gay overtones is 1932's
their first mistake Hardy's wife

513
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.300
complains that he sees too much of
Laurel and not enough of her and the two

514
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:23.160
friends discussed the situation well
what's the matter with her anyway no I

515
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.960
don't know
she says that I think more of you than I

516
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.560
do of her

517
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.960
foreign

518
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.540
but we won't go into that you know what
the whole trouble is

519
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:45.119
what what you need is a baby in your
house well what's that got to do with it

520
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:51.900
well if you've if you had a baby and it
would keep your wife's mind occupied and

521
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.520
you could go out nights with me and
she'd never think anything about it so

522
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.820
they go out and adopt a baby
when they return home with it they

523
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.599
discovered that Hardy's wife is suing
him for divorce for alienation of

524
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:08.820
affections having named Laurel as the
other woman the remainder of the film is

525
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.839
a beautifully timed and performed
domestic scene with Laurel and Hardy in

526
00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:17.160
bed with the baby between them the
obviousness of the coding has been

527
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.839
lambasted ever since the film's release
with Charles Barr in his study of Laurel

528
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:26.099
and Hardy saying that there is something
rather absurd about discussing this

529
00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:31.079
seriously at all
in the often infantile pre-sexual

530
00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:37.140
Nursery World in which Stan and Ollie
lived such Behavior would be natural I'd

531
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.460
agree that it is in fact natural but the
idea of there ever having been a

532
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.140
pre-sexual time is reaching
but notice that it is the naturalness of

533
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.740
Laurel and Hardy's behavior that Barr
and other critics choose to defend not

534
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.660
the sexuality and so it is indeed an
attack on americanism itself to suggest

535
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.800
that homosexuality is present in the
Laurel and Hearty routines in pointing

536
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.060
these things out one attacks the
American illusion the illusion that

537
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.220
there is in fact such a thing as a real
man and that to become one is as easy as

538
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.140
changing one's name from Marion Morrison
to John Wayne the fact is that comedy

539
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.460
has been able to comment on sexual roles
more readily than drama could only

540
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.740
because people may dismiss it as an
impossible first neglected buddy

541
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.300
relationships exist even in classic
cartoons while Disney may not have liked

542
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.540
hearing it but there are gay overtones
in the relationships of more than one

543
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.599
pair of beloved animated figures from
his classic years

544
00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:38.099
in 1940s Pinocchio Honest John and
Gideon a fox and a cat are best friends

545
00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:43.020
who procure Lost Boys for sale to an
evil Coachman who takes them to Pleasure

546
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.099
Island they seduce Pinocchio with the
hit song High diddly D the second line

547
00:41:47.099 --> 00:41:52.800
of which is high diddly day an actor's
life is gay in Cinderella everyone's

548
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.599
favorite mice jock and Gus Gus volunteer
to help finish Cinderella's dress in

549
00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:01.680
time for the ball
but they are quickly admonished by a

550
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.760
female Mouse to leave the sowing to the
women their relationship grows

551
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.060
throughout the film and later when
Cinderella describes how she was swept

552
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.320
off her feet by the handsome prince Gus
Gus puts an arm around Jock's shoulder

553
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.320
and holds him close
and of course from the competition there

554
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.400
was Bugs Bunny giddy to throw on a dress
and a wig at the first available

555
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.359
opportunity the real emotions in the
movies at the time with exceptions for

556
00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:28.020
films like Gone With the Wind always
took place between men

557
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.280
men had been the important forces at
work both as instigators of all the

558
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.960
action and plots and as instigators of
the films themselves by deciding what

559
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.980
movies should and should not be made
when screenwriter Gore Vidal discussed

560
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.540
the script for the 1959 version of Ben
Hur with director William Weiler they

561
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.859
concluded that the Rivalry between Judah
Ben-Hur Charlton Heston and his

562
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:54.660
boyfriend Masala Stephen Boyd was
insufficiently motivated by a single

563
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.920
political scene in which Ben Hur refuses
to Aid the Roman cause despite his

564
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.480
friend's pleas
Fidel described the problem I proposed

565
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.740
the notion that the two had been
adolescent lovers and now Masala has

566
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.140
returned from Rome wanting to revive the
love affair but Ben Hurd is not

567
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.240
he has read Leviticus and knows an
Abomination when he sees one I told

568
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.319
Wyler this is what's going on underneath
the scene

569
00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:26.640
they seem to be talking about politics
but Masala is really trying to rekindle

570
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.420
A Love Affair
and Weiler was startled

571
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.920
we discussed the matter and then he
sighed well anything is better than what

572
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.700
we've got in the way of motivation but
don't tell Chuck

573
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.000
I did tell Stephen Boyd who was
fascinated

574
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.160
he agreed to play the frustrated lover
study his face in the reaction shots in

575
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.440
that scene and you will see that he
plays it like a man starving it was 1959

576
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.540
and filmmakers were on the verge of new
creative freedoms Vidal was saying that

577
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:01.380
it made sense that the two men should be
attracted to each other

578
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.000
theirs was the most vibrant and
interesting relationship in the film

579
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.200
Weiler later told Vidal the biggest
mistake we made was the straight love

580
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.960
story
if we had cut out the girl all together

581
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.660
and concentrated on the two guys
everything would have gone better

582
00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.579
director Howard Hawks always
concentrated on men in his films and in

583
00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:25.800
his films things went better
than in Ben Hur at least in 1948's Red

584
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.060
River hawks's only use for Joe Andrew
was to have her tell John Wayne in

585
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:36.960
Montgomery Clift what we can already see
my bit expected trouble for days when

586
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.380
when anybody would have a mind would
know you two love each other yet the

587
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.579
nature of that love despite Cliff's
scene Persona doing for his character

588
00:44:44.579 --> 00:44:49.500
what Garbo did for Queen Christina
remained hidden despite one of the most

589
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.359
re-watched and arguably most homoerotic
scenes in any film at the time being one

590
00:44:54.359 --> 00:44:59.400
in which Montgomery Clift and John
Ireland compare their

591
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.660
pistols the only open acknowledgment of
the homosexuality and Buddy films came

592
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.960
from those critics who attributed the
misogynist attitudes of such films to

593
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.099
the covert gayness in them when Joseph
McBride and Gerald Perry in an interview

594
00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:16.140
in film comment questioned Hawks about
the gay undertones of his films Red

595
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.760
River in particular Hawks told them it
was a goddamn silly statement to make

596
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.200
it's easy to see how directors might be
oblivious to the subtexts that are

597
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.560
present in their own work since
homosexuality is a viable alternative

598
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:34.380
has been repressed both in the lives of
men and in their work on screen the

599
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.880
taboo against male closeness is taken
far more seriously than it is in real

600
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.339
life where it is more likely to be seen
as a neutral gay sensibility some people

601
00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:48.000
contend that there is no such thing as a
gay sensibility since the presence of

602
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.420
such a thing would imply the existence
of a straight sensibility which is

603
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.040
something that unquestionably does not
exist yet a gay sensibility can take on

604
00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.480
various forms and it is possible for it
to be present even when there is no

605
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.460
indication of homosexuality either overt
or covert in front of or behind the

606
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.480
camera the need to conceal one's sexual
orientation for such a significant

607
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.920
portion of one's life is primarily
responsible for the development of a gay

608
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.280
Sensibility
it is a ghetto sensibility that was

609
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.079
developed out of the necessity to
cultivate and employ a second site that

610
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:26.339
would interpret discreetly what the
world sees and what the actual reality

611
00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:32.040
may be it was gay sensibility that for
example often enabled some lesbians and

612
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.619
gay men to see at very early ages even
before they knew the words for what they

613
00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:40.380
were
something on the screen that they knew

614
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.760
related to their lives in some way often
it was the simple recognition of

615
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.619
difference the sudden understanding that
something was altered or not what it

616
00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:54.480
should be perhaps the role reversal of a
Dietrich or agarbo evoking a hidden

617
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.920
truth about the nature of sexuality in
general or it may have been the tone in

618
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.240
James Dean's voice as he zipped up the
jacket of the Dead salominio In Rebel

619
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.099
Without a Cause And muttered
he's always cold

620
00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:12.480
it was the sense of Yearning that was
there in these encounters the unsaid

621
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.339
forbidden desires that were always there
but were always repressed even if the

622
00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:20.460
parts did not fit together until years
later it was a voice that could not be

623
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.920
ignored with no real homosexuals allowed
on screen in the 40s and 50s sensors

624
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.500
often began looking for these hidden
messages

625
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.280
sometimes they found them even when
there were real things that were

626
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.420
abundantly clear in the film rope for
instance directed by Alfred Hitchcock in

627
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.099
1948 Farley Granger and John Dahl play
the role of two pretentious gay lovers

628
00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:44.460
who on a whim murder a former Prep
School classmate

629
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.780
they do this because they believe they
possess a superior intellect and are not

630
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:52.980
morally responsible to a crass Society
the sensor's attention was drawn not to

631
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.280
the exact relationship between the
characters but rather to the discourse

632
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.700
between them Arthur Lawrence recalls
that when he finished his screenplay for

633
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:04.319
rope he left England for America and
while he was in America the script was

634
00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:09.060
passed on by American censors rope came
from an English play called rope's end

635
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.800
and while I was in New York the producer
Sydney Bernstein took a few passages

636
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.740
from the play and put them back in the
script

637
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.720
so when it came back from the Hayes
office every one of those passages was

638
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.700
circled with the common homosexual
dialogue written in the margin and do

639
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.300
you know what they were it was simply
that they were saying things like my

640
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.140
dear boy to each other and the way that
the English talked was known as fruity

641
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.560
over here it's actually a long-held myth
within film circles that the reason

642
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.420
Hitchcock filmed rope to appear as one
long unedited take was so that sensors

643
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:46.619
would be unable to force him to cut any
perceived gay content without altering

644
00:48:46.619 --> 00:48:50.760
the artistic intent of the film there
were also other more covert homosexual

645
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.900
relationships in Hitchcock films such as
the one between Martin Landau and James

646
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.579
Mason North by Northwest and more
strikingly the one between Robert Walker

647
00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:03.540
and Farley Granger in strangers on a
train nonetheless the filmmaker only

648
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.440
seldom offered commentary on matters of
this nature regarding his work but

649
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.520
Arthur Lawrence later said we never
discussed hitch and I whether the

650
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.839
characters in rope were homosexuals but
I thought it was apparent I guess he did

651
00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:20.099
too but it never came up until we got to
Casting we'd wanted Cary Grant for the

652
00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:23.099
teacher in Montgomery Clift for one of
the boys and they both turned it down

653
00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:27.720
for the same reason their image
they felt they couldn't risk it

654
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.040
eventually John Dahl and Farley Granger
played the boys and they were very aware

655
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.000
of what they were doing he also stated
that Robert Walker was the one who

656
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.480
suggested playing Bruno Anthony as a gay
character in the film strangers on a

657
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.859
train the strangeness of their agreement
was emphasized by the friction that it

658
00:49:43.859 --> 00:49:48.240
caused between his malignantly Faye
Bruno and Granger's golly gee tennis

659
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.920
player guy Haynes in compensation for
the death of Bruno's despised father guy

660
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.000
agreed to take the life of Bruno's
undesirable wife and put an end to guy's

661
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.520
marriage Bruno's homosexuality emerged
in phrases that would be used

662
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.480
progressively during the 50s to describe
gays as aliens because of his icy

663
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:11.220
demeanor his dark imagination and the
elitist superiority that he exuded he

664
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.660
was an extension of the clever but
lethal archetype Philip and

665
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.040
Brandon the lovers in rope were warped
individuals who murdered out of a belief

666
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.140
in their own moral and intellectual
superiority which they believed placed

667
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.000
them outside the law by existing outside
the culture such gays were able to deny

668
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.400
explicit homosexuality while at the same
time reinforcing specific stereotypes

669
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.240
this is how Oscar Wilde's The Picture of
Dorian Gray could reach the screen in

670
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.220
1945 shorn of its more bizarre sexual
implications while offering George

671
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.400
Saunders as a symbol of sophisticated
decadence

672
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.800
such ghettoized characters pre-saged the
gay as alien images of the 1950s and had

673
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.680
their roots in the same
anti-intellectualism and mistrust of

674
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.280
difference that had characterized the
shaping of Hollywood's image of the

675
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.960
normal American man the view of the
homosexual as being alien to his own

676
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.059
Society was also present in the constant
deletion of specific homosexuality from

677
00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:13.859
the screen adaptations of literary Works
in 1945 Billy Wilder brought Charles

678
00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:18.420
Jackson's novel The Lost weekend to the
screen with Ray Milland as the alcoholic

679
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.400
writer Don Burnham in Jackson's novel
Burnham's alcoholism stems from a

680
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:28.260
complex variety of reasons that include
a father fixation and a false accusation

681
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.280
of his having had a gay relationship
with a college frat brother in Wilder's

682
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.520
version of the Lost weekend however the
motivation for Burnham's drinking

683
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.480
becomes a simple case of writer's block
the only frames of reference for the

684
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.319
majority of gay people were these covert
signals and hidden indicators of

685
00:51:43.319 --> 00:51:46.859
homosexuality in Hollywood movies the
majority of gay people learned about

686
00:51:46.859 --> 00:51:50.880
themselves mostly through movies that
stated the rest of the world was

687
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.980
straight a documentary entitled word is
out which was released in 1977

688
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.559
demonstrated that the majority of gay
people living in the United States had

689
00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:01.680
the misconception that they were the
only ones like them in the entire world

690
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.099
several years later when the Supreme
Court finally ruled that it wasn't

691
00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:09.480
obscene to portray homosexual content on
screen films that were more overtly gay

692
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.960
helped pave the way for the
legitimization of homosexual subject

693
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.460
matter on screen nonetheless throughout
the early and middle part of the 1950s

694
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.319
the invisibility of homosexuality was
enforced with an almost fanatical

695
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:27.000
paranoia the perversity of the outsider
the Oddball or the alien screen

696
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.099
character was very noticeable in an era
built around rigid Conformity such as

697
00:52:32.099 --> 00:52:36.599
the 1950s the equation between being
different in any way

698
00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:42.660
and being gay was easy to see
in 1952's my son John Dean Jagger and

699
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.920
Helen Hayes played the distraught
parents of a young man who is

700
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.180
well not gay but a communist agent
played by Robert Walker when their

701
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.960
suspicions about their son's activities
are confirmed it's an American Tragedy

702
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.760
suddenly they see their son as Shifty
and unfamiliar a thing with no respect

703
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.599
for God or country an unprincipled
monster to whom they can no longer

704
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:07.619
relate

contempt for his parents and their way

unnaturalness in a 1950 New York Times

707
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:20.460
story The Republican National committee
chairman asserted that sexual perverts

708
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:25.380
who have infiltrated our government in
recent years are perhaps as dangerous as

709
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.540
actual Communists by December of that
year

710
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.900
4954 suspected homosexuals had been
removed from employment in the federal

government the lavender scare was
gripping Washington and with the help of

712
00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:44.700
a future president would soon dig its
claws deep into Hollywood as well

foreign
[Music]

714
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.140
in the early 20th century the United
States experienced a period of political

715
00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.119
persecution and anxiety known as the Red
Scare there were two different eras in

716
00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:03.119
American history that are collectively
known as the Red Scare both of which

717
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:08.040
were marked by widespread anxiety over
communism and other leftist ideas the

718
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.700
first Red Scare happened in the wake of
World War One and is rarely spoken about

719
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:16.500
and the second occurred in the midst of
the Cold War in the late 1940s and early

720
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.960
1950s to a considerable extent the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was to

721
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.680
blame for the onset of the first Red
Scare it's no secret that many Americans

722
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.859
especially those in positions of
authority were worried about the

723
00:54:28.859 --> 00:54:33.059
emergence of the Soviet Union and the
expansion of Communism in Europe in

724
00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:36.359
response to this perceived threat the
American government enacted a set of

725
00:54:36.359 --> 00:54:41.359
laws intended to limit the freedoms of
those who were either Communists or

726
00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:46.559
sympathizers of the Communist cause the
Sedition Act of 1918 was one of the most

727
00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:50.700
notorious pieces of legislation enacted
at the time because it made it a crime

728
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:55.020
to criticize is the government anyone
suspected of being a communist or

729
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:59.220
Anarchist was subject to prosecution
under these statutes regardless of

730
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.119
whether or not they had committed any
real crimes the American Protective

731
00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:06.839
League was one of the several private
groups formed during the first Red Scare

732
00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:11.520
with the authority to investigate and
report on suspected subversives during

733
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.180
the height of the Red Scare the American
Legion spearheaded a drive to identify

734
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.920
and punish suspected traitors after
World War II tensions between the United

735
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.300
States and the Soviet Union grew once
again sparking the second Red Scare

736
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.380
during this time communism was again
considered a major danger to American

737
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:32.700
democracy and its way of life the
inquiry undertaken by Senator Joseph

738
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.619
McCarthy known as the McCarthy hearings
was one of the most important events of

739
00:55:37.619 --> 00:55:41.160
the second Red Scare McCarthy claimed to
have a list of people who were either

740
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.680
Communist party members or sympathizers
and he used his position in government

741
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.420
to initiate a series of Investigations
and interrogations to flush them out

742
00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.280
dramatic confrontations and high profile
charges typified the McCarthy hearings

743
00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.660
which had far-reaching effects on
American culture many individuals were

744
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.859
punished for their suspected communist
links even though there was no proof to

745
00:56:04.859 --> 00:56:08.819
back up the claims Witnesses were
questioned under duress throughout the

746
00:56:08.819 --> 00:56:13.140
trials to get them to identify other
Communists who were under suspicion even

747
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:18.240
if they were judged not to be communist
supporters many people were blacklisted

748
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.960
and lost their employment as a
consequence of the proceedings because

749
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.660
of McCarthy and his associates harsh
methods and disregard for due process

750
00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:32.520
the hearings became notorious
but the hearings came to an end in 1954

751
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.940
when McCarthy was censured by the senate
for his conduct during the

752
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.660
investigations marking the beginning of
the end of McCarthy's political career

753
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:45.000
the hearings are now widely viewed as a
dark chapter in American history in 1950

754
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.500
many politicians journalists and
citizens thought that homosexuals

755
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.400
actually posed more of a threat to
National Security than Communists one

756
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.359
columnist argued there is no record of
comparable corruption in American

757
00:56:57.359 --> 00:57:02.819
history in a national radio broadcast
noted liberal Elmer Davis said it looks

758
00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:06.599
as if the enemies of the state
department and of the administration

759
00:57:06.599 --> 00:57:11.280
generally have gotten hold of a more
profitable issue than communism Senator

760
00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.900
Kenneth weary asked his Senate
colleagues can you think of a person who

761
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:22.500
would be more dangerous to the United
States than a pervert and multiple of

762
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:27.420
President Harry Truman's top advisors
wrote him memos stating the country is

763
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:32.460
more concerned about the charges of
 sexuals in government than about

764
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:39.119
Communists in the UK it was just about
social Purity yet in America the

765
00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:42.780
existence of gay men specifically was
somehow a matter of life and death

766
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.040
historians of the McCarthy period have
paid surprisingly little attention to

767
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.180
the lavender scare despite the
widespread worry and even Panic it

768
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.619
caused at the time the significance of
Party politics and foreign policy in the

769
00:57:55.619 --> 00:57:59.819
emergence of the National Security State
is emphasized by political historians of

770
00:57:59.819 --> 00:58:04.079
McCarthyism anti-communism and the
establishment of the National Security

771
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:09.720
State while the role of moral and
cultural concerns is downplayed anytime

772
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.300
the lavender scare is discussed it is as
an afterthought of the Red Scare that is

773
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:20.040
so obvious that it doesn't ever need
explanation the overlapping worries of

774
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.520
Communism and homosexuality have been
largely ignored in even the most recent

775
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:27.540
examinations of McCarthyism both
defenses from the right and criticisms

776
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:32.099
from the left many people who supported
McCarthy back in the 1950s considered

777
00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:35.400
the systemic expulsion of gays from the
state department and other government

778
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:41.280
positions to be his most lasting
achievement senator Joseph McCarthy

779
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.559
alleged in February of 1950 that there
were 205 Communists working in the state

780
00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:50.819
department that's a month under
Secretary of State John Purifoy said

781
00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:56.099
that the state department had permitted
91 homosexuals to retire after this some

782
00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:59.819
said the president Harry Truman's
government was insufficiently concerned

783
00:58:59.819 --> 00:59:03.240
about the threat posed by homosexuals
the Senate started looking into

784
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.440
homosexuals working for the government
in June of 1950. although the findings

785
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.099
weren't made public until December
throughout that time there was a sharp

786
00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:15.180
rise in the number of government
employees let go because of homophobic

787
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:19.799
harassment or discrimination when asked
about quote sexual perverts who have

788
00:59:19.799 --> 00:59:23.819
infiltrated our government in recent
years Republican National chairman guy

789
00:59:23.819 --> 00:59:28.319
George gabrielson claimed that they were
perhaps as dangerous as the actual

790
00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:32.099
Communists however being homosexual
wasn't the only reason they were in

791
00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:36.119
danger homosexuals were observed as
security threats because they were

792
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:40.619
believed to be more vulnerable to
Blackmail as top counsel of his

793
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:45.240
Congressional subcommittee McCarthy
employed Roy Cohn who himself was

794
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.799
homosexual and died of AIDS decades
later because of his attempts to protect

795
00:59:49.799 --> 00:59:54.180
his reputation he insisted that his
doctor treat him for liver cancer so at

796
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.240
the same time that his immune system was
dying he was undergoing Cancer

797
00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.540
Treatments that destroyed what was left
of his white blood cells at the same

798
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:04.260
time he also pulled what strings he
could to get on the experimental HIV

799
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.579
medication that was still undergoing
medical trials AZT which

800
01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:13.020
destroyed his liver someday we will
progress as a community to the point

801
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.220
where the only remaining Legacy of Roy
Cohn is as the villain of Tony kushner's

802
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.500
iconic stage play angels in America
but we're not quite there yet because

803
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.359
Cohn and McCarthy with the help of FBI
director J Edgar Hoover who is also

804
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:31.079
believed to have been gay were
responsible for the dismissal of

805
01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:34.920
thousands of gay government employees
and the intimidation of many of their

806
01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.240
political opponents into Silence by
spreading false allegations about their

807
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.160
sexual orientation the state department
revealed that it had dismissed 425

808
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.579
workers due to charges of homosexuality
in the closing months of the Truman

809
01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:52.440
Administration in 1953. McCarthy's
anti-communist campaign often fused the

810
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.940
second Red Scare with the lavender scare
by using allegations of homosexuality as

811
01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.380
a smear tactic reporters were once
subjected to the following statement if

812
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.280
you want to be against McCarthy Boys
you've got to either be a communist or a

813
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.359
 when proof of communist
activity was absent McCarthy allegedly

814
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:13.319
used guilt by association by equating
communism and homosexuality with mental

815
01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:17.760
instability the general public and even
politicians had a common view that gays

816
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.640
and Communists were both morally weak or
psychologically Disturbed as well as

817
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:28.200
Godless and destructive to traditional
families for instance McCarthy openly

818
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.760
discussed two individuals case 14 and
case 62 on the senate floor as

819
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.280
Communists who posed unsafe risks due to
their homosexuality he said that a

820
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.760
high-ranking intelligence officer had
informed him that every active communist

821
01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.260
is Twisted mentally or physically
implying that those with the peculiar

822
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:51.240
mental twists of homosexuality were more
susceptible to recruitment by Communists

823
01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.680
many of the male workers at the state
department started to feel uncomfortable

824
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.920
even being there because of the
Department's new association with

825
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.180
homosexuality they were quite adamant
about not being seen in pairs and they

826
01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:07.079
often introduced themselves with words
emphasizing their straightness hi I'm so

827
01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:09.660
and so I work for the state department
and I'm married and I have three

828
01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.579
children executive order 104.50 enacted
by President Eisenhower in 1953

829
01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:18.240
prohibited gays from holding federal
government positions and established

830
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.140
security criteria for federal employment
as a direct result of these policies

831
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:27.599
hundreds of only gay State Department
employees were outed and fired about 5

832
01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:31.920
000 gay individuals including private
contractors and military personnel lost

833
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.480
their jobs at the federal government as
a result of this presidential order the

834
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.059
victims were not only fired from
employment

835
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:43.260
but also outed to the public this
presidential order expanded Truman's

836
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.760
loyalty program by including sexual
perversion among the actions that

837
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.020
disqualified a person from holding a
federal post many new rules and

838
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.520
practices were implemented to identify
and expel persons who identify as

839
01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.440
homosexual lesbian or bisexual it was
common practice to conduct interviews

840
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.420
and check for overt displays of
homosexual biases as part of these new

841
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.619
methods to detect gaze people were
judged guilty not just by connection

842
01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:14.640
with those who frequented the same
homosexual clubs as the suspects they

843
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.660
may also be questioned if members of
their immediate or extended family had

844
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.760
gay Tendencies or gay connections by the
mid-1950s similar repressive and

845
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.420
oppressive policies had been enacted in
States and local governments as well

846
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.819
expanding bans on hiring lesbians and
gay men to cover 12 million workers more

847
01:03:32.819 --> 01:03:37.200
than 20 percent of the United States
labor force all of whom were required to

848
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.119
sign Oaths attesting to their moral
Purity in order to obtain or maintain

849
01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:46.140
employment but McCarthy's crew of
homophobes were about to have the sites

850
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:50.280
trained on themselves when Roy Cohn
brought on G David shine as Chief

851
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.119
consultant to the McCarthy staff
speculation arose that shine and Cohn

852
01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:58.380
had a sexual relationship during the
Army McCarthy hearings Cohn denied being

853
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.460
closer than an ordinary friend to shine
or having any special interest in him

854
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.359
Army Council Joseph Welch seemed to
elude to cohn's sexual orientation

855
01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:11.240
throughout the proceedings did you think
this came from

856
01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:18.839
Define
he might be an expert on that yeah yeah

857
01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:23.760
I should say
I should say Mr Senator that a pixie is

858
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.559
a close relative of a fairy McCarthy's
unwavering support for cone fueled

859
01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:32.940
rumors that the senator was either
coerced by his senior counsel or that

860
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:37.500
their relationship went beyond
professional boundaries McCarthy often

861
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:42.119
engaged in homosexual activities Nevada
publisher Hank Greenspun said in 1952

862
01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:45.059
and claimed that he was a regular at the
White Horse Inn

863
01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:49.020
a Milwaukee gay nightclub all this
attention eventually led to Roy Cohn

864
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.220
being removed from his post alongside
McCarthy and helped fuel McCarthy's own

865
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.359
downfall in due time the McCarthy period
as a whole came to an end in the middle

866
01:04:57.359 --> 01:05:02.339
of the 1950s when Nicole V young
judgment in 1956 significantly reduced

867
01:05:02.339 --> 01:05:06.180
the authority to remove anyone from the
federal government with discriminatory

868
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.619
grounds however the lavender scare
continued for many more decades the

869
01:05:10.619 --> 01:05:13.859
Florida legislative investigative
committee also known as the Johns

870
01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:17.460
committee or flick was another
manifestation of the lavender scare that

871
01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:24.540
endured established in 1956 the flick
lasted until 1964 before being dissolved

872
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.900
the committee's mission in Florida was
to investigate and fire homosexual

873
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.339
Public School teachers carrying on the
lavender scare and spirit if not

874
01:05:32.339 --> 01:05:36.359
entirely in practice and it wasn't until
the Obama Administration that military

875
01:05:36.359 --> 01:05:40.440
service for openly gay people was
allowed since the don't ask don't tell

876
01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:46.920
policy was just another executive order
104.50 under a different name but though

877
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.700
the lavender scare unofficially came to
an end with the fall of McCarthyism

878
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.480
after multiple Decisions by the Supreme
Court defang the senator and left him

879
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:59.220
nothing but a paper tiger The Fear and
Loathing toward homosexuals as well as

880
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:05.700
accused Communists survived much longer
in Hollywood even before McCarthy began

881
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:09.780
his Crusade producers in California had
been blacklisting anyone even remotely

882
01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:13.319
connected to Communism thanks to
pressure from future president of the

883
01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:16.859
United States Ronald Reagan who was then
the president of the Screen Actors Guild

884
01:06:16.859 --> 01:06:20.700
many Hollywood professionals were called
to appear before the house on American

885
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:25.440
Activities Committee in October of 1947.
it was announced that the committee

886
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.460
would look into allegations that
communist spies and supporters had

887
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:34.319
planted propaganda in Hollywood movies
Walt Disney spoke first during the

888
01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:38.640
proceedings Disney testified that
Communists posed a severe danger to the

889
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.140
film business and identified many former
employees as possible Communists in

890
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:47.280
contrast other leading Hollywood figures
including director John Houston and

891
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.599
actors Humphrey Bogart Lauren Bacall
Judy Garland and Danny Kaye organized

892
01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:54.900
the committee for the First Amendment to
protest the government's targeting of

893
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.440
the film industry of the people working
in Hollywood that the house on American

894
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.339
Activities Committee was interested in
many were accused of being members of

895
01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:07.740
the communist Party USA of the initial
witness list of 43 19 declared that they

896
01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.640
would not give evidence 11 of the
original 19 were questioned by the panel

897
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.859
on Monday October 27th the hearings last
phase began and members of the committee

898
01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:19.980
for the First Amendment traveled in from
throughout the country

899
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:25.920
to participate only one of the 11
unfriendly Witnesses writer Bertolt

900
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.480
Breck agreed to speak with the committee
after which he fled the country ten

901
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.740
others declined claiming their right to
free expression and assembly under the

902
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:39.839
First Amendment the question are you now
or have you ever been a member of the

903
01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:43.980
Communist party was one which they flat
out refused to answer the committee

904
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.819
formally accused these ten of contempt
of congress and began criminal

905
01:07:47.819 --> 01:07:51.180
proceedings against them in the Full
House of Representatives the house on

906
01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.299
American Activities Committee hearings
failed to turn up any evidence that

907
01:07:54.299 --> 01:07:57.720
Hollywood was secretly disseminating
communist propaganda but the industry

908
01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.579
was nonetheless transformed producers
and Studio heads were now on the watch

909
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:07.200
for any and all anti-American activity
fearing further investigation from the

910
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.520
government especially ones that might
lead to government censorship which

911
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.739
they'd only narrowly avoided decades
before so as Hollywood always does they

912
01:08:16.739 --> 01:08:21.540
chose to self-censor before being told
to this began a Crackdown on any

913
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.699
directors writers or actors who might be
communist or gay The Echoes of

914
01:08:26.699 --> 01:08:30.779
McCarthyism were sounding loudly in the
Hollywood Hills and the association

915
01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:34.679
between gay and communist were
inseparable by then and as mentioned in

916
01:08:34.679 --> 01:08:37.920
previous episodes Hollywood was more or
less stuffed full of gay men and women

917
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.060
working in any one of a multitude of
roles in the industry this resulted in

918
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:46.140
multiple well-respected directors moving
to Europe and sending many more

919
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:50.100
up-and-coming and well-established
actors even further into the closet

920
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.000
suddenly films about the fear of
extraterrestrials became hot tickets in

921
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.020
Hollywood as a narrative device to help
instill fear of anything even slightly

922
01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.920
different to the masses of the growing
Suburban America these monsters from

923
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.060
outer space were Communists gays and
people of color these aliens could be

924
01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.500
anything and everything John and Martha
were afraid of which thanks to Senator

925
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.759
McCarthy
was a lot of things but no theme was

926
01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:17.759
more prevalent than the alien
shapeshifter the ones who could live

927
01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:22.020
alongside the normal people corrupting
them from within Communists coming for

928
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.460
your husbands gays coming for your sons
the Red Scare and the dread of communist

929
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.199
infiltration into American culture are
commonly seen as metaphors in the 1956

930
01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:35.219
science fiction classic Invasion of the
Body Snatchers the film has also been

931
01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:38.580
seen as a homosexual allegory by any
number of reviewers and Scholars

932
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.279
throughout the years the film's
narrative revolves around an

933
01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:45.060
extraterrestrial invasion of Earth and
the subsequent infiltration of soulless

934
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:50.219
carbon copy humans developed in pods the
Pod inhabitants begin to symbolize as

935
01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:55.140
the film unfolds a society that is
driven by uniformity and tries to

936
01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.060
eliminate individuality and uniqueness
this uniformity and Conformity theme has

937
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.540
been linked to the gay experience in the
1950s ever since

938
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.140
many gay individuals in the past were
pressured to conceal their identities

939
01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.980
and mask their sexual orientation
because of the widespread stigma

940
01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.580
associated with being gay at the time
the film's depiction of the pod people

941
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:18.900
paints them as robotic drones devoid a
feeling and individuality in addition

942
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:22.920
the film's characters are a misfit crew
that the perceived conventional Society

943
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.179
Rejects and ignores people who insist
that something nefarious is occurring

944
01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:31.980
are sometimes branded as insane or
paranoid similar to the experiences of

945
01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.679
gay people who were frequently
disregarded and mocked by the larger

946
01:10:34.679 --> 01:10:38.460
society the characters in this story are
members of a minority group who are

947
01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:43.440
trying to persuade the world of a threat
that only they can see Invasion of the

948
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.800
Body Snatchers is undoubtedly a film
that reflects the societal anxieties of

949
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.880
its time and can also be seen as a
powerful gay allegory by exploring

950
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.140
themes of Conformity individuality and
marginalization the film speaks to the

951
01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:59.280
experiences of many gay people who
struggle to find Acceptance in a society

952
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.679
that sought to erase their differences
Invaders from Mars features a similar

953
01:11:04.679 --> 01:11:08.640
plot to Invasion of the Body Snatchers
David the film's protagonist is a

954
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.600
creative and sensitive young man who is
ridiculed and excluded from school he

955
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.560
has a difficult time relating to people
even his own father with whom he has a

956
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.400
tense relationship many members of the
queer Community especially around the

957
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.760
time the film was released have
experienced feelings of alienation and

958
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.140
exclusion similar to those shown in the
film actor Arthur Franz who plays

959
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.800
David's father in the film has been
speculated to be homosexual in real life

960
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.719
Morris ankrum who was also thought to be
gay plays Dr kelston an investigator of

961
01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:42.480
the UFO phenomena there are aspects in
Invaders from Mars that may be seen via

962
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.260
a queer lens even if that wasn't the
film's original intent from the

963
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.380
underlying ties between the male
characters to the overt themes of

964
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.600
possession and Invasion the 1939 film
nanochka has also been interpreted by

965
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.500
film critics as an allegory for lesbian
desire and love firstly the character of

966
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.420
Nina played by Greta Garbo is a Stern
and serious Soviet Envoy who comes to

967
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.739
Paris to supervise a group of three
bumbling comrades who have been sent

968
01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:12.060
there to sell Jewels seized during the
Russian Revolution Nina is initially

969
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:17.340
portrayed as cold and unfeeling but she
begins to thaw as she falls in love with

970
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:22.140
the Charming and carefree count Leon
dalgol played by Melvin Douglas this

971
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.800
Dynamic of a strict and buttoned up
woman being seduced by a more carefree

972
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.560
and flamboyant man is a common Trope in
Classic Hollywood films but it also

973
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.420
mirrors the expectation that more manly
or serious women would lighten up and go

974
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.440
straight eventually the Assumption among
many was after all that the only thing

975
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.860
stopping a lesbian from being a happy
Homemaker was finding the right man

976
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:49.140
finally there is the character of Irma
played by Bella Lugosi Irma is portrayed

977
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.520
as a flamboyant and Theatrical figure
with a campy and exaggerated manner of

978
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.880
speaking and gesturing while the
character is not explicitly identified

979
01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.840
as queer the fact that Lugosi himself
was bisexual and often played roles with

980
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.679
homoerotic undertones has led some
viewers to interpret Irma as a coded

981
01:13:04.679 --> 01:13:09.000
representation of queer desire and from
a completely opposite direction we have

982
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.920
the notorious Plan 9 from Outer Space
from the infamous filmmaker Ed Wood

983
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.179
while the film has long been considered
a cinematic disaster it has also been

984
01:13:18.179 --> 01:13:22.980
celebrated for its campy subversive
qualities in particular many critics and

985
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.940
Scholars have interpreted the film as a
queer allegory one way in which the film

986
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.540
can be seen as a queer allegory is
through the character of the alien

987
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:36.360
leader Eros Eros is portrayed as a
flamboyant effeminate figure with his

988
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.460
distinctive attire makeup and mannerisms
he moves with a graceful almost poetic

989
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.600
quality and his speech is melodramatic
and Theatrical his characterization is

990
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.159
so exaggerated that it goes well beyond
mere stereotyping and instead creates a

991
01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:54.719
queer icon that challenges and subverts
traditional gender Norms another aspect

992
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:57.960
of the film that can be interpreted as a
queer allegory is its underlying

993
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.040
critique of Conformity the plot revolves
around the alien's plan to destroy Earth

994
01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.600
because they view it as a threat to
their own culture and way of life this

995
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.260
can be seen as a commentary on the
obsessive forces of Conformity that

996
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:14.520
queer individuals have often faced the
aliens desire for uniformity and

997
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.840
sameness can be read as a metaphor for
the societal pressures to conform to

998
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.980
heteronormative standards and
expectations and even the internal

999
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.820
expectations of the queer Community
finally the film's low budget campy

1000
01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.659
style can be seen as a celebration of
the marginal and the underground

1001
01:14:30.659 --> 01:14:35.760
in the context of queer culture Camp has
often been used as a way to resist and

1002
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.020
subvert dominant cultural norms the
film's deliberately bad acting special

1003
01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.340
effects and overall production value can
be seen as a queer refusal to conform to

1004
01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.000
traditional Hollywood standards or maybe
I'm reaching a bit with that one but

1005
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.159
suffice to say the 1950s were a time of
strict social conformity in America the

1006
01:14:53.159 --> 01:14:56.520
culture was dominated by the ideal of
the nuclear family where a husband

1007
01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.940
worked and provided for his wife and
children while the wife stayed at home

1008
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:04.199
and took care of the household
any deviation from this Norm was

1009
01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:09.900
considered dangerously deviant and
subject to social ostracization this of

1010
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:14.580
course included homosexuality which was
widely seen as a mental illness or a

1011
01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:18.659
moral failing gay people in the 1950s
faced significant oppression from the

1012
01:15:18.659 --> 01:15:23.040
dominant culture as well as legal and
social sanctions homosexuality was

1013
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.940
illegal in every state and those who
were caught engaging in same-sex

1014
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:31.199
activities could face imprisonment or
institutionalization in Mental Hospitals

1015
01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:35.219
in this culture of fear and secrecy gay
people were forced to hide their true

1016
01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:40.800
selves and Lead double lives whereas
suspected communist agents chose to lead

1017
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.820
double lives many gay men and women were
also forced into marriages with the

1018
01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:48.540
opposite sex in order to maintain
appearances and avoid suspicion these

1019
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.440
marriages were often unhappy and
unfulfilling for both partners and they

1020
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.640
often ended in divorce or estrangement
this further reinforced the idea that

1021
01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.780
homosexuality was a choice and that gay
people could choose to be straight if

1022
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.140
they wanted to gays and lesbians were
also subject to violence and

1023
01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:08.100
discrimination in many areas gay bars
were the only places where they could

1024
01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:12.360
meet and socialize however these spaces
were often raided by police who would

1025
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.380
arrest patrons and subject them to
violence and humiliation These Bars were

1026
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:21.060
actually rated more often than suspected
communist hideouts gays and lesbians

1027
01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.300
were considered easier targets by the
police and since the government believed

1028
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.960
a queer person could easily be turned
communist arresting them was killing two

1029
01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.920
birds with one stone the policing of
gender norms and the emphasis on

1030
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.480
Conformity made it nearly impossible for
gays and lesbians to be themselves and

1031
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.739
live fulfilling lives it wasn't until
the Stonewall riots of 1969 and the

1032
01:16:40.739 --> 01:16:44.640
subsequent gay rights movement that
things began to change in America but

1033
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.800
Hollywood would begin to ease up on the
depiction of gay people in the 1960s

1034
01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.900
but mostly in coded ways but even with
deep deep coding

1035
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.860
there was a catch
anyone confirmed to be gay or even

1036
01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:03.360
heavily coded to be
wouldn't have it easy and to live a life

1037
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.760
true to themselves
they might just have to die for it

1038
01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:15.780
[Music]

1039
01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.340
as the film industry moved away from
Suburban Perfection the extensive

1040
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:24.900
efforts made by Hollywood to conceal
homosexuality and film during the

1041
01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:30.120
post-war lavender scare era began to
deteriorate and then Hollywood came to

1042
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.420
realize that they were ignoring a large
audience

1043
01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:38.340
no not gays at the time the lifeblood of
Hollywood was relationship dramas Disney

1044
01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.659
and fleisure cartoons and biblical epics
however they ultimately realized that a

1045
01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:46.380
group of Americans with disposable
income but little to spend it on was

1046
01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:51.360
being excluded
teenagers who were incensed to fight

1047
01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:55.800
back against their parents conservative
confining outlook on life this

1048
01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.600
rebellious nature spawned arguably the
most famous adolescent dissident film

1049
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.640
ever made Rebel Without a Cause the film
contained broad Illusions to alternative

1050
01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.260
sexual behavior and the Alternatives
offered by gang ritualism Plato played

1051
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.219
by salminio is the Loneliest and most
troubled of the three problematic

1052
01:18:14.219 --> 01:18:17.580
adolescents in the film the other two
being James Dean and Natalie Wood

1053
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.300
although he is not accused of it Plato
was raised by a domineering housekeeper

1054
01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:25.800
in the absence of his father which at
the time was considered fertile breeding

1055
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.840
ground for homosexuality Plato is a
multi-faceted character who challenges

1056
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.219
traditional gender and sexuality Norms
he's a sensitive and artistic young man

1057
01:18:35.219 --> 01:18:40.320
who admires James Dean's gym and aspires
to be like him their relationship is not

1058
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.440
explicitly sexual but homoerotic tension
permeates it Plato's attraction to Jim

1059
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.400
originates from his need for a mask role
model in his life who can offer him the

1060
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.199
emotional support that he lacks at home
Jim is a troubled teenager who struggles

1061
01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:58.980
to blend in with his peers and family
nevertheless Jim's sensitivity and

1062
01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:03.480
emotional vulnerability contradict his
society's expectations of masculine

1063
01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.040
Behavior he is also drawn to Plato
despite being confined by the street

1064
01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.500
gang culture of the 1950s the writer of
the film Stuart stem said the gang in

1065
01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.400
Rebel Without a Cause isn't much
different from the Army both the rituals

1066
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.719
are tribal the affection and gang
Behavior has to be hidden inside a

1067
01:19:21.719 --> 01:19:27.000
different vocabulary both spoken and
unspoken inside gestures and Words which

1068
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.320
desensitized everything and made
everything brutal also they had to wear

1069
01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.940
skins to keep the image intact boots and
leather they had to put on a horse skin

1070
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.020
in order to feel defended against the
discovery of their own Sensitivity I

1071
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.219
don't know what other experiences in
World War II were but for us it was

1072
01:19:44.219 --> 01:19:47.460
deliberate and conscious
we were told that the buddy system

1073
01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:52.560
prevailed the choice of a buddy was as
or more critical than that of a bride

1074
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.640
you'd be living in a kind of physical
intimacy which was unlike any other men

1075
01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.600
were having the experience of never
having been so close to other men and

1076
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.020
there was something of that love
operating within the structure of the

1077
01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.340
teenage gang whose members had left home
where there wasn't much love

1078
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:13.199
to fight each other in the streets
fighting may have been a pretext for

1079
01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:17.100
being close and Rebel Without a Cause
when Jim and Buzz another gang

1080
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:21.120
Associated teen decided to enter a
chicken race to the edge of a cliff a

1081
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.080
race in which buzz will die the two
regard each other for a moment and

1082
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.920
question their participation in such an
event their encounter becomes the

1083
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:33.840
motivation for all that follows Jim
refuses to deny his feelings and in the

1084
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.500
screenplay stem uses the character's
guilt and grief over the death of Buzz

1085
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.480
as a weapon against Conformity one of
the things I wanted to show in Rebel is

1086
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.520
that underneath all the macho
defense there was that Pure Drive for

1087
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.000
affection and didn't matter who the
recipient might be

1088
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.540
there was a longer time in those days
for young men to be in that Warrior

1089
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.679
phase where a lot of romantic
attachments were formed before

1090
01:20:58.679 --> 01:21:02.520
heterosexual encounters happened my
favorite moment in the film is not

1091
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:07.320
between Jim and Plato but between Jim
and Buzz who dies in the chicken race it

1092
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.060
was tender and loving and the killing of
that boy whom Jim had known for all of

1093
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:16.860
12 minutes motivated the entire last
half of the film additionally Rebel

1094
01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:20.280
Without a Cause challenges the
conventional gender roles of women in

1095
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.540
society as well Natalie Wood portrays
Judy Jim's girlfriend who struggles to

1096
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:27.960
find her position in a man's world
Judy's relationship with Jim is

1097
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.020
complicated because they struggle to
express their emotions to one another

1098
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:35.159
however Judy's character is also
noteworthy because she challenges

1099
01:21:35.159 --> 01:21:39.300
conventional Notions of femininity she
opposes the role of the passive

1100
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.679
submissive woman in favor of asserting
her autonomy and agency the release of

1101
01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:48.179
pent-up emotions due to this type of
emotional repression is what ultimately

1102
01:21:48.179 --> 01:21:54.060
kills buzz and Plato while Jim is secure
in Judy's arms clearly adult

1103
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.380
responsibilities include settling down
in a heterosexual relationship contrary

1104
01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:03.840
to the illusions of your teenage years
homosexuality is deemed ignorable

1105
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:09.300
until the end of adolescence after that
it's considered a sort of sign of

1106
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.920
Arrested Development as we entered the
latter half of the 1950s and beginning

1107
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.300
of the 1960s this appeared to be
Hollywood's perspective on homosexuality

1108
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.560
as well theoretically gay characters
could exist in Hollywood films but only

1109
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.960
with one of two conclusions either they
straighten themselves out or they die

1110
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.520
and Hollywood was not hesitant to make
films expressing this to the audience

1111
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:37.739
burying your gaze in media has existed
for much longer than Twitter and Tumblr

1112
01:22:37.739 --> 01:22:42.420
may think TN sympathy is a classic
example of repression through coercion

1113
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:46.920
the play and film have become so
emblematic of the traditional remedy for

1114
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.940
homosexuality securing the love of a
decent woman in the nick of time that

1115
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:56.520
people have forgotten that it's actually
a tale about a timid heterosexual Robert

1116
01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.600
Anderson who adapted his own play for
the big screen in 1956 employs the

1117
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.659
classic Outsider archetype of the man
who marches to the beat of a different

1118
01:23:03.659 --> 01:23:08.520
drummer and must endure the red ridicule
of his peers in neither the film nor the

1119
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.120
play as it ever suggested that the
sensitive student Tom Lee might prefer

1120
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.860
men over women the issue at hand is the
allegation of homosexuality Lee's

1121
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.000
classmates Call Him Sister boy because
like Jim from Rebel Without a Cause he

1122
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.800
refuses to run with the pack Tom prefers
Bach to baseball and the companionship

1123
01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:30.719
of his housemaster's wife Laura to touch
football his male tormentors disregard

1124
01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:35.219
the fact that he is obviously in love
with the Elder woman because he does not

1125
01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:40.199
fit the stereotypical male role in the
Vincent Minnelli film the majority of

1126
01:23:40.199 --> 01:23:44.460
the accusatory remarks about
homosexuality were toned down Thomas

1127
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:48.179
found swimming nude with a teacher who
is also suspected of being gay in the

1128
01:23:48.179 --> 01:23:51.719
play in the film he's labeled queer
because he's discovered stitching a

1129
01:23:51.719 --> 01:23:55.440
button onto his shirt while lounging on
the seashore with a group of Faculty

1130
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.520
spouses the suppressed homosexuality of
Tom's primary Tormentor the masculine

1131
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.420
housemaster played by Leif Erickson who
married Laura to establish his

1132
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:08.580
masculinity is also subdued in the film
adaptation Ericsson disregards Laura in

1133
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:13.320
favor of the young male Macho pupils
that he instructs in Tea and Sympathy a

1134
01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.159
heterosexual youth is falsely accused of
homosexuality by adults whose sporting

1135
01:24:17.159 --> 01:24:21.600
activities provide the most homoerotic
action on screen Tom Blends in well as a

1136
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.140
scapegoat Femme in the well-established
friendships between his classmates

1137
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.360
therefore the film Advocates tolerance
not for sexual deviation but for

1138
01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:34.140
disadvantaged heterosexuals who are less
masculine never is homosexuality

1139
01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.340
considered a viable option for a genuine
man the message is that one cannot

1140
01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:42.360
presume a young man is homosexual solely
on the basis of his football performance

1141
01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.520
when Laura ultimately sleeps with Tom
she is not sparing him from a life of

1142
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.320
sissiness but rather from his own fear
that his classmates may be correct about

1143
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.500
his sexuality a fear that has already
led him to attempt suicide writer Robert

1144
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:03.060
Anderson said to me it was never a play
about homosexuality when Leif Erickson

1145
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:07.800
hounds Tom Lee he's really persecuting
what he fears in himself Tea and

1146
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.120
Sympathy which again was not about
homosexuality nevertheless served as a

1147
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.440
lesson for a generation of gay men who
perceived Tom Lee's tormentors pointed

1148
01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.900
accusations not as timid heterosexuals
but as horrified homosexuals the film

1149
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:26.760
was able to convey a portion of what
actual homosexuals felt and experienced

1150
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.380
in the 1950s while staying faithful to
the cultural imperative of invisibility

1151
01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:35.640
cultural necessity was of course in the
hands of the production code and there

1152
01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.300
was never any thought given to making
the homosexuality in Tian sympathy

1153
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:43.500
moreovert in the film even the prospect
that someone could be gay in reality was

1154
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.159
eliminated prior to the commencement to
filming Deborah Kerr wrote to Vincent

1155
01:25:47.159 --> 01:25:51.780
Minnelli the Breen office is very
difficult about the homosexual angle

1156
01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:58.020
which is I understand their objection
adultery is okay impotence is okay but

1157
01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.820
perversion is their bet Noir in fact
adultery was not okay and so it came

1158
01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.360
under attack from the Catholic Legion of
decency anyway the all already altered

1159
01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.120
ending of Tea and Sympathy had to be
made to reflect the necessary

1160
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.560
retribution for Laura's affair with Tom
thus the finished movie taught that

1161
01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.560
instruction and initiation by an older
woman was a positive thing but that at

1162
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:24.000
the same time such Behavior could not be
condoned at least not for the woman

1163
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.679
Laura gives herself to Tom undoes the
top button of her blouse and says years

1164
01:26:28.679 --> 01:26:35.239
from now
when you talk about this

1165
01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.719
and you will

1166
01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.860
be kind
this is how the stage version concludes

1167
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.800
the fall of the curtain left the
conclusion of the encounter to the

1168
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.600
audience's imagination this however was
not good enough for Hollywood it filmed

1169
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.440
the seduction scene with a subdued
reverence reminiscent of a church

1170
01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.000
service the way the scene was filmed in
the woods with the birds chirping and

1171
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.659
the special lighting made it appear more
like the second coming of Christ than

1172
01:27:03.659 --> 01:27:09.239
the first coming of Tom Lee a glaring
epilogue provides the morally correct

1173
01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:12.960
conclusion that makes the preceding
material acceptable to the Legion of

1174
01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.460
decency at his class reunion 10 years
later Tom wears the largest gold wedding

1175
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:21.719
band ever observed up close on film
Tennessee Williams stepped up to the

1176
01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:27.000
plate to provide what became yet another
comment on the foreign gay twice

1177
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.960
previously Williams's plays were adapted
for the big screen with significant

1178
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.699
homosexual references removed in each
instance the adapters asserted that the

1179
01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:40.800
homosexual aspects of the play were not
needed from a dramatic point of view in

1180
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.840
1951 the pro problem that Blanche Dubois
encountered with her husband was omitted

1181
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.400
from the film adaptation of A Streetcar
Named Desire in 1958 the homosexual

1182
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.840
implications in the relationship between
brick and the deceased Skipper were

1183
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.159
removed from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in
both instances The Producers emphasized

1184
01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:05.460
that homosexuality was not the point and
was readily discarded in favor of more

1185
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:11.639
acceptable explanations then in 1959 two
years before the production code was

1186
01:28:11.639 --> 01:28:15.840
actually revised to permit homosexual
subject matter on screen

1187
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.420
Suddenly Last Summer dealt with the
subject as a psychosexual circus act as

1188
01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.500
the 1950s almost demanded the
homosexuality of Sebastian Venable

1189
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:30.120
Williams's condemned poet could be
inferred but not shown if the brainoff

1190
01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.540
is granted special permission as a
consequence of the combination of

1191
01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:38.760
insanity and cannibalism the film had an
unpleasant sickly Ambiance that made

1192
01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.360
everyone involved approach it with
caution Catherine Hepburn who portrayed

1193
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.040
Violet Venable Sebastian's deranged
mother publicly conveyed her disdain for

1194
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.360
the topic Ken Geist the biographer of
director Joseph mankiewicz claims that

1195
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.639
mankowitz and Spencer Tracy spent the
greater part of an evening in Boston

1196
01:28:55.639 --> 01:29:01.620
explaining homosexuality to Catherine
Hepburn but she flatly refused to

1197
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.940
believe that such people existed she
need not have made such a commotion over

1198
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.900
Suddenly Last Summer though in a meeting
with producer Sam Spiegel and

1199
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:14.940
screenwriter Gore Vidal the Breen office
eliminated all references to homosexual

1200
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:20.699
relationships Gore Vidal said my script
was perfectly explicit

1201
01:29:20.699 --> 01:29:25.620
and then the Catholic Church struck the
Legion of decency after seeing that the

1202
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:30.659
necessary Cuts were made gave the film a
special classification since the film

1203
01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:36.360
illustrates the horrors of such a
lifestyle it can be considered moral in

1204
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.880
theme even though it deals with sexual
perversion it was resolved that

1205
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:47.280
Sebastian Venable would not appear in
person in the film according to Vidal he

1206
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.679
was destined to be a glimmer an occasion
for memory with this decision Hollywood

1207
01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:59.219
had accomplished the unthinkable
it has portrayed an invisible gay man on

1208
01:29:59.219 --> 01:30:03.239
screen in the film Elizabeth Taylor's
character Catherine recounts how she and

1209
01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:07.679
Sebastian spent their days in a Spanish
Hamlet on the seashore and discloses

1210
01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:12.540
that Sebastian used her to seduce young
men Sebastian's efforts were effective

1211
01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:16.560
due to the boy's desperation for cash
however when he began to make

1212
01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.520
preparations for his departure to
Northern Europe Sebastian and Catherine

1213
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:26.219
were accosted by a group of youths
pleading for money on a scorching day

1214
01:30:26.219 --> 01:30:30.600
when Sebastian rebuffed their advances
they pursued him through the city

1215
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.500
streets Sebastian attempted to flee but
the boys followed him wherever he went

1216
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.920
in the meantime Catherine had been
feverishly attempting to catch up to

1217
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.880
Sebastian but when she finally did she
found him surrounded by men

1218
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.920
Catherine claims that they tore
Sebastian apart limb by limb

1219
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:51.179
and ate him Henry Hart a film critic
discussed the origins of Suddenly Last

1220
01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:55.560
Summer in the January 1960 issue of
films in review it is said that

1221
01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:00.300
Tennessee Williams wrote Suddenly Last
Summer when a psychiatrist advised him

1222
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:05.219
that for his own sake not to mention
societies he had better stop denigrating

1223
01:31:05.219 --> 01:31:10.739
normality and begin to expose the evils
of homosexuality and its Allied forms of

1224
01:31:10.739 --> 01:31:14.880
Vice this Williams did
regardless of whether the advice

1225
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.840
actually came from a therapist
Williams's tormented depiction of a

1226
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.460
flailing homosexual artist and the
individuals he victimizes with his

1227
01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.440
aberrant impulses is a classic horror
Tale the creature is finally destroyed

1228
01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.699
by an angry mob of Street Urchins in a
climax similar to that of James Wales

1229
01:31:32.699 --> 01:31:37.440
Frankenstein in which the peasants
pursue the monster to the top of a hill

1230
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.780
where he is consumed by Flames what
emerged from Suddenly Last Summer was a

1231
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:48.360
simple horror film with a budget a film
with a high moral tone that was

1232
01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.980
ultimately unable to investigate its own
subject but even the overt mention of

1233
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:57.239
homosexuality in a film starring
Catherine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor

1234
01:31:57.239 --> 01:32:00.480
shook the foundations on which the
production codes aversion to

1235
01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:04.440
homosexuality stood the erosion of the
power of the production code to maintain

1236
01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.900
specific taboos had begun at the outset
of the 1950s and was only eroding

1237
01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:15.000
Evermore as time went on the California

the homosexual outlook on life in
general and noted that the court opinion

1245
01:32:46.739 --> 01:32:52.920
stated that homosexuality is not to be
endorsed but Society must understand its

1251
01:33:14.699 --> 01:33:18.480
homophobic conclusion after viewing
Scorpio rising in the Village Voice and

1252
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.219
observing that anger Compares a depraved
homosexual orgy to footage from an

critics indicated how the code would
ultimately evolve even in enlightened

1257
01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.000
circles homophobia was far too pervade
and unchallenged for homosexual themed

1258
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.199
films to be evaluated objectively based
solely on their cinematic Merit there

1259
01:33:49.199 --> 01:33:52.920
would be no recognition of the
legitimacy of gay subject matter only a

1260
01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:58.139
condescension to a an intermediate adult
audience Hollywood was determined to

1261
01:33:58.139 --> 01:34:01.739
reach without alienating the old fogies
Spartacus was one of the last commercial

1262
01:34:01.739 --> 01:34:05.340
films to have homosexuality expunged
from its script before the code was

1263
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.900
amended in a scene between crassius and
his adolescent subordinate antoninus who

1264
01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:13.500
did not look like an adolescent the
elder man discreetly establishes his

preference for both men and women do you
eat oysters when I have the master do

1266
01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:23.219
you eat snails
no master do you consider the eating of

1267
01:34:23.219 --> 01:34:27.380
oysters to be modeled and the eating of
snails to be immoral

1268

my taste includes
both snails and oysters this exchange

1269
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.820
was excised from the finished film
immediately followed by antoninus's

1270
01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.560
departure to join Spartacus and the
other slaves in Revolt what is therefore

1271
01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:48.000
lost is any indication of antoninus's
dread of having a homosexual

1272
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.460
relationship with crassius the fear that
causes antoninus to flee at that time so

1273
01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.760
it just kind of comes out of nowhere
such omissions prompted producers and

1274
01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.020
writers in the film industry to lament
that the code restricted their artistic

1275
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:05.820
freedom and prevented Hollywood films
from competing in the mature marketplace

1276
01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:09.960

subject matters openly at the beginning

and his desire to live an authentic
existence as a gay man the film

1333
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:22.139
illustrates how his sexual orientation
could be used against him not only by

1334
01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:27.000
political adversaries but also by those
who sought to exploit his vulnerability

of a hostile broader cultural and

political climate towards the community
as a whole they argue that the Trope

1360

contributed to a culture of dread and
shame surrounding queer identities and

1361

reinforced detrimental stereotypes of
queer individuals as ill immoral and

only heterosexual character Alan can
easily despise the Nelly Emery because

what scares Alan and the audience what

01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:48.000
the possibility that there could be
non-stereotypical homosexuals who are

1393
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.139
also staunch Advocates of a working gay
relationship is presented by the two

1394
01:43:52.139 --> 01:43:56.040
lovers throughout the film
and they are the two characters most

1395
01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.360
often ignored by critics and analysts it
is Larry who speaks of rejecting

1396
01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.580
heterosexual concepts of marriage and
creating a relationship with respect for

1397
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.659
one another's freedoms with no need to
lie or pretend at the end of the film

1398
01:44:09.659 --> 01:44:15.119
Larry and Hank win a telephone Truth
game that Michael has viciously devised

1399
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:19.320
when they call each other and say I love
you

1400
01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.500
it is when Larry and Hank Express
affection for each other physically and

1401
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:26.520
verbally that the audience and the lone
straight party guests are most

1402
01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.420
uncomfortable in contrast Michael's
inability to deal with his own

1403
01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:36.020
homosexuality is exposed as old-time
movie melodrama and Harold's final

1404
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:40.500
equally melodramatic speech puts it into
perspective

1405
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:43.860
you're a homosexual and you don't want
to be

1406
01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:48.060
but there's nothing you can do to change
it

1407
01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:53.820
not all your prayers to your God
not all the analysis you can buy in all

1408
01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.320
the years you've got left to live

1409
01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:02.100
you may very well one day be able to
know a heterosexual life

1410
01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:07.199
if you want it desperately enough
if you pursue it with the fervor with

1411
01:45:07.199 --> 01:45:14.280
which you annihilate
but you'll always be homosexual as well

1412
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.920
always Michael
always the speech encapsulated

1413
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.480
self-hatred and reflected a generation
of gay men who were indoctrinated to

1414
01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.619
blame their problems all on their
homosexuality in the end Michael's

1415
01:45:28.619 --> 01:45:32.940
self-hatred and inability to function
became as archaic as Harold's habit of

1416
01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.880
putting his weed in a Band-Aid box in
the Medicine Chest so that he could

1417
01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:39.420
flush it down the toilet in case the
cops arrived Michael's weeping fits and

1418
01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:43.920
old movie Visions Shone light not on his
homosexuality but on the fallacies and

1419
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.659
illusions of Hollywood dreams dreams
that had taught gay men that they were

1420
01:45:48.659 --> 01:45:54.239
not welcome in polite Society Hollywood
was not moved to change a wit by all of

1421
01:45:54.239 --> 01:45:58.199
this hysteria in gay drawing rooms in
Manhattan though yet boys in the band

1422
01:45:58.199 --> 01:46:02.580
moved gay men throughout the country the
internalized guilt and self-hatred of

1423
01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:07.080
eight gay men at a Manhattan birthday
party formed the best and most potent

1424
01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.960
argument for Gay Liberation ever offered
in popular media it provided actual and

1425
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:16.800
personal instances of the detrimental
repercussions of what gay men learn

1426
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.280
about themselves through media
falsehoods and the film sparked the

1427
01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.139
first public pushback by a budding gay
rights movement against Crowley's plays

1428
01:46:25.139 --> 01:46:29.520
accepted prejudices gay protesters did
not deny the existence of such

1429
01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.020
stereotypes but they were quick to point
out that the Viewpoint was one-sided and

1430
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:38.820
the Prejudice is defined as the sole
depiction or representation of any group

1431
01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:44.400
of people by a minority stereotype the
boys in the band was a movie about gays

1432
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.560
and a gay movie it was a creation born
of a subculture and reflected a harsh

1433
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.300
reflection Society viewed it as if it
were a scientific trip but it was an

1434
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:58.320
interior Journey for many gays who were
shocked by the sadness of Michael's

1435
01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.400
sickening rituals many of Crowley's
caricatures were misconceptions that

1436
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:06.239
gays had accepted and even fit
themselves into since there seemed to be

1437
01:47:06.239 --> 01:47:09.780
no other option the audience for boys in
the band included gay people who had

1438
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:13.440
grown up thinking that they were the
only gays in the world the film explored

1439
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.600
passing and not being able to pass
loving and not being able to love and

1440
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.860
above all else surviving in a world that
denied one's very existence but it did

1441
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:26.780
so before an American public that was at
the stage of

1442
01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.800
barely being able to mention
homosexuality at all within a few years

1443
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.600
of boys in the band there was summer
wishes Winter Dreams in which Joanne

1444
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.980
Woodward's Sons homosexuality is solely
perceived in terms of how it impacts her

1445
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:45.179
current midlife crisis as yet another
sign of her failure as a wife and mother

1446
01:47:45.179 --> 01:47:50.040
she eventually comes to terms with it
but her son leaves for Amsterdam with a

1447
01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:55.320
friend and refuses to visit his parents
until they can live with him as he truly

1448
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.639
is he makes their reluctance to
recognize him as a full person their

1449
01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:03.360
problem
a family affair rather than his a very

1450
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.900
natural thing the first film with
homosexual Liberation themes designed

1451
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:11.880
for commercial distribution was then
released in 1973. the film investigated

1452
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:15.780
the possibilities available to gay
couples on society's terms and raised

1453
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.760
the questions how do two guys who refuse
to play society's game Define a

1454
01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:24.300
non-roll-based relationship while the
film was inspired by the Gay Liberation

1455
01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.440
movement it was dismissed as a trivial
soap opera by The Establishment press

1456
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:33.239
and Savaged by gay liberationists for
its romantic Illusions and lack of

radical conviction David an

relationship with Mark a straight

film the first part of the movie

split the relationship is a protracted

1461
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.920

they go to the Opera roll in the fall

shave in the morning and imitate every

1463
01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.040
heterosexual movie cliche about love and
marriage the connection ends due to

1464

unsatisfactory to him as his persistent

loneliness David meets Jason a divorce

1468

alter his Notions about the nature of
homosexual relationships Freedom From

1469
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.440
The Assumption of roles in an
unstructured relationship is difficult

1470
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.880
to depict on film in a poetic style
without inviting skepticism but the

1471
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.080
filmmakers were aware of this and
purposefully opted to regard romance as

1472
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.860
the bottom line as a result of the
filmmakers couching his message in such

1473
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.820
endlessly romantic terms the picture
enraged the same people fighting for

1474
01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.420
such a political redefinition a very
natural thing had such significant

1475
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.219
promotion and distribution issues that
it had little influence however it is

1476
01:49:50.219 --> 01:49:54.360
still viewed as a breakthrough film in
queer Cinema Theory classes the New York

1477
01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.040
Post described it as an argument rather
than entertainment while Judith Christ

1478
01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.600
said if the Gay Liberation movement
wants its own mediocre movie

1479
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:08.639
here it is elsewhere in cinemas John
Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was a

1480
01:50:08.639 --> 01:50:13.679
poignant understanding and interesting
story that has consistently been cited

1481
01:50:13.679 --> 01:50:18.420
since as an example of a good gay film
that failed to make it at the box office

1482
01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.560
proof that homosexuality is not a
money-making proposition in movie terms

1483
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.760
the problem however was in the packaging
Sunday Bloody Sunday was a talky

1484
01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.659
introspective British production that
wasn't intended for a wide audience in

1485
01:50:30.659 --> 01:50:35.580
the United States it was noted in the
1980s that there appears to be very

1486
01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:39.480
little room in the American Market
anymore for the small but interesting

1487
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:44.340
film according to producers and writers
this is now the specialty of Television

1488
01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:48.960
films interesting how history repeats
itself as small and interesting now

1489
01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.340
seems to be the Forte of streaming
services this film Schlesinger said is

1490
01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.000
not about the sexuality of these people
these movies never seem to be about the

1491
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.300
sexuality of the people in them these
people were a gay doctor a straight

1492
01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:03.900
career lady and a bisexual artist with
whom they were both in love Sunday

1493
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:08.520
Bloody Sunday was not about sexuality as
Schlesinger correctly said however it

1494
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.639
was a film in which alternative
sexuality was taken for granted

1495
01:51:11.639 --> 01:51:15.540
something that gay activists had long
sought it was a film on human

1496
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:19.320
relationships and how they do not always
correspond to our expectations of what

1497
01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.920
love should be the film portrayed a
joyful ending for a gay character whose

1498
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.300
boring resignation is not the result of
his homosexuality in his final monologue

1499
01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:32.880
he informs the audience they say
it never made you happy and I said but I

1500
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.080
am happy
apart from missing him all my life I've

1501
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:42.619
been looking for somebody courageous
resourceful

1502
01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:45.800
he's not it

1503
01:51:46.199 --> 01:51:48.980
but something

1504
01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:54.060
we were something
but America despised Sunday Bloody

1505
01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:58.260
Sunday one kiss between the men created
even more controversy than scenes of

1506
01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:01.739
them in bed together male male
relationships were characterized by

1507
01:52:01.739 --> 01:52:07.619
nothing but sex yet genuine love between
men was frowned upon in most eyes and it

1508
01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:10.260
was the first time on screen when a
loving kiss between two men was not

1509
01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:15.420
intended to shock or repulse in American
Cinema it drew gasps from Spectators and

1510
01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:19.920
as a result several theaters refused to
book the film at all however it provided

1511
01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:23.520
gay moviegoers with a mostly positive
experience even if they were the only

1512
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.199
people in the theater aside from the
more serious gay films gays were popping

1513
01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:32.159
up in small roles all over Hollywood
mostly As comedic foils perhaps most

1514
01:52:32.159 --> 01:52:36.719
famously in Mel Brooks's The Producers
but all of this laughter was lost on the

1515
01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:41.400
national gay task force which issued a
set of guidelines for Studios to follow

1516
01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.440
including homosexuality isn't funny use
the same rules you have for other

1517
01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:51.540
minorities if bigots don't get away with
it if they hate Catholics they they

1518
01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:56.639
can't get away with it if they hate gays
stereotypical people do exist but if

1519
01:52:56.639 --> 01:53:01.020
such a minority of any group receives
exclusive media exposure

1520
01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:05.639
that is bigotry hmm
television which is subject to the

1521
01:53:05.639 --> 01:53:09.480
regulation of the FCC and to the
reaction of its advertisers to vocal

1522
01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.860
public opinion was more vulnerable to
this type of activist pressure than was

1523
01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:17.699
the motion picture industry television
programming which aired nearly 24 hours

1524
01:53:17.699 --> 01:53:21.679
a day was always in need of societal
concerns to address

1525
01:53:21.679 --> 01:53:25.980
homosexuality being one of them a film
must be a success but if a television

1526
01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:30.540
show fails there is always next week and
another subject to try therefore

1527
01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:34.199
experimentation was encouraged pressure
from Gay Liberation influenced

1528
01:53:34.199 --> 01:53:37.500
television's approach to portraying
homosexuality for the American audience

1529
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:42.659
and it was successful in achieving a
more balanced and surely more prolific

1530
01:53:42.659 --> 01:53:46.800
discourse on television than in film
Archie Bunker Norman lear's Charming

1531
01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.719
bigot first encountered homosexuality in
1972 when he realized that one of his

1532
01:53:51.719 --> 01:53:56.280
drinking buddies a former football star
was gay

1533
01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.480
how long you know me
10 12 years yeah

1534
01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.020
in all that time did I ever mention a
woman

1535
01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:07.400
but what difference does that make you a
bachelor so

1536
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:14.400
I know but pastors there they're always
acting kind of private exactly

1537
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.159
oh come on
watching from the White House President

1538
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:26.580
Nixon declared it distasteful
because it made a good man look like a

1539
01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:31.260
fool it is unclear if Nixon was talking
about Archie Bunker or the football

1540
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:35.460
player that same year ABC made a
significant step forward in the

1541
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:39.360
portrayal of ordinary gay men on
television that certain summer a

1542
01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.679
two-hour movie of the week presented the
story of a divorced dad who chooses to

1543
01:54:43.679 --> 01:54:47.699
tell his 14 year old son that he is gay
when his son arrives for a weekend visit

1544
01:54:47.699 --> 01:54:51.659
when the father eventually gets around
to describing the issue to his son the

1545
01:54:51.659 --> 01:54:56.400
boy rushes away unable to deal with it
for gay liberationists The Narrative was

1546
01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.600
a little too soft while it earned
glowing reviews in the mainstream press

1547
01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.100
several gay writers criticize it for
being too hesitant and unduly cautious

1548
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:10.320
but with the critical success of that
certain summer the barriers seemed to

1549
01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.119
come crashing down for television by the
mid-1970s queer characters had appeared

1550
01:55:15.119 --> 01:55:19.920
on virtually every sitcom drama and talk
show in prime time TV All in the Family

1551
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.060
Rhoda mod Barney Miller Mash The Bob
Newhart Show and scores of others

1552
01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:27.960
featured gay characters the naked civil
servant and the war Widow two

1553
01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.980
spectacular television dramas were
uplifting depictions of the lives of

1554
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:36.900
lgbtq people both real and fictitious
both series instilled in its key

1555
01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:41.219
characters a sense of history and their
position as strugglers for sexual

1556
01:55:41.219 --> 01:55:45.119
Freedom both shows revealed a hidden
aspect of the gay experience through

1557
01:55:45.119 --> 01:55:48.780
romance and humor although Quinton
crisp's story in the naked civil servant

1558
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:53.940
was not a gay liberationist's Dream by
any means gay is greatly admired and

1559
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.920
respected crisp's defiant lifestyle when

1568
01:56:39.719 --> 01:56:44.280
Heroes emerged on the movie screen at
least not until the release of Dog Day

1569
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.600
Afternoon the film directed by Sydney
lament and starring Al Pacino is a

1570
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.500
complex and nuanced exploration of the
queer experience set during a bank

1571
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:57.000
robbery gone awry in Brooklyn the film
tells the story of Sunny a man who Robs

1572
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.960
a Bank in order to pay for Leon's
Sunny's Partners gender confirmation

1573
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.580
surgery Leon isn't given a feminine name
in the movie FYI as the story unfolds we

1574
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:09.300
learn more about sunny and Leon's
relationship we discover that Leon is a

1575
01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:13.199
pre-op trans woman and sunny is willing
to do whatever it takes to support her

1576
01:57:13.199 --> 01:57:17.520
including robbing a bank to fund the
procedure this is a powerful statement

1577
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.900
about the lengths that queer people will
go to in order to support and care for

1578
01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.000
one another especially in a society that
is often hostile and unwelcoming the

1579
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.699
film also explores the impact of queer
identity on the character's

1580
01:57:29.699 --> 01:57:32.699
relationships with their families when
Sonny's mother comes to the bank to try

1581
01:57:32.699 --> 01:57:35.880
and talk him out of the robbery he
reveals to her that Leon is a trans

1582
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.560
woman
her reaction is one of shock and disgust

1583
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.340
another important queer theme in Dog Day
Afternoon is the way that Sunny

1584
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.940
sexuality and gender identity intersect
with his working class background

1585
01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:51.179
throughout the film we see Sunny
interacting with other members of his

1586
01:57:51.179 --> 01:57:54.960
community including his friends and the
police officers who are trying to

1587
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.380
negotiate with him his working class
background is an important part of his

1588
01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:02.760
identity and it's clear that he feels a
sense of loyalty and connection to his

1589
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.300
community something not often seen among
queer characters who were usually

1590
01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:11.520
artists or working in fields of high
esteem like universities made for a

1591
01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:16.199
budget of 3.5 million dollars it went on
to gross 56 million dollars at the box

1592
01:58:16.199 --> 01:58:21.360
office or 381 million dollars when
adjusted for inflation and was nominated

1593
01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.219
for six Oscars including best picture
bursting the bubble of the assumption

1594
01:58:26.219 --> 01:58:30.840
that movies with queer characters and
themes can't succeed but Al Pacino

1595
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:36.119
returned to gay Cinema five years later
with cruising which

1596
01:58:36.119 --> 01:58:40.139
did not go over so well cruising was
based on a 1970 novel by the New York

1597
01:58:40.139 --> 01:58:43.560
Times editor Gerald Walker that
portrayed the process by which a New

1598
01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:47.520
York city policeman assigned to capture
a psychotic killer of gay men becomes

1599
01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.780
aware of his own homosexuality and then
commences killing gay men the gay

1600
01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:54.960
characters in the novel are all filled
with self-hatred and hatred for the

1601
01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.560
people who turned them gay the blame
usually falls on the first man with whom

1602
01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:02.639
they had sex the killer Intimates that
the homosexual lifestyle is an

1603
01:59:02.639 --> 01:59:07.320
inherently violent one the killer in the
film adaptation knifes his victims to

1604
01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:12.179
death during or immediately following
sex and the film opens with a shot of a

1605
01:59:12.179 --> 01:59:17.040
gangrenous severed arm floating in the
Hudson River Al Pacino's character a cop

1606
01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:21.960
immerses himself in the underground of
heavy leather and sadomasochism as the

1607
01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.760
film goes on he becomes agitated and
Restless a state brought about by his

1608
01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.960
own sexual identity crisis though his
motives are never explored or explained

1609
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:35.340
when he finally locates the killer he
stabs him which puts the killer in the

1610
01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:38.940
hospital under police custody Pacino's
assignment is over

1611
01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:42.179
however
another murder follows

1612
01:59:42.179 --> 01:59:47.340
this time that of Pacino's gay next door
neighbor who was the only relatively

1613
01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:51.060
happy gay character in the movie it is
implied in the end that Pacino himself

1614
01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:55.380
had committed this final murder and the
film ends with him gazing at himself in

1615
01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:59.639
a mirror in a statement to the press the
director screenwriter William friedkin

1616
01:59:59.639 --> 02:00:05.099
of boys in the band said that he was not
sure who the real murderer was and that

1617
02:00:05.099 --> 02:00:09.000
furthermore he did not consider the
murderer to be homosexual a more likely

1618
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.159
conclusion is that friedkin deliberately
obscured the identity of the killer

1619
02:00:14.159 --> 02:00:19.380
either consciously or unconsciously as a
response so the wave of protests that

1620
02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:24.179
arose in the summer of 1979 when he
began filming gays who protested the

1621
02:00:24.179 --> 02:00:27.780
making of the film maintained that it
would show that when Pacino recognized

1622
02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:31.560
his attraction to the homosexual world
he would become psychotic and begin to

1623
02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:35.520
kill so freedkin avoided that situation
by leaving the ending of the film

1624
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:40.020
relatively ambiguous yet friedkin
realized that his film said what gay

1625
02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:44.159
activists claimed it said and he had a
disclaimer to all Prince of the film

1626
02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:49.800
this film is not intended as an
indictment of the homosexual world

1627
02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:54.360
it is set in one small segment of that
world which is not meant to be

1628
02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.199
representative of the whole gay
audiences around this time began to see

1629
02:00:58.199 --> 02:01:02.460
that Hollywood was willing to overlook
successful queer films but would admire

1630
02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:07.020
themselves in their failures the most
insightful and important films were

1631
02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:12.239
those which had been made in struggle by
small groups of people and against

1632
02:01:12.239 --> 02:01:16.679
tremendous odds the producers and
directors of the British film Nighthawks

1633
02:01:16.679 --> 02:01:21.540
spent five years preparing and Gathering
funds for their film about a gay teacher

1634
02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:25.440
who spends his nights cruising in bars
and discos and having one-night stands

1635
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.820
Nighthawks offers an almost documentary
style look into the evening cityscape of

1636
02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:33.780
the ritualistic life of a man who is
becoming aware that he lives two lives

1637
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:38.280
the dispassionate view of London gay
nightlife allows a gay male audience to

1638
02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:43.920
experience the hunt as more than a
passive spectator there is an uncanny

1639
02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:49.380
feeling that each member of the audience
is himself cruising recognizing a look a

1640
02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:53.280
gesture a glance then realizing it is
meant for the character in the film

1641
02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.480
through whose eyes we are looking no
slick and Sensational Hollywood Peep

1642
02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.520
Show Nighthawks is a perceptive film
with modest intentions and it succeeded

1643
02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:05.940
without compromising its scope for
commercial reasons while William

1644
02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:10.139
friedkin was on New York streets filming
the blood and guts Hollywood version of

1645
02:02:10.139 --> 02:02:14.760
the gay underground Nighthawks opened in
New York and got what turned out to be

1646
02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.719
better reviews than cruising would get
six months later and some queer

1647
02:02:18.719 --> 02:02:23.760
filmmakers were willing not just a step
outside of the Hollywood System

1648
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.440
but all over it John Waters became
synonymous with the queer underground

1649
02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:32.400
Cinema movement of the 1970s thanks to
his outrageous and subversive style

1650
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.300
Waters films are known for their
irreverent humor over the top characters

1651
02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:40.440
and outrageous subject matter he has
always been drawn to the marginalized

1652
02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.460
and the taboo and his films often
explore themes of sexuality gender and

1653
02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:49.080
identity many of his films feature queer
characters and he has been credited with

1654
02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:52.699
helping to break down barriers and
challenge stereotypes about queer people

1655
02:02:52.699 --> 02:02:57.960
especially the messy ones and we love a
messy queer waters's film female trouble

1656
02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:03.000
released in 1974 is a classic example of
his queer Cinema the film follows the

1657
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.440
story of Don Davenport played by the
Divine Divine who is a rebellious

1658
02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:10.920
teenager with a troubled home life she
runs away from home and becomes involved

1659
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:15.060
in a series of crimes ultimately leading
to her downfall the film features a cast

1660
02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:19.080
of characters that includes drag queens
sex workers and other Outsiders who

1661
02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.219
challenge societal Norms of gender and
sexuality another notable film in waters

1662
02:03:23.219 --> 02:03:26.699
Canon is desperate living the film takes
place in a fictional town called

1663
02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:30.780
mortville where the residents are all
social outcasts and deviants the film

1664
02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:34.260
features a cast of characters that
includes a lesbian couple a transgender

1665
02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:38.119
woman and a group of militant feminists
the film is a

1666
02:03:38.119 --> 02:03:44.580
dark comedy that explores themes of
power privilege and oppression and most

1667
02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.360
iconically
there's Pink Flamingos the queerness of

1668
02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.480
this film is evident in the way it
portrays its characters and its themes

1669
02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:55.560
and it remains a potent example of the
power of queer Cinema to disrupt and

1670
02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:59.340
subvert
all expectations Gentlemen of the press

1671
02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:05.040
get ready cause you are about to witness
the biggest news event of the year live

1672
02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.179
homicide one of the most striking
aspects of Pink Flamingos is the way it

1673
02:04:09.179 --> 02:04:13.440
portrays its Central character Divine is
a larger than life figure both in terms

1674
02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.360
of her physical appearance and her
personality she is a force of nature

1675
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.360
unapologetically embracing her own
queerness and challenging anyone who

1676
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.739
tries to limit or control her her
sexuality is fluid and she engages in

1677
02:04:25.739 --> 02:04:29.639
relationships with both men and women
throughout the film in addition to its

1678
02:04:29.639 --> 02:04:33.060
portrayal of queer characters Pink
Flamingos also explores themes that are

1679
02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:37.139
Central to the queer experience the
film's focus on Outsiders and those who

1680
02:04:37.139 --> 02:04:41.219
are marginalized by mainstream Society
is a recurring theme throughout with

1681
02:04:41.219 --> 02:04:45.179
characters like Divine and her cohorts
living on the fringes of society and

1682
02:04:45.179 --> 02:04:49.679
rejecting traditional norms
at the same time Pink Flamingos is also

1683
02:04:49.679 --> 02:04:53.280
a celebration of queer culture and a
testament to the power of queer

1684
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:57.900
resilience despite the violence and
degradation they face Divine and her

1685
02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:02.820
cohorts remain defiant refusing to be
cowed by the oppressive forces of

1686
02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:07.560
society their queerness is a source of
strength and a way of connecting with

1687
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:12.060
others who share their experiences
creating a sense of community and

1688
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:17.280
belonging in the face of adversity
content warning though Waters films are

1689
02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.599
also notable for their celebration of
Camp a style that Embraces theatricality

1690
02:05:21.599 --> 02:05:25.139
and excess water's influence on the
world of film and popular culture is

1691
02:05:25.139 --> 02:05:29.820
undeniable he has inspired countless
artists and filmmakers and his work has

1692
02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:33.599
been celebrated for its subversive and
irreverent humor his films have also

1693
02:05:33.599 --> 02:05:37.260
helped to pave the way for a greater
representation of queer characters and

1694
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:41.040
stories in mainstream media by
challenging societal norms and pushing

1695
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.900
boundaries Waters has left an indelible
mark on the world of Cinema and Beyond

1696
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:50.400
these queer under underground films
opened the minds of many who wanted

1697
