1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
it could be said that I'm a bit of a
Harry Potter fan I jumped onto the

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.069
series when I was 12 just after coming
out yes I came out that young which was

3
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.240
also just after the release of Goblet of
Fire I devoured the first four books

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
between September and November of 2001
just in time for Harry Potter and the

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
Philosopher's Stone to hit theaters
since then I've watched every movie too

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.240
many times to count
and I reread the entire series at least

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
once a year it's a bit of a tradition
for me at this point I also have the

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
audiobooks read by Stephen Fry and
listen to them every night as I go to

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
sleep
they're like ASMR for me so maybe I'm

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
more than just a bit of a Harry Potter
fan it eats at me every day that I

11
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.590
haven't gotten to go to the Wizarding
World of Harry Potter at Universal

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.789
Studios yet someday so growing up gay
during the years at the Bush

13
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.350
administration JK Rowling's books were a
bit of a respite for me a place I could

14
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.670
return to when the real world bigots
became too much to handle it was a place

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
where wizards of all races and
backgrounds intermingled in the same

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.619
school and were the characters who hate
muggles were obviously the villains

17
00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
there was no looking at it from both
sides arguments in Harry Potter like

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.850
there was on CNN Baltimore hated muggles
and mud Bloods and he was the bad guy

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.439
Republicans hated gay people but that
was their quote religious freedom so it

20
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.680
was a bit of a shock to me when I
started seeing people online call out JK

21
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
Rowling for being homophobic or at the
very least being supportive of gay

22
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.270
erasure the controversy over
Dumbledore's gayness and whether or not

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.079
it would exist in the new Fantastic
beast films was getting some people a

24
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.970
little tilted the fervor is died down
for the moment but I'm sure it'll be

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.329
back up in full swing by the time the
release of fantastic beasts the crimes

26
00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.670
of Grindelwald comes around in November
so I decided to take this time to look

27
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.649
at the world that JK Rowling created the
characters that inhabit it and see what

28
00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.770
gayness I could gleam from it to answer
the question of why was I a newly out

29
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
gay kid so completely obsessed with
Harry Potter when there was an area gay

30
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.880
character to be seen
what did I find so appealing about the

31
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.670
Boy Who Lived besides that

32
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:30.199
[Music]

33
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.600
Harry Potter in the Philosopher's Stone
was first published in June of 1997 and

34
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.860
begun the story of Harry Potter a child
wizard who was orphaned when his parents

35
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.000
James and Lily were murdered by Lord
Voldemort Harry is sent to live with his

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
muggle hot and uncle on his mother's
side the Dursleys the Dursleys are

37
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.630
completely aware of Harry's Wizarding
lineage and here is where the comparison

38
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.790
to growing up gay begins many times gay
children are completely unaware that

39
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.290
they're gay they don't feel attraction
to people of the same sex yet and even

40
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.110
though they may have characteristics
that don't perfectly align with the

41
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.060
gender norms girls that are tom boys and
boys that are [ __ ] boys they don't feel

42
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.530
any different from anyone else most of
the time but sometimes the adults in

43
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.130
their lives pick up on these
characteristics especially with little

44
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.060
boys a boy who likes playing with dolls
prefers disney princesses to

45
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.970
transformers or likes to wear the color
pink might be made fun of by his peers

46
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.530
even by adults his own family might
punish him for liking these things not

47
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.709
allowing him to play with girls refusing
to buy him toys or clothing that could

48
00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.700
in any way be construed as feminine the
child is made to feel ashamed of what

49
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.230
they like the adults in their life are
shaming them for being who they are

50
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:09.810
which it was I was the only one to see
her for what she was and then she had

51
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.319
you when I knew he would be the same
just

52
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.039
strange justice abnormal they know that
Harry is likely a wizard

53
00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.090
especially when odd happenings begin to
take place in his early childhood things

54
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.820
that the Dursleys immediately spot as
magic

55
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.560
even when Harry's a baby to put a stop
to it they lied to him about his family

56
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.310
telling him that his parents had died in
a car crash and that the lightning bolts

57
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.620
scar on his head was also a result of
said crash they wouldn't allow him to

58
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.970
see pictures of his parents and even hid
his existence from others by having him

59
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.449
live in a cupboard under the stairs
stashing him there or whenever they had

60
00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.009
company it's not a far stretch to see
Harry's near imprisonment in the

61
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.110
cupboard as being trapped in a closet
the Dursleys also made sure to have no

62
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.669
pictures of Harry around the house he
was made to feel shame by the Dursleys

63
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.039
and everyone in their orbit for
something he didn't understand something

64
00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.949
he didn't even know he was this happens
a lot - gage hildren especially in

65
00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.820
particularly religious families pray
away the gay cams regularly have

66
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.820
prepubescent children admitted by
parents who think they might possibly

67
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.360
maybe could be gay need to put a stop to
it before they realize it for themselves

68
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.840
create the shame that will if not
actually cure it it doesn't at least

69
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.520
stop the child from eventually acting on
their urges and so Vernon and petunia

70
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.000
Dursley did everything they could to
keep Harry ignorant of his true heritage

71
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.740
to make sure he stayed in the closet so
this week they took particularly drastic

72
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.070
action when Harry begun receiving
invitations to join other people like

73
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.490
him
the Dursleys especially Vernon who had a

74
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.470
particular hatred of anything not quote
normal wouldn't let Harry even leave the

75
00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.050
house eventually they stowed Harry away
on a rock in the sea quite literally in

76
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.099
the middle of nowhere but try as they
might Harry could not be kept in the

77
00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.110
closet with the help of Rubeus Hagrid
Harry was ushered into the Wizarding

78
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.580
World how did he enter the Wizarding
World well the same way a lot of gay

79
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.169
people enter the gay world for the first
time via a bar a bar that on the outside

80
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.090
seems nondescript enough but the inside
is populated by people the outside world

81
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.580
would not accept
remember Harry Potter and the

82
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.820
Philosopher's Stone was written in the
early 90s at the height of the AIDS

83
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.000
crisis being gay was still very behind
the counter and a nondescript paper bag

84
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.460
secret quiet something you didn't
necessarily broadcast to the world many

85
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.080
gay men and women at the time never met
another gay person until they went to a

86
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.790
gay bar and that's what Harry Potter
does he enters the leaky cauldron and is

87
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.530
exposed to a magical world he had no
idea existed not to mention he joins

88
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.610
this world by being brought into the
back room with a big hairy guy but we

89
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.840
won't talk about that when harry enters
the magical world he meets any number of

90
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.169
new people who are just like him
people his own age who he learns things

91
00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.150
alongside of people younger than him who
would idolize him and eccentric older

92
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.860
mentor figures that look out for him a
lot like the gay community of the early

93
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.410
90s there was no protection for sexual
orientation in England until 2003 so at

94
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.590
the time of Harry Potter's writing you
still had to keep your gayness hidden

95
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.520
for the most part unless you wanted to
run the risk of being outed and possibly

96
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.919
losing your job your family your friends
everything and so gay men and women

97
00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.850
created their own social networks their
own support networks to help each other

98
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.760
through the tough times separated from
the quote normal world or as Rowling

99
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.020
would put at the muggle world in the
1980s the Thatcher government was almost

100
00:07:49.020 --> 00:08:02.940
as hesitant as the Reagan government to
acknowledge the AIDS epidemic as people

101
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.870
drop dead from this blood-borne plague
Thatcher and Reagan went about their

102
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.220
lives business as usual much like how
the Ministry of Magic refused to

103
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.160
acknowledge the return of Voldemort
until they simply could not turn a blind

104
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.910
eye anymore it's bad and much like in
the real world it was too late the

105
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.200
damage had been done people were dead
and more were dying every day both

106
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.400
wizards and muggles alike fell at the
hand of Voldemort gay people and stray

107
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.880
people both died from a disease that
could have possibly been slowed down if

108
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.659
not stopped
if only the government had cared enough

109
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:41.159
there actually is a direct allegory for
aids in the Harry Potter books and that

110
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.779
is lycanthropy or being a werewolf a
condition thrust upon Remus Lupin at a

111
00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:50.629
young age when he was attacked by Fenrir
Greyback non too subtle rape allegory

112
00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:54.149
Remus was terrified to disclose his
condition to his friends and did

113
00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:58.529
everything he could to hide it from them
much like many gay men in the 1980s who

114
00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:04.290
were diagnosed with HIV Rowling herself
confirmed the allegorical meaning of

115
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.089
lycanthropy in her ebook short stories
from Hogwarts of heroism hardship and

116
00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:14.579
dangerous hobbies released in 2016
not everything gay related in Harry

117
00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:18.629
Potter is allegory though some things
are actually written in the text

118
00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:22.019
themselves such as the relationship
between Dumbledore and Gellert

119
00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:26.310
Grindelwald the story of the two men is
told in pieces in Harry Potter and the

120
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.509
Deathly Hollows after Dumbledore's death
in the sixth novel a salacious

121
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:35.910
in-universe biography of Dumbledore is
published the life and lies of Albus

122
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.500
Dumbledore by Rita Skeeter in this book
it is revealed that Dumbledore had a

123
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.850
very close relationship with Gellert
Grindelwald who would go on to become

124
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.589
the equivalent of wizard Hitler in the
book this is the biggest controversy

125
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.519
which turns out to be pretty accurate
right down to Dumbledore refusing to

126
00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.939
stop his old friend even as he murdered
his way across Europe during the years

127
00:09:56.939 --> 00:10:00.449
of world war ii though the two did
eventually faceoff with Dumbledore

128
00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:04.199
winning in Grindelwald being locked away
until his death at the hands of Valda

129
00:10:04.199 --> 00:10:08.430
Mort in 1998 but the real controversy
sprung up in the real world when JK

130
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.870
Rowling was asked if Albus Dumbledore
had ever known true love Rowling stated

131
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.759
that Dumbledore was in fact gay and over
time went into some detail in regard to

132
00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.380
his love for Grindelwald as a young man
a love and infatuation that lasted well

133
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.600
into adulthood she has said that the
feelings were not entirely mutual and

134
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.920
the Grindelwald may have been using
Dumbledore's love for him to control the

135
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.309
young wizard other theories say that the
feelings were mutual

136
00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:40.230
but the Grindelwald lust for power was
greater than his love for Dumbledore the

137
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.769
pair split after the death of
Dumbledore's younger sister Ariana a

138
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:47.490
death that Dumbledore blamed himself for
this trauma on top

139
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.059
being so tragically betrayed by
Grindelwald led to Dumbledore becoming

140
00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:57.660
as Rowling put it quite asexual between
1945 and his death in 1997 Dumbledore

141
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.899
did not take any lovers as far as we
know so though he is confirmed to be gay

142
00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:08.610
he may have only ever actually loved one
man many straight fans felt betrayed

143
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.290
that the Dumbledore they grew up with
thinking was straight was suddenly gay

144
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:18.839
ah you have inserted politics into my
children's novel and many gay fans felt

145
00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:21.720
betrayed the Dumbledore sexuality was
never actually stated outright in the

146
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.490
books the betrayal of gay fans was
compounded when Dumbledore was announced

147
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.839
to be a leading character in the new
series of fantastic beasts movies but

148
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:34.980
director David Yates stated that they
will not explicitly mention Dumbledore

149
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.929
sexuality in the second film the crimes
of Grindelwald some fans took this to

150
00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:44.309
mean it would never be addressed in the
five film series others like myself are

151
00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:48.329
willing to give it a bit more breathing
room especially since there was already

152
00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:52.829
a lot of homoeroticism in the first
fantastic peace movie in fantastic

153
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:55.589
beasts and where to find them
Grindelwald has taken on the guise of

154
00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:59.399
Percival graves and infiltrated the
makuu's ax or the magical Congress of

155
00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:03.689
the United States of America to hunt
down an obscure e 'l an extremely

156
00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:07.439
powerful young wizard whose magic is
literally exploding out of them due to

157
00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:12.869
it being suppressed he recruits credence
played by out actor Azra miller to help

158
00:12:12.869 --> 00:12:18.360
him track it down their relationship is
more than just a little close do you

159
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.810
think I'm a freak
No

160
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.900
I think you're a very special young man
or I wouldn't have asked you to help me

161
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:31.610
now would I
I want you to have this credence I would

162
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:39.250
trust very few with it very soon

163
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:48.720
with you you different watching it it's
quite easy to see the Grindelwald is

164
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.890
doing exactly the Creedence what he did
to Dumbledore decades before creating an

165
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.570
emotional connection with the fragile
young man using him and then dropping

166
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.950
him as soon as he appears to no longer
be useful as it turns out Creedence

167
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:08.190
himself was the obscure and in the end
of the film Grindelwald is so distraught

168
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.320
at his apparent demise at the hands of
the Makua

169
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.040
that he begins to lose control of his
disguise eventually being discovered and

170
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.890
arrested the relationship between
credence and Grindelwald isn't exactly

171
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.820
subtle in the film you'd have to try
pretty hard to ignore the homosexual

172
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.959
undertones between the two characters I
read this as Rowling who wrote the

173
00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:32.880
screenplay laying the groundwork for
more overt homosexual themes in later

174
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.170
films ensuring that the audience would
allow her to tell the story of

175
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.250
Grindelwald and Dumbledore properly
without straight washing it that's how I

176
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.220
read it
but maybe I'm being optimistic we'll see

177
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.339
this November when the crimes of
Grindelwald is released and finally

178
00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:51.510
there's the issue of Harry Potter and
the cursed child and the gay love affair

179
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:57.240
between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy
that never was but I think that's a

180
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.600
whole other video so what do you think
about the gay themes in the Harry Potter

181
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.290
universe do you think Rowling Yates and
Warner Brothers will actually show

182
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.730
Dumbledore's gayness in the upcoming
movies or will he be straight washed let
