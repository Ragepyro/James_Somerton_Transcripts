00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
hello everyone and welcome to episode 18
of the padreon it's just me again

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
um I think there's gonna be this one and
another episode and then we'll have some

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
episodes with Nick again I think I might
be wrong

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
I might be completely wrong who knows
um also very sorry for getting this

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.699
episode out so late I try to get the
padreons out every Tuesday uh which I

6
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.399
have failed at miserably in most cases
um

7
00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.360
but
this week I thought that I was getting

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.059
better I had been sick for a while I
thought I was getting better and then I

9
00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.840
hit a wall again which was just lovely
um

10
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.399
but uh I did a stream last night so I'm
recording this on Thursday at a stream

11
00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.860
on Wednesday where I started to get sick
again and I am not feeling the best

12
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.260
right now but I'm like I can't
continue to put off the recording so

13
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.979
um
I took some Tylenol and I took some

14
00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.260
DayQuil and we'll see how long I last
so um

15
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.820
the concept behind this episode of the
padreon also I'm using a new microphone

16
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.540
it's a very expensive fancy microphone
that I got specifically for streaming

17
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.700
but I'm using it for the padreon as well
um at least on my end when when Nick

18
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.900
gets back we'll be using the normal
microphones but um

19
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.579
[Music]
um

20
00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.100
yeah so hopefully it uh it sounds good
uh but yeah the so the Crux of this

21
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.200
episode of the padreon is I put out a
message to everyone who is a patron uh

22
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.479
sort of asking you guys if there are any
questions that you would really like

23
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.340
answered kind of No Holds Barred and
anything that you would like me to

24
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
answer
in kind of a long-winded way like a very

25
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.280
detailed answer something that if we
were doing an AMA

26
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.360
um that was just a stream
you know I'd be kind of trying to get

27
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.739
through questions uh because there's
usually like 50 questions something like

28
00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.520
that and so I'm usually trying to get
through them and not being able to give

29
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.800
like really detailed answers and I've
looked at some of the questions that

30
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
came in and unfortunately for some of
them I'm not going to be able to give uh

31
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.959
detailed answers just because I'm
not as knowledgeable about things as I

32
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.420
should be maybe
um

33
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.099
but yeah so let's start I won't
um

34
00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.239
uh say like which who asked which
question

35
00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.800
um it's not a
uh you know

36
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.500
keeping people private thing it's uh I'm
gonna run into names I can't pronounce

37
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.239
and I don't want to look dumb so that's
why

38
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.000
uh so I'm just gonna go in order of uh
who asked the questions first so first

39
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.400
question is what sort of movies shows
and other media would you recommend to a

40
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.420
mid-20s by man who hasn't really gotten
the chance to experience much queer

41
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.459
media due to a sheltered upbringing sort
of a required viewing list or your top

42
00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.560
picks
um

43
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.680
the sad part is that
specifically for representation of

44
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.319
bisexual men there's Next To None
um

45
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.180
there there's a bit more representation
for bisexual women but for bisexual men

46
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.700
it's just kind of like non-existent
because people still very much have you

47
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.760
know this this mindset that
if a character is bisexual they're only

48
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.459
bisexual until like if a guy if a male
character is bisexual he's only bisexual

49
00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.760
until he
um

50
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.079
gets a girlfriend or hooks up with a
girl then he's straight and then you

51
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.040
know if he doesn't hook up with another
guy if he doesn't

52
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520
um get a boyfriend or something like
that then he's just straight oh he was

53
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.660
in a phase he's straight now which is
incredibly infuriating

54
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.100
um
as a gay person who you know is always

55
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.400
interested in male male relationships in
media whether they be gay or bisexual

56
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.060
that kind of write-off and this is this
comes from a lot this isn't just like

57
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.780
straight people doing the writing off
this is gay people too gay people are

58
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.060
just as horrid as straight people in
this account where a lot of gay people

59
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.300
kind of look at bisexual people
especially bisexual men and they're like

60
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.919
so you'll like the dick but you want to
go home to a wifey and it's like oh my

61
00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.000
God guys
um so with that little tirade out of the

62
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.380
way
um I can't really

63
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.699
think of a whole lot

64
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.660
as I type away
I can't really think of a whole lot of

65
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.080
movies or TV shows with a lot of
bisexual representation oh God Netflix

66
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.039
is making noise
um yeah obviously I should not be doing

67
00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.180
these alone I'm horrible at this
um

68
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.380
but um

69
00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.500
yeah I can't really think of a whole lot
of

70
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.220
movies or TV shows that specifically
have

71
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.800
male bisexual representation
um I can think of ones that have you

72
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.199
know like male gay representation I mean
there's Heart Stopper of course which

73
00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:02.460
Nick is a not Nick my production partner
but Nick in the show

74
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.759
um
is bisexual and actually has

75
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.100
like a really sweet coming out storyline
there

76
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.259
um
there was a Netflix movie that came out

77
00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.740
a while ago
and I'm blanking on the name of it now

78
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.479
I'm trying to hunt it down
here

79
00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.759
um
and I'm sure so many of you are

80
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.860
listening right now and you're just kind
of like screaming it out

81
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.419
into the void because you're like I know
what he's talking about

82
00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.560
um
oh my God this is this is so frustrating

83
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.780
why is a Caitlyn Jenner documentary
being recommended to me Alex Strangelove

84
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.240
um if I remember correctly Alex
Strangelove is a teenager who is coming

85
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.800
to terms with his bisexuality and
um

86
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.819
that's
honestly the only

87
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.819
movie I can think of with any male
bisexual representation

88
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.940
um there's a bit more on TV shows
um if you watch

89
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.099
like American Horror Story bisexual guys
have popped up uh on different seasons

90
00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.919
of that
um

91
00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:29.340
but a lot of times it's it's kind of uh
I find when there's a bisexual male

92
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.639
character it's very lip servicey
um

93
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.780
for instance David from shit's creek is
I can't remember if he identifies as

94
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.919
bisexual or pansexual
um

95
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:50.340
but he is not you know like 100 gay but
we only really see him in relationships

96
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:57.960
in the show with dudes and that's kind
of how I find a lot of bisexual rep

97
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.740
for male characters goes is that it's
you know like I said they're they're

98
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:11.220
basically gay with an Asterix asterisk
asterisks asterisk

99
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.699
um
which is really disappointing

100
00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:19.440
um
you know I can recommend like gay stuff

101
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.539
up and down which I'm actually thinking
about doing a I did the video that was

102
00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:29.039
breaking down you know the quote-unquote
best gay movies I'm actually thinking

103
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:34.800
about doing one that's just actually my
own opinion and not just taking

104
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.459
um movies from lists that had been
pre-ordained as the best gay movies

105
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:45.720
um
so look out for that one but

106
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.700
um
Alex Strangelove is a cute movie and

107
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.839
Heart Stopper obviously is like
painfully adorable

108
00:08:54.839 --> 00:09:01.260
um there's a lot of why a books with
bisexual male characters and I'm feeling

109
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.459
like a dumbass now because I can't
remember them I maybe should have

110
00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:10.980
prepared for this and I'm really sorry
um I don't know if this pop Filter Works

111
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.860
or how I'm this new microphone is it's
weird and it's all metal and stuff

112
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.959
anyway
um

113
00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:23.459
but yeah I
Pro there's I probably should have

114
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:27.360
prepared for this instead of just going
in and reading the questions and giving

115
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.940
my uh unfiltered answers
which by the looks of things are going

116
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.980
to be long answers
um long rambling answers of nothing

117
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.920
um
yeah unfortunately other than Alex

118
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.500
Strangelove and Heart Stopper
uh even with hurtstopper I mean we don't

119
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.040
see Nick with a girl really
um

120
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.080
and I don't think we're going to I mean
we don't really in the comics so you

121
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.680
know however that ends up but
um

122
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:06.360
unfortunately there's not a lot of good
bisexual representation for men not a

123
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.899
whole lot of good bisexual
representation for women either

124
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:13.080
um
which is you know

125
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.180
a problem that ought to be rectified
um

126
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.480
but yeah I'm sorry that I couldn't give
you a better answer there but there's

127
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.700
two examples you've probably already
seen Heart Stopper in all likelihood

128
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.360
um
if you're just kind of looking for

129
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.399
gay good gay movies there is the the
video that I have out ranking the

130
00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:39.120
quote-unquote best queer movies ever
made

131
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.080
um
and uh that's a that's a pretty safe

132
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.760
safe space to Safe space safe place to
go

133
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.519
to find uh some good recommendations
for Stuff

134
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:58.100
and I'm sorry that I was not more
prepared for that question

135
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.459
um so the next question is Interview
with the Vampire has got me wondering

136
00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:07.380
what some of your favorite vampire media
is queer or otherwise I say like all

137
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.940
vampires aren't a little queer primarily
interested in movies and shows but I

138
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.160
would love to hear what books and even
games and other media you might pick

139
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.660
um well I think
the current TV show of Interview with

140
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.839
the Vampire is currently my favorite
vampire thing

141
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:29.339
like as far as movies and TV shows go
like it is completely exceeding my

142
00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:31.920
expectations
um

143
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.500
brem stoker is Dracula the 1992 movie
directed by Francis Ford Coppola that is

144
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.740
a phenomenal movie it's a bit messy
um in that you know Keanu Reeves had not

145
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.000
quite figured out how to act yet
um

146
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.519
and but it is just it's it's horror
Peak horror camp and it's wonderful

147
00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:01.700
um
and then we've got you know the original

148
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:07.320
Nosferatu with count orlock which I love
because it's a it's you know it's

149
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.300
not doing the handsome vampire shtick
which really

150
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:18.360
um rose up with
um Bella lugosi's Dracula in 1933 I want

151
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:24.360
to say it's either 1933 or 1930. or
every one of those years in between

152
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.500
um I'm pretty sure it's 33. but uh
and True Blood I I know True Blood has

153
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.060
kind of like Fallen people a lot of
people I feel like don't talk they don't

154
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.300
remember True Blood at this point
because it did kind of go off the rails

155
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.779
near the end but those first couple of
seasons

156
00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:49.440
are really good like I I loved them
unironically like as it got later on and

157
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.779
we started dealing with the FAE and and
uh wear Panthers and stuff like that it

158
00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:59.220
got a little bit hokey but it was still
fun still fun to watch

159
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.940
um
and True Blood was

160
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.220
took a lot of inspiration from
you know Anne Rice's vampires in that

161
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.180
they're basically all bisexual
um

162
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.000
so if you want some good but you know
again if you want some good male

163
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.180
bisexual rep watching Vampire stuff
because

164
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.760
you know Anne Rice's vampires and um
and True Blood you've got a lot of

165
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.620
bisexual vampires there
um

166
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.420
books-wise Salem's Lot by Stephen King I
think is a really good vampire story

167
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.079
it's one of the rare vampire stories
that have come out recently that's

168
00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:43.380
actually a horror story and not just uh
not romanticizing the vampire

169
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:48.120
um
and the Simon snow books which aren't

170
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.040
really vampire books but
um

171
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.579
it's kind of it well it literally
started out as Harry Potter fan fiction

172
00:13:56.579 --> 00:14:01.440
and the Draco analogy
um

173
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:08.339
or analog is a vampire he was made into
a vampire and uh there's a lot of

174
00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:12.120
vampire characters in there and so I
really like those I talked about that on

175
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.420
the most recent stream
um and how I think there really ought to

176
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.800
be more than three books because I feel
like three books is really cheating

177
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.560
the audience out of what could be a
fantastic ongoing series every book

178
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.579
series that I like I feel should be like
Discworld it should just go on and on

179
00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:33.779
and on and on and on and on unending
just never end never let the author

180
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:38.540
write anything different just continue
with the hat

181
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.040
sorry I had to take a drink of water
uh the next question I was really happy

182
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.339
when I saw you were planning on talking
about my favorite anime revolutionary

183
00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:52.470
girl otena and that got me wondering if
you've heard of scene

184
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.729
[Music]

185
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.899
uh there are other two gay anime
uh your thoughts on them would really be

186
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.320
interesting to hear as they're layered
in symbolism I have not heard of them

187
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.260
and I'm assuming that name I couldn't
pronounce

188
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.899
um is the either producer or mangaka
behind revolutionary girl Lieutenant

189
00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:16.260
revolutionary girl utena
oh that's going to be difficult to say

190
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
like a thousand times when I do the
video

191
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.220
um
but no I haven't uh checked out any of

192
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.240
their other stuff but I will uh check it
out for the video I will look into that

193
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.459
because I
would like the video to be as

194
00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:36.779
comprehensive as possible so I will
definitely look into that

195
00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:41.579
the next question is sorry if you've
answered this before but do you think

196
00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:49.139
you'll make or use a letterbox to count
I actually do have a letterbox to count

197
00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:53.899
um
I think

198
00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:00.079
let's see if I have a letterboxed
account I'm pretty sure I do

199
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.459
sign in

200
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:12.600
I do I knew I had one I just haven't
been using it like ever

201
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.699
okay I have an account but like where
are my movies

202
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.540
he has an ad for a camera accessory that
I really want but I shouldn't buy

203
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.220
because it's a thousand dollars

204
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:34.820
okay yeah this looks like
I might have done a list

205
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.000
um so obviously I'm not very good at
letterboxed

206
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.560
um even though I have one
I wonder if I can

207
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.019
I'll put the
um

208
00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:53.519
link to my profile I'm sure there's a
way I can do that

209
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:59.100
probably with that button no not that
button I'll figure that out I'll put it

210
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:05.579
in the description of uh
of this podcast so that you can follow

211
00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:10.559
me I guess and
once I actually kind of get the hang of

212
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:17.160
it oh yeah okay now I see yeah all the
all of them all of my like rankings on

213
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.559
here are really high because I don't I
feel bad giving things a bad ranking

214
00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:29.280
like my lowest one is
three stars for Eraserhead

215
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.900
which
a lot of film fans will like want to

216
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.280
string me up for
because and I also gave three and a half

217
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.500
stars to The Shining Stanley kubricks
The Shining but five stars to scream

218
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.039
so it kind of tells you what my taste in
movies are

219
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.780
um
but yeah I do have letterbox and I

220
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.500
should use it more because you know I'm
kind of I guess I'm kind of a movie

221
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.200
YouTuber
um

222
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.340
I never really think of myself as one
but I think I'm a part of that space

223
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.940
kind of
um I should do more movie reviews on the

224
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.720
new channel which I'll also link down in
the description

225
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.660
um
and maybe then I can kind of break into

226
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:23.280
the movie the film YouTube space
with all of those people whose reviews I

227
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.520
watch

228
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.820
um
the next question has a reply oh they

229
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.020
second this question okay
um so this question is I was wondering

230
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.480
if you know the Montag siblings series
of books by Mackenzie Lee the first one

231
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.140
is called Gentleman's Guide device and
virtue which deals with sexual identity

232
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.179
and society's expectations and if you
did what you thought of it I read

233
00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:55.020
Gentleman's Guide to Vice and virtue
and absolutely adored it and when I

234
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.440
heard that there was a sequel coming out
Ivan was so excited

235
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.000
and then the sequel wasn't about
their

236
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.940
the the the queer the the gay guys it
was about their sister one of the one of

237
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.660
them has a sister and it was about her
uh and then the third book I think is

238
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.460
about a whole other character entirely
um

239
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:23.940
and at the time there was a lot of
female authors

240
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.740
um
writing gay books as their first book

241
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:34.080
and then when that
became a huge hit their second book

242
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.280
would either be straight or it would be
dealing with

243
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.160
um
uh women in some way whether they were

244
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.520
straight women or lesbians or bisexual
what have you and I I was irked that it

245
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.760
seemed to me anyway that these authors
knew that there was a huge fan base from

246
00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.720
both gay readers and a lot of uh
girls and and women reading them

247
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.200
um for gay male books especially in the
why a sphere

248
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.240
and that they were breaking into it with
that kind of book and then once they got

249
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.440
their audience when they once they got
their success they you know switched

250
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.200
gears and went in a different direction
and either went in a straight direction

251
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.580
or you know lesbian Direction bisexual
what have you but they kind of left the

252
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.039
gay male representation behind
and that irked me really badly at the

253
00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:35.760
time
um not so much now

254
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.539
um but I've heard things about Mackenzie
Lee

255
00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:45.240
as a person
that kind of put me off that

256
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.500
um they were a bit full of themselves I
might be completely wrong they may be an

257
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.179
amazing person this was like book
Twitter hearsay so don't take that as

258
00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:57.840
gospel for God's sake
um

259
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.640
but uh
I also I think Mackenzie Lee also wrote

260
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.700
a Loki book for Marvel uh not a comic
book a novel about young Loki and if I

261
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:16.200
remember correctly Loki does not do any
queering queerable things in that book

262
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.220
which also put me off
um but yeah I really liked the first

263
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.059
book the first book was fantastic I I
love those kind of swashbuckling

264
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:30.299
Adventure novels and having it be you
know the adventurers be gay guys was

265
00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:36.120
just right up my alley so I loved that
first book and so if you like the the

266
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.340
first book or if you check out the first
book you'll probably will like

267
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.260
the the ones that follow I just have a a
sour spot

268
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.940
because I'm I'm bitter

269
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.320
more water

270
00:21:54.659 --> 00:21:58.320
I'm out of water oh no there's another
bottle yay

271
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.919
um
next question is since one of your

272
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:06.539
future videos will be about BL which
ones have you watched and what are your

273
00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:10.080
favorites and why if you have one of
course

274
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.140
um that's a good question
I've watched a couple

275
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:19.559
let's
find

276
00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:22.220
them

277
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.880
semantic error I watched that this year
that was really good

278
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.000
um

279
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.980
I thought it was very kind of
very cute and adorable

280
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.159
um

281
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.440
your name engraved herein
um

282
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.900
Yuri on Ice obviously but that I love
that Yuri on ice is counted as a a VL

283
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.400
even though it's anime

284
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:03.240
even is counted as a BL that's
interesting

285
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.020
um
see I've watched a couple not as many as

286
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.000
I I'm gonna watch more before I do the
video obviously but I've watched

287
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.060
probably
[Music]

288
00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:22.140
seven I wanna say seven
um

289
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.000
I think semantic error semantic error
was probably my favorite one

290
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.340
uh that I've watched so far
um other than you know the anime ones

291
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.179
like uh given and Yuri on ice and stuff
like that

292
00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:40.700
um but yeah I would say that uh semantic
error is my favorite one

293
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:47.299
uh it just kind of
I liked the the sort of uh

294
00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:52.980
the Rivalry tension the rivals to lovers
kind of thing

295
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.659
um
but I'll be diving headlong into that

296
00:23:57.659 --> 00:24:03.059
before I get into the video the video is
mostly going to be about the industry of

297
00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:09.539
BL and how it's you know it exists in
this weird

298
00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:15.360
weird kind of
Zone that it's incredibly it's an

299
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:24.720
incredibly successful genre
um of media in Asia and

300
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:30.360
it has made its way to the west and
people who wouldn't otherwise be

301
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.440
watching you know subtitled media are
watching it

302
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.659
and Hollywood is just kind of like is
facing the other way going what do you

303
00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:43.559
mean what's all this noise behind me no
I can't turn around and look at it what

304
00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:47.280
are you talking about and it's so it's
gonna really be looking at the business

305
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.940
side of things but I will be
highlighting uh a couple of BL

306
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.100
shows as well as some of the more
problematic things in the genre

307
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:04.559
um because some of them can be a bit
violent some of them can be very okay

308
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:09.179
this one's the girl and you know just
kind of it's straight but they filed off

309
00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:11.940
the serial numbers
um

310
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.620
um so uh
yeah it'll be an interesting video if uh

311
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.440
if I get to do it gotta get those Patron
numbers up

312
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.260
uh next question is I believe you
mentioned Neil Gaiman is a straight Ally

313
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.700
that writes surprisingly good LGBT plus
characters and that made me think have

314
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.940
you read Terry Pratchett and what do you
think of his betrayal of LGBT plus

315
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.080
narratives I find the particularly
interesting after turfs tried to claim

316
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.880
that Terry would agree with them whereas
his family and friends like Neil and

317
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.260
many of his fans being included found
that Preposterous yeah like I haven't

318
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.840
read that much Terry pratchett's stuff
but I watched a lot of interviews with

319
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.880
him
um

320
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.440
followed a lot of his of a bit followed
a lot of his opinions in his later years

321
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:04.260
and
um the idea that

322
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:11.159
he would be anything other than the most
Progressive and open-minded just boggled

323
00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:14.760
my mind
um

324
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.760
so like so I haven't read a whole lot of
his stuff I've read a bit a couple of

325
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:27.840
things from Discworld mostly the uh the
death novels and the The Witches

326
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.059
um Obviously good Omens
um which I'll be doing a video on

327
00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:39.960
later this year yes November I think
um

328
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.279
which is perfect timing because they
released the post the new poster uh for

329
00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:47.400
good omen season two and the wings are
in the shape of the heart and I'm like

330
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.220
oh my God they're doing it they're going
there

331
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.039
um so yeah
but I'd like to read more of Terry

332
00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:56.039
pratchett's stuff I think he's very
[Music]

333
00:26:56.039 --> 00:27:00.419
um
his his books are really funny and kind

334
00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:04.919
of lyrical
and I when I'm reading I read things

335
00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:10.260
like their thrillers
and because his writing style doesn't

336
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.460
mesh up with that it's hard for me to
sit down and read the book

337
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.400
um so there's something that there there
are books that I think I would like to

338
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.539
check out on like audible or something
like that because I really love his

339
00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:27.000
characters and the world that he built
and everything but his writing style

340
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.480
doesn't mesh with how I read but would
be perfectly fine with listening to a

341
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.600
book

342
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.140
uh that's that actually plays into
um

343
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.900
like right now with House of the Dragon
I I bought I owned the house of the

344
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.720
House of the Dragon book but I only got
about 30 pages into it but I got through

345
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.240
the audiobook in like two sittings of
Minecraft so sometimes it you know

346
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:04.080
depending upon the uh the writing style
you know listening to the audiobook

347
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.480
works a lot better for me whereas
sometimes it's just like I can just dive

348
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.260
into a book

349
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:19.080
so the next question is I haven't been a
fan for very long so you may have

350
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.059
already covered this but how do you feel
about the rich enough to be a trollop

351
00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:27.659
lesbian
Rich enough to be a trollop lesbian

352
00:28:27.659 --> 00:28:33.480
Trope I've encountered it so much lately
I've been calling them lesbians with a

353
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.740
dollar sign in the s for short I'm on
the fence about it on the one hand

354
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.159
historical context but on the other so
bored

355
00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:48.320
I don't know if I've come across this
um

356
00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:58.200
so so would that be like Rich enough to
get away with it

357
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.380
um

358
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:08.360
I don't think I've come across it so I'm
I'm missing some some media here

359
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.179
because

360
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.740
although maybe it's like shows like
Elite and stuff like that where

361
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.299
people are just ridiculously rich and
good looking and so they can get away

362
00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:25.200
with doing basically anything
um

363
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.240
another one might be like the favorite
where you have you know people in the

364
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:36.419
Royal Court who are
lesbians or bisexual women and they're

365
00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:40.620
getting away with it there's not real
controversy over it because they're rich

366
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.740
what are you gonna do
um

367
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:48.299
I thought they were actually going to do
that and hosted the dragon with uh

368
00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:54.779
Rainier and Allison of really getting uh
lesbian vibes from them and then they

369
00:29:54.779 --> 00:29:57.960
didn't do it so I was really
dissatisfied with that

370
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.440
um
but yeah I don't think I've come across

371
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.740
that so
um but I would actually really

372
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:12.899
appreciate it if you could leave some
examples of that because that

373
00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:18.360
would actually really play into a video
that I'm planning another one about

374
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.520
being gay and having money and uh I
would really appreciate that so that I

375
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.179
can check them out

376
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.039
okay the next question is could you walk
us through your creative process of

377
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:35.760
making video essays
um

378
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.220
it used to be pure chaos but it's
getting more organized now it used to be

379
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:46.200
literally like
I would come up with an idea and I'd be

380
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.659
like Nick we're gonna do this
and then we would have to dive into

381
00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:57.659
either watching a TV show or reading a
book or a manga or something like that

382
00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:03.539
and uh it was complete chaos
but lately it's been way more organized

383
00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:09.899
so what we do now is
we

384
00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:15.899
find a piece of media that we want to
talk about like uh for instance I can

385
00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:20.159
use
um Banana Fish as a good example

386
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:25.020
I really wanted to make a video about
Banana Fish people had recommended me

387
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.080
the anime and said they wanted me to
make a video about it

388
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.460
I watched it I fell in love with the
anime

389
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.779
um Ash is alive always and forever
um

390
00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:40.799
but
having watched it I'm like okay so I can

391
00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:44.399
do an I can do a video where I kind of
recap it

392
00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:49.260
but what am I gonna say like what's the
point of doing that

393
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.860
like
of doing an hour-long video just

394
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.480
recapping a TV show
I know a lot of people do that on

395
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.740
YouTube and they do quite well with
those videos but it's not something that

396
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.880
I feel like I could do on a long-term
basis I'm doing it on the second Channel

397
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:12.299
now with Interview with the Vampire but
that's like 10 minute videos talking

398
00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:15.500
about an hour long episode

399
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.960
um and so
trying to figure out what do we do

400
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.640
what can we say with this video so that
it's not just a recap of an anime

401
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.919
and in in that particular case I tried
to get Nick to watch the anime and he

402
00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:35.940
hated it he didn't I think he got past I
think he got episode two

403
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.860
uh he got a bit further into the manga
but hated the manga even more

404
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.520
um
so we just started kind of spitballing

405
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.399
it and this is what we end up doing is
we sit at uh when we were living

406
00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:51.200
together we would sit at the kitchen
table

407
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.340
and just talk about it
and

408
00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:02.279
we would end up talking about it for
three hours three or four hours

409
00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:08.279
and somewhere in that discussion we
would have found a theme

410
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:14.100
and with banana fish for instance the
theme was

411
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:21.299
the historical kind of connection
between being gay and being a criminal

412
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:27.299
and so
then we we had our theme for the video

413
00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:31.260
and a lot of people watch that video in
particular and you know the first

414
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.880
probably 20 minutes are Banana Fish and
then the next 30 minutes are talking

415
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.659
about
um the history of

416
00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:44.460
gay criminals basically and then for the
last like five minutes of the video we

417
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.500
were rounded back to Banana Fish and we
kind of tie up the knot and

418
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:56.039
that's kind of what we try to do
um we try to we take a piece of media

419
00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:59.880
that we're that at least one of us is
usually I'm excited about it or both of

420
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.360
us is
um Nick doesn't

421
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.359
really watch a whole lot of stuff on
their own so it's usually stuff that I'm

422
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:12.659
excited about or that I have forced upon
him

423
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.619
um
and then we kind of take this thing that

424
00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:20.820
we're excited about and figure out the
theme for it

425
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.800
um there are
some more recent examples would be

426
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:31.139
stranger things for instance and how I
wanted to do a video about stranger

427
00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.339
things I wasn't really sure what to do
with the video because I was like okay

428
00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:39.960
well I want to talk about Robin and will
and stuff like that who we barely

429
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.980
mentioned either of them I don't think
we mentioned Robin at all in the video

430
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.099
um
because it ended up becoming you know

431
00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:51.359
the sort of
not how you know

432
00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:57.320
nostalgia
how nostalgic and really cloud history

433
00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:03.420
and how we look at history and how
because we look at history a different

434
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.400
way we're not remembering it the right
way and therefore we are you know doomed

435
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.380
to repeat the mistakes of History
um

436
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:19.619
and uh so that's another one sometimes
it's very Cut and Clear like with the

437
00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:24.060
the new monsters Out of the Closet video
dysphiria the newest one

438
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:31.260
that one didn't have a theme going into
it I was just like I'm going to talk

439
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:36.960
about recent horror movies and how
they're getting queerer

440
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.780
and I read a couple of books I read a
bunch of Articles and I just went to

441
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.619
town and wrote the script
that's one of the rare scripts that I

442
00:35:46.619 --> 00:35:49.920
actually wrote myself
um

443
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:57.000
but yeah that's basically the process we
figure out a show or movie that we're

444
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.859
excited about and figure out an
overarching theme for it so that it's

445
00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:06.540
not just you know 40 minutes about
um

446
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.680
Spider-Man or something
excuse me

447
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.500
um
and then

448
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.480
build off of it from there Nick usually
takes charge of the script because we'll

449
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.140
sit down and we'll figure out okay how
long is this video probably going to be

450
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.700
is it going to be a half hour long or is
it going to be an hour long and from

451
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.320
there we figure out okay how many parts
are going to be in this video and there

452
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.960
is always
universally always one more part than we

453
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.540
plan
um

454
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.680
every time every single time
so if we say it's going to have an

455
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.119
introduction and then six parts it will
have an intro and seven Parts every time

456
00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:52.380
uh and that's usually because when the
script is quote unquote finished I jump

457
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.200
into it and end up adding something
um

458
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.820
and uh so yeah that's I sorry for the
rambling answer but that's kind of the

459
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.440
process that we do we kind of sit down
we

460
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.960
figure out okay what's the script
what's the structure of the script how

461
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.980
many parts are there okay there's six
parts what is what is each part going to

462
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.040
say
because you know we know what the

463
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.380
closing message is we know what the the
the thesis statement is and so we have

464
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.220
to figure out okay there's six parts how
can we make sure that all of these parts

465
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.380
lead to that message
and then when it's all wrapped up in the

466
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.460
video and all of the smart stuff is done
and

467
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.619
which is mostly written by Nick I I do
write you know a good chunk of the video

468
00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:47.220
help write a good chunk of the videos
um

469
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.480
but not
Nick does the bulk of it and then I do

470
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:57.420
the bulk of the video editing shooting
that kind of stuff on the other end

471
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.720
um
so then once the script is done I come

472
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:07.140
in and I write the closer to it and you
know that's where I wrap everything up

473
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.740
into a bow and I'm like okay let's bring
back the stuff that we talked about in

474
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.599
part one and part two in the
introduction let's bring that back and

475
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:22.980
that way when the video is over you feel
like you've had a complete experience

476
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.079
uh next question
do you have any rituals or routines in

477
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:32.460
your daily life
other than taking vitamins I don't I

478
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.780
don't think I do I probably should
because I

479
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.040
[Music]
um

480
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:47.040
my days are are a mess some days I will
get up at like eight in the morning

481
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.480
which I know is not that early for a lot
of people but for me it's very early

482
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.820
um
I'll get up at like eight in the morning

483
00:38:53.820 --> 00:39:00.599
and I'll start doing stuff I will start
um whether it's setting up

484
00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:08.040
um a set to shoot on or
going out to you know maybe I need to

485
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.240
get groceries or I need to go buy
something for a video

486
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.960
um
whatever it might be and I will spend a

487
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.520
whole day working
and

488
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.760
then there are some days where I won't
get out of bed until like five in the

489
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.240
afternoon
and it's not even like a oh I'm

490
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.060
depressed and so I'm laying in bed it's
just

491
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.900
well I have nothing else to do so I'm
just gonna lay here and watch Bob's

492
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:38.460
Burgers
um that's usually what I'm watching

493
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.920
um
because and I don't know why

494
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.720
that ends up happening
um where sometimes I just kind of shut

495
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.880
down for a day or two and like this week
has been because I've been sick I've

496
00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:01.560
been in bed a lot basically I will my
for most of the last week my greatest

497
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:08.640
uh energy expenditure has been getting
up from bed walking out into the living

498
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.480
room and sitting on the couch and
turning my PlayStation on

499
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.440
and watching a TV show
um

500
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.420
but the you know I was sick so I'll give
myself a break there but yeah like

501
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:27.500
sometimes it will be like super
productive days and other days are just

502
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:34.500
non-existent and I wish I had more kind
of routines in my day I wish I had like

503
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.000
a writing routine for instance where I
could get up and

504
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.680
you know make a smoothie uh have some
tea and start writing something whether

505
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.599
that be a script or a novel or a video
essay

506
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:57.119
um
and you know be able to build a routine

507
00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:00.000
around that
whereas

508
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.380
I am a complete I bump the microphone
thing

509
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:09.660
whereas I am just a complete mess when
it comes to routine uh except when I'm

510
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.619
editing
when I am editing a video

511
00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:19.680
I go into a very strict routine
which is literally

512
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.700
I wake up
I have some tea I have a smoothie I sit

513
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.720
down at my computer
I edit

514
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.700
um a section
uh and that's that's why my videos are

515
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.839
all broken up into chapters partially so
that it's easier to come back to the

516
00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:40.380
video like if you have to take a break
from it or something like that but part

517
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.780
but also partially so that it's easier
to edit because this way

518
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.060
um
I

519
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.740
can basically edit a small 10 minute
video

520
00:41:52.740 --> 00:42:00.180
and then it's like okay this is done
and then when that is done however long

521
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.440
that takes sometimes it might be you
know as short as three or four hours

522
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:10.320
sometimes it might take 12 hours to edit
the 10 minutes it all depends on the

523
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.000
videos that are required how many videos
need to be downloaded is it just you

524
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.240
know is it videos that I already know
need to be there like b-roll from a

525
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:23.520
movie or do I need to find stuff
um like archive news footage which is

526
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.700
much harder to find
um

527
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.079
especially without Giant watermarks on
it and

528
00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:36.599
so it can take a lot longer
but then no matter how long it if it

529
00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:40.980
takes like 12 hours then I'll stop
I'll have dinner

530
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.000
I'll watch some videos on YouTube I'll
watch a TV show

531
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.099
and then I will go in
and

532
00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:54.720
you know if it's a if I got it done in a
pretty short amount of time after I'm

533
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.240
done eating and everything I'll go do
another one

534
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:03.540
uh if it took a long time I don't just
stop I go back and I do the audio edit

535
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:08.520
for it which is basically cutting out
the ums and Oz and stuff like that which

536
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.859
I wish I could do with these podcasts
because I um a lot in the podcast but I

537
00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:17.180
don't have the patience to do it here

538
00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:21.839
um
and uh so going in and doing that audio

539
00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:26.520
edit and that way
you know I can then get a shower go to

540
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:32.579
bed you know relax for a bit and then
come back in the morning and I'm not

541
00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:37.380
starting from scratch I'm already
halfway done of something and I do that

542
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.020
process I always try and leave it so
that something's unfinished which I can

543
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.839
imagine would drive a lot of people
crazy

544
00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:49.200
um
have it you know going to bed with

545
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.339
something unfinished but for me it's not
going to bed with something unfinished

546
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:59.099
it's the kick in the ass I need the next
day the next morning to get started

547
00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:03.359
because otherwise I might just end up
you know

548
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:07.560
being lethargic the next day and being
like oh well I'll get to it but because

549
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.300
it's it's literally hanging there on the
screen and I leave the screen on

550
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.300
um
on my editing computer I leave it on all

551
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.819
night so that when I leave the bedroom
Final Cut is staring at me and the the

552
00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:25.380
video is staring at me and it's like I'm
unfinished

553
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:31.260
so it kind of gives me the kick in the
ass I need to get started on it right

554
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:36.119
away and then so I have that very strict
routine when I'm editing videos for

555
00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:39.540
everything else I have like nothing
except I take vitamins when I as soon as

556
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:44.520
I wake up in the morning along with my
uh seizure and anxiety medication and

557
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.960
then I do that again at 9 30 at night
which if you've ever seen me stream the

558
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.940
streams are inevitably interrupted by my
phone telling me to take my pills

559
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.319
um
and uh yeah other than that I don't have

560
00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:02.640
any
rituals or routines

561
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:09.200
but I should probably find something
like yoga or something to kind of

562
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:15.240
try to straighten out my mind
um next question is how do you stay

563
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.980
inspired and creative but without
burning out

564
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.960
um oddly I
I've been doing this

565
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.720
full time
you'd I've been doing YouTube full time

566
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.599
um since
May of 2021 so for about a year and a

567
00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:40.200
half
and before that I was doing it full time

568
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.300
and working full-time
um so

569
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:50.940
which was exhausting
um doing YouTube full-time and

570
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:56.579
um working full-time for instance the
um if you remember back in I think

571
00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:00.380
February of 2021

572
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:07.079
um
I did a big long charity stream

573
00:46:07.079 --> 00:46:12.960
um for a trans youth charity
and we Nick and I played Ocarina of Time

574
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.760
and I think 100 did it
um

575
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.060
it was like a third it was a 36 hour
stream I wish it was still on YouTube

576
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.980
but anything over 10 hours YouTube
doesn't allow to be up and I can't even

577
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:31.380
they won't even let me download the file
to like upload in chunks so that sucks

578
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.700
but
um I did that

579
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:41.220
I we started that on a Friday evening
after I had worked all day

580
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.380
at my normal job for instance
um which was doing marketing for a

581
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.980
school
um

582
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.300
so I

583
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.760
I really love doing this I love coming
up with the ideas for videos I love

584
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.740
shooting the videos editing the videos
releasing the videos like

585
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.660
all of it I just I love all of it even
the really hard ones like the gay Panic

586
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.579
video and the get Holocaust video and
stuff like that the ones that are really

587
00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:19.500
hard to do and sometimes like I had to
do for the gay Panic video that took a

588
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:24.180
year between me finishing the script and
actually shooting it and then the gay

589
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:31.140
Holocaust video I took three weeks off
after releasing part one it was

590
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.700
originally released as two parts
I released part one and then I took

591
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.079
three weeks off before I even started
editing part two because it was already

592
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:43.440
dark and part two was when we got to the
camps

593
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.119
so it was already
like hard to deal with

594
00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.579
um
but I think that's probably like the

595
00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:54.240
longest break
I took

596
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.420
um

597
00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.920
I I didn't even take a break when my mom
died

598
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:06.540
because of scheduling the Banana Fish
video actually was published the night

599
00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.700
my mom passed away
so technically I was

600
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:17.400
working
at my mom's bedside so that was

601
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.780
that that was interesting
um you know there were I wasn't working

602
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.200
there were comments coming in on the
video people were commenting on it but I

603
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.500
wasn't I wasn't reading them but you
know

604
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.700
that had been published at a I had
scheduled that to be published at an odd

605
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.160
time
um

606
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:40.380
but I I love doing this so much and
that's why

607
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.579
you know I'm so thankful for you guys
for letting me do this

608
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:48.960
because I can't think of other than like
making movies I can't think of a job

609
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.900
that would be more fun than this
um that said I don't do most of the

610
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.640
writing
I do on any given video

611
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:05.760
on average I would say I do about 30 of
the writing some videos like Monsters

612
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.780
out of the closet I did all the writing
for the queers folk video a couple of

613
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.560
other ones recently the gay Panic video
the gay Holocaust video I did all the

614
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.140
writing on those
um

615
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.640
the earlier videos
um but

616
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.599
Nick does get burnt out
um

617
00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:28.020
because
doing the writing and they're the

618
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:34.260
researching and everything is exhausting
and a lot of times before

619
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:41.280
um we got so many patrons we were
entirely reliant on YouTube

620
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.140
ad Revenue
and so if we put out a video and it

621
00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:50.040
might be like an hour-long video that
we've just spent a month working on

622
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.640
and we put it out and the views aren't
there

623
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.819
it's like okay we need a new video out
next week

624
00:49:56.819 --> 00:49:59.780
and then

625
00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:06.540
that fell on us to get out in the next
week which

626
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.920
basically meant so so that we could pay
rent that month

627
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:16.200
and that basically meant
Nick had to write between five and ten

628
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:21.240
thousand words in two days
so that we would have two days to shoot

629
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.200
it and then I would have two days to
edit it

630
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:30.119
um
and then hope to God that YouTube didn't

631
00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:37.020
demonetize it or pull some copyright
Shenanigans and stuff like that so

632
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:41.040
um luckily that doesn't happen anymore
because you guys are amazing and have

633
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.819
made it so that we don't have to deal
with that anymore uh because even if a

634
00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:48.300
video doesn't do great it's not the end
of the world we know where rent's gonna

635
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.300
be paid
um

636
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.980
so it's it is taken so much stress off
of us

637
00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:00.780
to be able to do that uh and that's all
thanks to you guys and sorry for this

638
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:06.180
um kind of just complete non-sequitur
off into thank youville but thank you

639
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.380
um
um but yeah Nick is definitely more

640
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.619
prone to burnout because this isn't what
Nick

641
00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:17.640
plans to be doing for the rest of their
life Nick wants to be a novelist Nick

642
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:22.380
has a novel that's been released uh
gentlemen's club

643
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.420
um and that's what Nick wants to do and
this is you know probably a much easier

644
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:32.700
and he's told me is a much easier job
than any other one that he's ever had

645
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.660
um but it's not you know his dream job
it's not my dream job either my dream

646
00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.559
job is making movies
but I kind of look at these as little

647
00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:45.599
movies and so it's it's much easier for
me to

648
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:50.339
um
just be excited about every new video

649
00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:54.260
that's going out
um

650
00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:03.200
but though Nick is more prone to burnout
that's never stopped Nick from

651
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.920
getting
the work done they are next an

652
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.420
incredible person who
really

653
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.500
pushes themselves so much harder
than

654
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.480
they really ought to and uh that's
another big thank you to you guys is

655
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.460
that you make it so that I can make sure
that he's paid properly because he

656
00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.240
deserves to be paid properly
um

657
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:35.339
all right now that I'm done just saying
thank you for 10 minutes uh three more

658
00:52:35.339 --> 00:52:39.780
questions the next one is why do you
wear so many mock turtlenecks is this a

659
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.500
Canadian thing or a turtlenecks just
your favorite will Nick appear in a

660
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.800
future video what do you like to eat for
breakfast

661
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:53.119
um this is several questions uh no it's
not a Canadian thing I am overweight

662
00:52:53.119 --> 00:53:00.480
and mo an odd amount of fat is held in
my neck

663
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.700
um I have you know a decent amount of
belly fat that's why you'd never see it

664
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.000
on camera
the you know the bottom of the frame is

665
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.619
always like at my chest but you know
it's manageable

666
00:53:13.619 --> 00:53:17.819
um if I wear the right clothes I don't
look horrible

667
00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:21.900
um but my neck
is so

668
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:27.599
I think my neck looks incredibly fat
and so I wear turtlenecks to hide that

669
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:30.240
that's it
um

670
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.020
if I actually managed to lose the weight
I want to lose I'm probably going to

671
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.640
stop wearing turtlenecks in every video
um because I'm not going to be so

672
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.440
self-conscious about my jiggly
double chin

673
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.400
so that's why I wear turtlenecks
um

674
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.200
I actually have
um

675
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:57.900
double-sided fabric tape it's meant for
strapless dresses but I use it for one

676
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.680
turtleneck that I have in particular
that's a very light fabric that I used

677
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.520
to have to wear all the time
because it was a light fabric so I could

678
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.300
wear it in the summer and not sweat to
death uh and so I would have to tape

679
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.040
that I would have to tape that to my
neck so that it wouldn't fall down

680
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.559
because it fell down I would see the fat
the double chin and just gets so

681
00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:23.339
self-conscious
during editing and then I would have to

682
00:54:23.339 --> 00:54:29.940
reshoot things so I would be using
double-sided tape to do that

683
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.740
um as for Nick appearing in another
video Nick doesn't like being on camera

684
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.819
very much
um even when we do streams together and

685
00:54:38.819 --> 00:54:43.740
it gets super self-conscious
um but he does want to do a video about

686
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:49.380
cyberpunk that he wants to do for the
channel and I don't know when that's

687
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:54.240
coming I don't know
really a whole lot about that we've

688
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.599
talked about the look of it and stuff
I'm excited because I'll get to be

689
00:54:57.599 --> 00:55:01.380
behind the camera so I'm really excited
for that

690
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.099
um
but other than that Nick will rarely be

691
00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:09.660
on camera I think
like he has

692
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.800
I am definitely not telling him not to
be on camera it's a it's a decision that

693
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.940
he's made
um and what do I like to eat for

694
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.559
breakfast breakfast is my favorite meal
because

695
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:26.460
you can get away with just having
protein for breakfast

696
00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:30.839
and
you know no one gives you a weird look

697
00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:34.260
because like if you're having dinner
it's like oh you're having steak or

698
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.140
chicken it's like well what's your side
and then it's like well maybe it's rice

699
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.520
or potatoes or vegetables and it's like
carbs carbs carbs carbs

700
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:48.839
um but for breakfast you can have bacon
and eggs and sausages and there you go

701
00:55:48.839 --> 00:55:54.300
and I can actually have toast because I
found this bread called carbonate that

702
00:55:54.300 --> 00:56:01.140
only has two grams of carbs
per slice because it has so much fiber

703
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.720
um
which has been a godsend because I love

704
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.800
sandwiches and it has allowed me to
continue to eat sandwiches

705
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.760
um so yeah
next question I mean if we're getting

706
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.180
personal what's your favorite brand of
toilet paper

707
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.800
cashmere
um

708
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.040
in all seriousness what's your favorite
news from the last New York City

709
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.839
Comic-Con and werewolf By Night how much
did you love or hate it on thoughts on

710
00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:32.280
why the straight boy reviewers all seem
to be shipping Ted man thing and Jack

711
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.240
the titular werewolf I actually haven't
gotten to watch it yet

712
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.680
um I want to watch it around Halloween
so that it's more of a

713
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:46.020
seasonal treat kind of thing because I
watched Hocus Pocus as soon as it came

714
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:51.180
out so there went my Halloween movie for
the year so uh yeah werewolf by night I

715
00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.260
want to watch for Halloween but I'm
excited that the straights are shipping

716
00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:01.559
man thing and uh Jack that's that's that
makes me excited to watch it after the

717
00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:06.059
the uh
completely meta fourth wall breaking

718
00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:09.900
finale of She-Hulk I'm excited to see
what Marvel does with when they become

719
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.200
playful
um

720
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.619
okay the last question is actually two
questions

721
00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:20.160
uh first what are some non-english queer
stories in media that you would

722
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.119
recommend bonus points for non-anime or
Korean manwa because I've read and

723
00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:29.339
watched a lot of those second have you
read my brother's husband and if so what

724
00:57:29.339 --> 00:57:32.819
do you think of it
um I've not read my brother's husband

725
00:57:32.819 --> 00:57:37.619
but it's in my to be read list
um

726
00:57:37.619 --> 00:57:43.140
as for what are some non-english queer
stories uh that you would recommend

727
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:51.000
um I mentioned this one in my best gay
movies list which is mandrakora which is

728
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.660
a movie out of the Czech Republic
um I don't think it is the Czech

729
00:57:54.660 --> 00:58:00.359
Republic anymore is it maybe it is um
but it's from what is or was the Czech

730
00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:03.059
Republic
um

731
00:58:03.059 --> 00:58:10.500
and uh it's a very dark movie
um like tonally but a incredible

732
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.660
incredible movie
um another one

733
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:20.480
uh let me find the title here

734
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.359
um

735
00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:37.160
oh I can't
remember the name of the movie

736
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.880
let's see here

737
00:58:48.059 --> 00:58:55.220
now okay I know where it would be
pretty sure

738
00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:01.319
I only have two examples because I don't
watch a whole lot of uh foreign films

739
00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:04.579
and it's not even because I'm like

740
00:59:04.619 --> 00:59:10.940
don't like foreign films it's because I
have a hard time with subtitles

741
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:16.500
um I believe
I have

742
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.700
it listed here

743
00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:23.819
da

744
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:33.420
okay I think it would be at the very end
sorry for the random speaking I'm trying

745
00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.160
to scrub through a vimeo video

746
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.099
uh

747
00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:48.319
oh

748
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:11.280
yes uh before the fall which is I
believe a German movie

749
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.000
um
yeah it's uh German movie it came out in

750
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.740
2004 and
it is about two gay

751
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:27.540
teenagers young adults
um

752
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:33.420
and uh
kind of how they are

753
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:38.579
drastically affected in a very sad way
by

754
01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:44.339
being in and around the Hitler Youth
and it's a very sad movie but it's a

755
01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:48.900
very good movie
um I used a lot of footage of it in

756
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.819
um pink triangles because I was like oh
cute German twinks this will help me get

757
01:00:53.819 --> 01:00:59.299
through the horrible other stuff

758
01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:03.960
um
but yeah those would be my only two

759
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.559
examples
um at least off the top of my head I'm

760
01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:11.520
sure if I like went through
my brain I would be able to think of

761
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.460
other ones
um

762
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.980
and of course neither of them are happy
I I'm sorry about that

763
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:25.500
um but yeah so those are the questions
you guys asked I hope my answers were

764
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.099
mostly satisfactory
um

765
01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:35.040
so yeah I will be back on Tuesday with
another podcast I have no idea what's

766
01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.700
going to be so wish me luck uh and then
after that I believe Nick will be uh

767
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.880
coming to visit
from his mom's place which is like four

768
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.819
hours away
and we'll be recording a bunch of

769
01:01:47.819 --> 01:01:54.180
podcasts for you guys
um until then again thank you guys all

770
01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.920

771
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.700
