from the padreon but not for us not for
us

5
00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.539
um we over the last couple of weeks
moved across the country as I believe we

6
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
talked about in the last one we were
talking about our pending anxieties

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.440
leading up to this yeah uh so we are now
in my new condo slash apartment it's

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.280
technically a condo but I'm renting it
so it's an apartment

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.980
um and Nick will be looking for a place
of their own soon

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.559

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
don't need to get into yeah
um but yeah

12
00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
stuff's going well uh YouTube's being a
bit of a dick as usual as normal later

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.020
um
a video trying to get some more patrons

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
as you guys know because I sent a poll
out to you thank you for replying to

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.659
that poll by the way what was the poll I
didn't see that it was basically which

17
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.420
of these topics do you want us to cover
right right that thing yes and so now we

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
have the the list of what's going to go
out and there'll be a video explaining

19
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.720
all of that and uh yeah that should be
out probably Friday okay

20
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
um so yeah
um and as of right now just a couple of

21
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
hours ago we released a video about how
Middle Earth has always kind of been

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.780
woke
um thank you for everyone who has

23
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.060
watched that and either agreed with us
or

24
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.700
um
presented your own rationale or

25
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.119
reasoning what was it like kindly
disagreed

26
00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.079
I forget the wording there isn't really
a phrasing for kindly disagreeing with

27
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.439
someone it's usually respectful disagree
respectfully disagreed okay

28
00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.700
um there have there have been very few
people who have been like jerks in the

29
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.960
comments so far so far
um have you gotten much have you gotten

30
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.000
much pushback about you know kind of our
take on Tolkien himself

31
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.959
ugly no no okay
I was expecting because that was the one

32
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.900
that I was kind of nervous going into
because it is

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.200
um I did write a lot of this video and
it either way it's

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.900
very white people talking about you know
racism and I I'm not entirely

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.680
comfortable with that and like like I
kind of wrote Into the video like I

36
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.160
didn't really want to completely
exonerate Tolkien

37
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.160
yeah um I I was expecting I am still in
I still am expecting some comments of

38
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.300
first details me that attack on Titan
isn't anti-semitic and now he's telling

39
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.519
me that Tolkien wasn't racist it's like
yes I'm secretly a white ring a white

40
00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.060
ring okay right right wing plant the
white Wings the white ring sounds like a

41
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.660
fantasy object it does or a fascist
group yeah speaking of fascists

42
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.080
um
a really fascists at all oh my God no no

43
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.560
speaking of fascists um you actually
don't know if you were up for this but

44
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.379
um I had my window open and
on the street below there was kind of a

45
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.640
rally and I was like okay is this a good
Rally or a bad rally because I heard

46
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.300
like someone on a megaphone like this a
good witch or a bad witch dropping

47
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.340
f-bombs to the crowd to a crowd to like
drivers by

48
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.459
um
and I was like okay generally speaking

49
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.360
you know rights protests don't involve
f-bombs dropped at crowds like you know

50
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.620
like yeah [ __ ] this and [ __ ] that like
so I looked outside and it's a bunch of

51
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.620
Canadian flags at the intersection and
there was a don't tread on me flag down

52
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.120
there oh God yeah so it was probably
another trucker thing

53
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.239
um

54
00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.019
movement here in Canada is primarily
based around truckers yeah I didn't have

55
00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.620
to deal with any of that where we lived
before and now we're in like a proper

56
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.940
City because truckers were so chill in
the maritimes

57
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.040
my microphone does not want to play nice
yeah it has to be tightened yeah

58
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040
severely

59
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.519
um okay yeah this is the first time
we've had the microphones like set up

60
00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.739
yeah
okay uh but yeah so today we're going to

61
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.540
talk about something that I've I've been
seeing a lot of discourse about online

62
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.380
and it does play into the Middle Earth
video

63
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.520
everybody comparing the rings of power
to the house of the dragon and a lot of

64
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
people not everyone but a lot of people
just kind of saying House of the Dragon

65
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.800
is better because it's darker yeah and
kind of asking the question

66
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.400
is you know Grim dark quote realistic
media better than

67
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.199
I guess Escapist media I I
because I I would classify rings of

68
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.919
power as Escapist because I like it's
not the best show in the world but I

69
00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.380
watch it as soon as it's available on
Amazon Prime because it watching it just

70
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.400
it makes me feel
it takes me out of everything

71
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.280
um whereas I haven't watched an episode
of House of the Dragon yet I've watched

72
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.699
some Recaps but I haven't watched an
episode because I'm like I can't deal

73
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.259
with the negativity right now touched on
this talking about Attack on Titan

74
00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.360
um a little bit
um

75
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.000
I wrote like the idea that people feel
that tragic Media or that depressing

76
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.039
Media or more anguishing media is more
quote authentic because

77
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.800
um I I feel like there's a lot of
emotional energy invested in these

78
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.360
characters and to watch you know these
invested motions basically end in dying

79
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.860
and sadness and yeah horrible things
happening I think that makes people want

80
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.639
to justify it like this this must be
realistic because it made me feel things

81
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.479
and I'm like well yeah like with House
of the Dragon the first episode a woman

82
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.300
is kind of yeah less dies in childbirth
and is more murdered in a child yeah and

83
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.039
and like in episode five I want to say
five it might have been sick the last

84
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:17.280
one yeah the the most recent one a gay
character is introduced and killed or it

85
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.039
might not have been the most recent one
what is today

86
00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.300
something like that but it was last week
it was last week's episode I think he'll

87
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.900
reason I'm divesting from a lot of media
and why oh and another I think another

88
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.960
pregnant woman died the most recent one
she's got lit up by by a dragon nice

89
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.220
um like I'm just I think the reason why
I'm having such a struggle finding a

90
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.060
niche for me or finding a place where
for me that I can enjoy is because so

91
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.419
much of it is taking a turn to this
obsessively depressing sort of uh angle

92
00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.080
like these these very errantly
pessimistic messages and the thing that

93
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.500
I don't like is that these pessimistic
messages are not being presented as ah

94
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.039
this is tragedy porn it's being
presented as this is realistic because

95
00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:05.220
it's depressing because it's tragic and
I I really and that's kind of

96
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.259
why I started to really get off Board of
House of House of dragons Game of

97
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.680
Thrones yeah and the the first the
actual Series Game of Thrones why I

98
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.520
really started to starting from like
season five onward started really not

99
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.300
enjoying myself while I was watching it
because it was kind of from yeah because

100
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.380
theme like it was just okay what's going
to happen now oh the good guys are gonna

101
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.740
lose shocker yeah for like season seven
and eight I would say I was watching it

102
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.900
more out of obligation yeah
um I Ramsay Bolton was kind of the first

103
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.039
time that was kind of the breaking point
for you for me like I the episode where

104
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:46.199
they actually won it felt so
unfulfilling because okay the bad guys

105
00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.099
win the bad guys win the bad guys win
the bad guys win until we need them to

106
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:54.780
not win to get this to get this moving
like and even it was like okay the bad

107
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.039
guy has lost and now we're going to have
Sansa have him eaten alive by his dogs

108
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:06.720
to just remove a bit of her Humanity
yeah at the same time time which is not

109
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.500
in the books yeah that's at least not
yet like that hasn't happened George RR

110
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.720
Martin did not write that yeah and it's
Sansa is not even like in the books this

111
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.000
is you know for the last decade
Sansa is not with Rems evolving yeah

112
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.819
it's a look-alike yeah it's I don't even
yeah I think she's her name is Jane

113
00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:30.900
um yeah I remember Jane it's been a long
time since I read dance of dragons

114
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.800
um
but yeah she's not even there but yeah

115
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.219
anyway Game of Thrones so like some
people have been asking me to do a Game

116
00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:42.080
of Thrones video in the comments of the
Middle Earth one I'm playing

117
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.820
I don't think I can do it I I like the
amount of emotional stamina I had to

118
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.320
psych myself up for to watch one of
those Game of Thrones episodes

119
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.860
um it was debilitating like I was not in
a good headspace like I think it was

120
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.740
putting me into a worse headspace
because I just had to you're like okay

121
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.060
it's time to watch Game of Thrones oh no
uh whereas before it was like oh my God

122
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.360
I need to know what happens next it was
like I know what's gonna happen next

123
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.620
because
going to be in pain yeah someone I like

124
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.339
is going to be in pain not just no he'll
be fine or we're gonna hit that peaking

125
00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:17.580
moment where the good guys are gonna get
a win because like I said we need to get

126
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.120
this plot moving yeah
um

127
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.300
and it just becomes pretty I mean that's
and honestly that happened with Attack

128
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.920
on Titan too I just got so frustrated
when it's like Game of Thrones like that

129
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.019
got really bad in the final season oh
especially like with

130
00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:39.000
why is didn't why are daenerys's dragons
suddenly so easy to kill when they have

131
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.959
been like impervious for the last six
seasons I went on shouting Rampages

132
00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:47.459
about that not at you but you were in
the vicinity oh many people did online

133
00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:52.560
it's like why are they suddenly so you
know like in Lindsay Ellis's video they

134
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.940
have the four to their fortification of
hummingbirds fortitude defining the

135
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.899
fortitude of hummingbirds because like
they can just get taken out with like a

136
00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:06.360
mean look yeah but not drogon drogon can
take anything but the other ones uh

137
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.779
visarion what are they there for why are
they here yeah it's like they were there

138
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:18.120
for Canon fodder basically to be like
ooh the stakes are rising I'm getting

139
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.920
more and more progressively upset with
this media that kind of presents tragedy

140
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.640
and presents pessimism and horrible
things happening this is why I haven't

141
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.100
watched invincible and while I would
refuse to like yeah I I I I can't handle

142
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.220
and people well people argue back and
they push back like no it's actually

143
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.060
really optimistic actually it's making
fun of that pessimism

144
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.140
um he's actually really conflicting I
don't care it's a father beating the son

145
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.620
out of its child how are we supposed to
watch that and not feel completely

146
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.300
disgusted by that yeah um instead
because [ __ ] Omni man decides to [ __ ]

147
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.360
off or whatever like we're supposed to
feel a sense of hope it's like how does

148
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.500
that change anything the bad guys still
beat the crap out of everything and the

149
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.100
only reason the good guys win is because
he decided not to yeah like that that's

150
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.959
not empowering that's also kind of found
myself other than Attack on Titan really

151
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:12.360
going toward more positive stuff lately
like like I said I haven't watched an

152
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.920
episode of House of the Dragon but I've
been I've watched uh rings of power each

153
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.420
episode twice at this point I think I
don't want it and yeah like movie wise

154
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:28.079
like there's movies coming out or that
I'm should be you know excited for like

155
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:33.779
Multiverse is madness it was like going
into that and it was like okay

156
00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:39.000
why is it that my favorite character who
has been set up as someone who has been

157
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.860
through it and came through the other
end suddenly the villain I'm not just a

158
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.019
villain she is a Monster yeah suddenly a
monstrous villain like the most evil

159
00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:53.399
villain the MCU yeah it's especially
apparent because like less sympathetic

160
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:56.940
than Thanos like absolutely because
Thanos had a reason for doing things

161
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.200
that the Thanos is right the [ __ ]
imperialist [ __ ] but like you know like

162
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.779
oh we have to just stop wearing like a
sailor today I'm angry sorry like is it

163
00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:11.220
okay to answer for a Padres like you
know like uh the whole like imperialist

164
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.760
message was which sounds like a good
idea in theory is like oh the problem

165
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.180
with resource management is population
control it's like no that's not the

166
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.959
solution yeah just snap your fingers to
create more resources dumbass not even

167
00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:25.800
that but like sort of the allegory of
the real world like we need to cut back

168
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.220
on our population to preserve resources
like that's exactly what the English

169
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.720
slot during the Irish Potato Famine but
it turns out that you can you know use

170
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.740
technology and use resources to
reallocate resources to make sure that

171
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.899
poor people have you know food accounted
foreign resources yeah if there is um if

172
00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:46.320
you know
famine strikes or whatever yeah um and

173
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.779
it wasn't until after the Potato Famine
that uh just technological advancement

174
00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:54.540
advancements advancements were made in
agriculture

175
00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.720
um that indicated that it was abundantly
possible to use technology to get more

176
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.459
yield out of a single field yeah and I
think it's very telling media wise that

177
00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:11.040
you know what is the kind of shocker
runaway success movies of this year one

178
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.320
of them is top gun Maverick which is not
depressing yeah it is the good guys win

179
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.880
and the other one is everything
everywhere all at once which is actively

180
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.839
going against the depression kind of
thing

181
00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:27.779
extended even say that include the
Batman in there

182
00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:31.320
um the ending of the Batman did that
come out this year yeah that wasn't last

183
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.440
that no that wasn't last year there's a
February this year it's been a hell of a

184
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.420
year Jack God it's been a long year
been a hell of a year Jack

185
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.440
um but no like the Batman once again it
was kind of like it fought against the

186
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.320
idea of the Batman as someone who
requires to work in the shadows and like

187
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.680
he starts the the movie starts and he's
like I am the shadows and at the end of

188
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.980
the movie that's true [ __ ] the Shadows
yeah that's true

189
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.700
and it did really well yeah it didn't do
as well as the Dark Knight movies but it

190
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.000
was also you know fighting against
theaters not being entirely open because

191
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.360
of the pandemic talking about that the
Dark Knight I wanted to mention that

192
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.600
earlier kind of I think it was The Dark
Knight that really started the gritty

193
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.160
equals real I disagree I disagree I
think the Dark Knight actually ends on a

194
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.860
very hopeful note
the trend but like pessimism but just

195
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.360
the concept of gritty equals more
realistic and then from that the green

196
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.500
is kind of cycled spiraled into
pessimism

197
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.660
yeah yeah I agree there because like the
Dark Knight was a pretty as far as comic

198
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.220
book movies superhero movies go pretty
realistic of how a Batman could exist in

199
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.660
the real world and a joker and stuff
like that two-faced not so much but

200
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.500
um the the Batman and the Joker the
first one Batman Begins like the

201
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.160
villains in that one I think I like them
too yeah like they Christopher Nolan

202
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.920
went out of his and his brother Jonathan
with Jonathan Nolan went out of their

203
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.880
way to figure out how could these
actually exist in the real world and I

204
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.600
believe David Esquire co-wrote the
screenplays and then goyer took that and

205
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.240
was like okay people want gritty realism
and then took that and added gritty

206
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:09.120
realism to Zack Snyder who Zack Snyder
wasn't really all about gritty realism

207
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.139
but he was about like violence and stuff
like that and then mushed them together

208
00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:19.019
and then it was like okay Superman is
just also tends to lean 911 times 100.

209
00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.100
Snyder also tends to lean towards those
very pessimistic endings

210
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.760
um like the sense of like oh you gotta
like using sucker punches the kind of

211
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.420
archetypical Zack Snyder yeah which I
think I feel that it is uh because

212
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.620
that's Zack Snyder completely off the
rails no guidelines that's a movie

213
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.880
created developed by him and his but the
owls of gahul that was based on the

214
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.000
property
I just find it hilarious that he made

215
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.800
that movie
[Laughter]

216
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.720
um
the CGI owls in slow motion fantastic

217
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.740
um with lightning bolts in the
foreground

218
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.180
um but no like you know like you have
the baby face baby girl whatever her

219
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.100
name was baby doll baby doll uh she
basically gets lobotomy so that one of

220
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.760
the girls can escape yeah and all the
other girls die

221
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.680
um because the
pivotally the um

222
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.880
the record player that was playing while
she was dancing fell off a table and

223
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.000
that distract and because her dancing is
just so hypnotic

224
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.680
um yeah they were hypnotizing caught out
of God that damn it that movie uh you

225
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.820
know what I would actually what and like
it's already been done

226
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.959
but you know what I would actually
really like to see Zack Snyder do V for

227
00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:39.680
Vendetta oh you can do it
if someone would tone back the

228
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.079
yeah
um but I'd love to see him do V for

229
00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:47.579
Vendetta because the first like the
actual movie of V for Vendetta is good

230
00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:51.720
but I don't think it has a real
directorial Flair

231
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.040
whereas I think he could give an act
like a real directorial Flair to it and

232
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.519
I think it could be like something
really cool yeah as long as he had an

233
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:05.360
editor and
and a cinematographer scaring scaring

234
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.160
scaring him away from the frames no from
the frame button also some frames could

235
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.400
be about to use green screens I would
appreciate that green screens are fine

236
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.380
if they're done properly
I always prefer a set oh I mean I do too

237
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.360
like even when we're when we're filming
like I prefer I like the way some of the

238
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.600
green screen stuff we shoot looks but
it's mostly just because the background

239
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.799
is what I would like with the stranger
things video

240
00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:36.179
like we couldn't have done those
practically yeah the hospital one we

241
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:39.240
could have if we could find a hospital
that would let us shoot in a hallway but

242
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.539
that's hard to do wouldn't have been
able to have the particle effects going

243
00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:46.200
in front of behind you
no so that's significant too like

244
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.679
whereas with well we could have the
green but I'm not that good of a compass

245
00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:55.980
the uh the first one the wall one that
one we struggled with that a lot yeah

246
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:01.200
um the moon one didn't look too bad yeah
yeah so like that video was a pain in

247
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.960
the ass I had to render it at full
almost uncompressed if you know video

248
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.080
codecs I had to render it out in prores
because

249
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.820
the the the
compositing with the green screen was so

250
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:21.360
finicky that rendering it out just as a
normal YouTube video

251
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.520
um which are about 10 gigabytes
rendering it out at that made it look

252
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:33.960
like [ __ ] I had to render it out at 600
gigabytes as a 600 gigabyte file

253
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.059
and then upload that to YouTube for
YouTube to compress it for it to not

254
00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:43.679
look like [ __ ] that was a pain in the
ass look at that but yeah like I I feel

255
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:46.620
like Zack slender has also kind of
really been pivotal in sort of

256
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.299
establishing the pessimistic downward
leaning mood of a lot of you know Cinema

257
00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:54.840
and entertainment these days which is
weird because when you watch interviews

258
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.059
with Zack Snyder he's doesn't come
across as a pessimistic person no he's

259
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.679
he's very fusing actually
um I know it's like he wants to make a

260
00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:08.039
movie about
The Fountainhead he's very libertarian

261
00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:11.640
but at the same time the things that he
does believe and perpetually seem

262
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.600
socialist some of them
yeah I don't know much about his tax

263
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.320
policy and like his you know like uh
Corporation corporate policy and stuff

264
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.660
but he seems to dislike it well he hates
corporations in general because they try

265
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.320
to control him it's not which might be
why he likes The Fountainhead because

266
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.220
the whole thing with The Fountainhead is
an artist trying to not be controlled by

267
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.120
a corporation yeah and so if you look at
The Fountainhead that way and this is

268
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.320
the unfortunate thing about like a lot
of Libertarians is that some a lot of

269
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.580
people say they're libertarian uh
because they think people should be free

270
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.840
of Institutions and you know
institutional regulation and stuff

271
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.660
um the institution should not control
individuals whereas like I don't think

272
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.140
that necessarily is incompatible with
socialism and Democratic socialism

273
00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:01.200
institutions are exist to control bodies
um of finances not necessarily

274
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.900
individuals and I feel like there's sort
of a disconnect there it's like yeah

275
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.340
people should be free people should have
freedoms but you know the double-edged

276
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.840
sword thing about libertarianism is that
a lot of them believe in the don't tread

277
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.200
on me kind of policy where it's like no
I don't I should be allowed to say and

278
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.860
do whatever I want without any
repercussions yeah like I don't want to

279
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.400
not just be controlled by institutions I
don't want social bodies to control me

280
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.980
either I don't want other individuals to
control me either I'm like well I'm

281
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.520
sorry but that's just an element that
you can't yell fire in a crowded theater

282
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.240
yeah yeah
um and like in Canada right now there's

283
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.660
a big kerfuffle going on with
um

284
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.919
the Canadian government which is you
know Canada is technically a Democratic

285
00:20:40.919 --> 00:20:45.799
Socialist country
um but the government the progressive

286
00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:51.179
parties of the government are right now
trying to make it so that Canadian

287
00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:55.919
content creators for things like Netflix
and YouTube and even Twitter and

288
00:20:55.919 --> 00:21:02.820
Facebook and Instagram will be forced to
put Canadian content into their videos

289
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.440
their photos
yeah let me explain this

290
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.600
um will be forced to put Canadian
content in it or else they will not be

291
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.400
shareable
within Canada I think they're not very

292
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.960
clear of a of us that it won't be shared
in Canada that it won't be shared

293
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.280
elsewhere that the host will get a fine
yeah that the host like YouTube would

294
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.900
get a fine and it's like
how do you what are you trying to do I

295
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.020
mean I know why they're doing it they're
doing it because Legacy Media in Canada

296
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.600
is really dominated by one company and
that one company real has has to follow

297
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.860
the the
um Heritage the Heritage law acts the

298
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.000
Heritage Act laws in Canada which say
like if you're making a Canadian movie

299
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.659
and you get funding from the Canadian
government you have and tax breaks and

300
00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:55.260
stuff you have to have a beaver you have
to have a moose saloon whatever and

301
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.620
there's a literal checklist there is a
literal check not necessarily they show

302
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:05.100
it to you yeah uh Beaver is on there
um oh yeah I'm not kidding I thought

303
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.860
that the beaver was an exaggeration I
knew there was a certain quote of like

304
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.000
you know you don't have to show a beaver
it's one of several things that you can

305
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.140
show oh okay
um but um

306
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.539
yeah and so the government so this giant
Corporation in Canada Bell Media is

307
00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:27.240
trying to get the government to enforce
that law onto things like Netflix and

308
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.860
YouTube because they don't like having
to compete with places and creators that

309
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.000
don't have to do that but and so the
government's like okay we'll we'll do

310
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.919
that then but they're not taking into
account that okay if you do that to say

311
00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:45.360
you YouTube creators
the reason you're doing that for Belle

312
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.679
is because Bell wants tax breaks to
create this media and Bell wants you to

313
00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:54.000
finance this media are you going to like
is the Canadian government going to pay

314
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.159
us to make videos with some Maple Leafs
in them no but they want to pass a law

315
00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:04.500
doing it which as far as I'm concerned
is that's scarily totalitarianism yeah

316
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.919
it's the government deciding what Canon
cannot be propagated by the public yeah

317
00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:11.760
and it's like oh well we won't find
people we'll find YouTube and it's like

318
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.299
okay well then YouTube's not going to
promote anyone from Canada yeah and so

319
00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:19.200
everyone in Canada is going to have to
get a VPN and be like I'm actually in

320
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.100
Virginia yeah

321
00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:28.380
maybe I should do that anyway
but um yeah I I when it comes to the

322
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.919
topic of pessimism and media and kind of
this really growing Trend like that is

323
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:35.520
perpetuated and has the dragon is like
it's gritty because there is a guy who

324
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.919
has to saw a baby out of his wife uh no
that doesn't happen I thought he had to

325
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.100
sort of like basically no he decides
that his wife should die and then they

326
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.700
have to kill her to get the baby out Oh
I thought that he himself kind of no he

327
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.179
makes the decision he doesn't do it okay
I heard that he did it himself and it

328
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:55.080
was really gratuitously uh disgusting
apparently it is gratuitously disgusting

329
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.799
but he's like
doing something else but yeah like in

330
00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:02.580
terms of the gratuity it it feels
disingenuous it feels like you're being

331
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.059
pessimistic for the sake of being
pessimistic for the sake of saying that

332
00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:09.299
you're realistic or it's like not
everything is terrible like you know

333
00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:11.520
talking about everything everywhere all
at once it's about a woman who's

334
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.280
overcoming a midlife crisis
um and accepting that the life she has

335
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.039
is actually the life she's happy with
yeah

336
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:24.419
yes like that yeah that's exactly and
not in a like depressing way like well

337
00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.520
you know what could it be better no she
actually sees the better the quote

338
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.419
better versions of her life and she's
like you know what I actually prefer

339
00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:36.960
this yeah yeah she she goes through all
the different you know variants of

340
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.640
herself across all the different skills
and careers and story spoilers but

341
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.820
um if you haven't seen it yet yeah
what's wrong with you ghosts

342
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.020
you know like or it's streamable all the
other lives she chose kind of suck and

343
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.700
then this one life that she chose she
decided she wants to have this yeah

344
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.159
um
specifically kind of because of her

345
00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:02.280
daughter yeah exclusively because yeah
we shouldn't talk about it too much

346
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.039
because there's supposed to be a video
about this yeah

347
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:08.100
um I just love that movie so much and
you know like movies are leaning more

348
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.700
and more um but like you said the the
Batman

349
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.440
has a very uplifting thing where it's
like yeah Batman actually isn't the

350
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.960
darkness yeah Batman is
kind of he's you know there's a reason

351
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.440
at the end of the movie they showed the
bat signal because Batman is kind of the

352
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.480
light in Gotham's Darkness yeah
um sort of saying like you know if Bruce

353
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.360
Bruce Wayne is constantly reflect in
that movie he's constantly comparing

354
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.900
himself against Gotham Gotham is almost
a character and is foiled against Bruce

355
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.580
Wayne and uh Bruce sort of realizes that
the manifestation of Gotham that exists

356
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.220
is the manifestation of his own mind
yeah

357
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.539
um and that you know it's he can choose
how Gotham is going to manifest which

358
00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:52.320
means he can choose how he is going to
exist

359
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.419
um and he own that I don't know if you
do actually I think I do

360
00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:02.100
anyway yeah I'm just I'm like I want to
watch that

361
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.400
I I did get really really sick of
everything men dating sort of a

362
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.580
pessimistic sort of downturn sort of
attitude on the because who wants to be

363
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.600
reminded that life is suffering well
yeah like there are there's a place for

364
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.260
that like there are plenty of movies and
TV shows and stuff like that where it's

365
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.500
like yes sometimes life [ __ ] sucks
like Shameless has a good I think has a

366
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.960
good balance of you know the Lighter
Side of Life friends and family and

367
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.880
stuff like that and also when stuff is
just [ __ ] and I think it has a good

368
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.260
balance of that and that's like if you
want to be realistic you do need that

369
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.240
balance but then with like House of the
Dragon there doesn't seem to be a

370
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.340
balance it's just like this is dark and
horrible and gritty and life is bad and

371
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:59.880
it's that sort of
essentialism that I really hate the kind

372
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.279
of idea that this is dark
and life is dark so this is realistic

373
00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:11.640
yeah and it's like but life isn't all
dark yeah is the thing like

374
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.140
and even if it is why is that the only
media that you would want to consume if

375
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.559
your life is all Darkness it's like and
using Shameless as an example there are

376
00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:22.620
times unshameless where you know you've
got this family who are dealing with

377
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.460
addiction problems who are dealing with
uh parental abuse who are dealing with

378
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:32.220
poverty but they have moments of levity
that you're like yeah this feels real

379
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:39.120
because you know it's it
even the worst of times there is

380
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.500
something that will make you laugh and
and like talking about Shameless kind of

381
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.220
relating that to the video we will talk
about Shameless in the young we we only

382
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.799
called we don't actually call the videos
by their names we call them by the media

383
00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:54.299
they cover so yeah it's the young Royals
video yeah um for that like and that's

384
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:58.140
kind of something that I I generally
liked young Royals but like the thing

385
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.799
well you know I think you only watch two
episodes of young Royals I missed the

386
00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:07.020
last two watched everyone okay
um like the thing that I didn't like

387
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:12.240
about that show is that it was leaning
towards that pessimism yeah

388
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.460
um it was like oh he's a prince but it
sucks yeah

389
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:22.740
everything sucks everything's bad oh my
God boy problems Royals problems money

390
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.580
problems it's it's just like everything
and there there wasn't you know even

391
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.700
when he was kind of it was a really
funny scene when he was completely high

392
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.679
off his ass and stuff uh I think he was
just drunk no he took some pills already

393
00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:39.720
took pills I don't count pills
pills aren't drugs like he was kind of

394
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.679
he was going through it and even that
was kind of like I feel so bad for this

395
00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:48.059
kid yeah
I felt bad for Simone I didn't care if I

396
00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:52.919
didn't feel bad for Wilhelm at all
I felt bad that Simone was being put

397
00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:58.020
through that yes because I have been
there before well specifically dealing

398
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.120
with the drunk person yeah that's
completely off their ass

399
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.900
I don't think I will tolerate a version
of that show where they end up happily

400
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:13.100
together because I'm like I have heard
from multiple pores what it's like

401
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.279
dating a rich person and one person I
follow on Twitter

402
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:20.399
um I'm not going to say their handle
because they're wonderful and they do

403
00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:25.380
get some flame Flack from time to time
but um they said that they were dating

404
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:31.620
someone in the UK when they were living
there uh their marine biologists and um

405
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.799
they were dating a very rich person and
this rich person asked them what's your

406
00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:38.820
favorite cheese and he was like or they
were like

407
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.220
um I don't know cheddar and this rich
guy was completely offended

408
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.460
um whereas like I don't I don't know
what you're talking about when you find

409
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.059
a very nicely aged cheddar there's
nothing better oh there's there's a lot

410
00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:55.679
of lists like listical things online
that are like

411
00:29:55.679 --> 00:30:00.659
um you know the reality of a poor dating
a rich and stuff like that and it's like

412
00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:06.419
I knew I was dating someone from a
different economic

413
00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:12.120
like thing when we were going to go for
groceries we had moved in together and

414
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.419
we were going for groceries the first
time and they were just ready to leave

415
00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:19.860
and they weren't looking for sales
yeah like they weren't looking for

416
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.500
coupons or anything like that
um another one was I knew I was dating

417
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.500
someone of a different Echo a different
class

418
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.279
um
when they asked me if I wanted to go on

419
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:38.880
vacation
and I started talking about you know how

420
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.919
to plan it and they said oh no I meant
next week

421
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.539
and it's like or go on a trip oh wow
and it was like okay I need six months

422
00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:51.600
to plan this I need to get my time off
and they were like no no I just mean

423
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.320
next week we can go to wherever I forget
where it was it wasn't like anywhere

424
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.700
like like super expensive or anything it
was like Cuba or something like that but

425
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.779
like yeah and so that's what I mean like
in terms of like Simone and Wilhelm

426
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:07.679
dating either
and this is what I mean about like

427
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:10.380
getting really frustrated with the
emotional support boards and I was I

428
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.919
wasn't that fond of the creator of the
show actually re putting that on

429
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:18.480
Instagram like you know they
link to the video on their Instagram I

430
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.159
think it was their Instagram right yes
um I can't remember whether it was a man

431
00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:31.140
or woman or in between but uh oh a woman
um it's uh sir and or Norm Adam um

432
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:36.240
person uh person yeah they put it on
Instagram and we're like is is Simone an

433
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.299
emotional support poor and like fans of
the show we're like oh my God how dare

434
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:42.600
they and I'm like
look at the trope

435
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.960
as it manifests infection we're not
moralizing the show based on this but

436
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.980
also look at how this would affect the
relationship Dynamic Beyond just a

437
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.640
fantasy
um and it's very much like okay think

438
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.140
about it like there is very Two Worlds
colliding here yes that's the reality of

439
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.020
the
um class Gap classism still exists

440
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.919
classes still exist I don't care what
anyone says but like thinking about what

441
00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:07.799
other people had said about their
experiences about order the poor is

442
00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:13.740
saying dating riches uh it's literally
two different worlds yeah and so I'm

443
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.440
like the only either Simone is going to
get burnt out so hard from being in this

444
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.399
kind of toxic situation yeah like Samoa
is never going to be a prince yeah

445
00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:27.179
um from either or being being burnt out
from you know dating this guy who is

446
00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:31.679
completely rich and or he is going to
himself move up in social classes I

447
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:38.159
think the only way for them to end up
together is if Wilhelm abdicated yeah

448
00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.100
um and that
that but again which I could see

449
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:46.080
happening on the show yeah yeah and that
seems to be uh at least an possible

450
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.140
direction for the show yeah but at the
same time because royalty and Sweden do

451
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.220
do need to have jobs and stuff so it
would just be okay I can't be king

452
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.260
but I can I'm still gonna have the
benefits work for a hedge fund yeah

453
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.500
like I still have that name and that's
the thing

454
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.500
the thing well and this is what rich
people don't understand you will always

455
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.980
be a rich when you have when you are the
kind of person who has Holdings and

456
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:12.899
titles there is no instance where you
are going to need to be poor

457
00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:16.500
um and that's kind of what I I didn't
like that the show we're talking about

458
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.140
getting Royals know apparently um I
didn't like that all right there's

459
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.080
another thing I want to talk about too I
didn't like the show didn't really

460
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.740
investigate Augustus uh August
um well I think they're going to like

461
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.760
him being a rich who does actually lose
everything but doesn't want well loses

462
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.960
his cash but owns stuff but doesn't want
to sell it and sort of say like what

463
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.740
does it mean for for a rich person to
quote unquote lose everything yeah

464
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.539
because I have in my family someone who
works very high up in a bank yeah he's

465
00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:49.440
he's very high up
um and during the 2008 stock crash he

466
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.940
quote unquote lost everything and my mom
was yeah oh my my grandmother's culture

467
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.559
is like oh your uncle person uh has lost
everything in the stock crash and was

468
00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:02.399
like oh my god do they have the house
well yeah we have the cars yes do they

469
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:05.700
have the retirement well yes
um it's like well what the [ __ ] they

470
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.820
lose then yes and that's the thing is
like what do these people people

471
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.619
consider quote unquote losing because I
remember in I was oh how old was I it

472
00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:20.099
was just it was before Elementary School
um so I think I was about four my dad

473
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:23.339
had already been injured uh he was a
mechanic and he'd already been injured

474
00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:26.820
but he got like double injured he had I
think

475
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:33.599
he broke his neck before I was born and
this he broke his back and poor guy he

476
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:37.740
couldn't work anymore obviously
and for years and years the disability

477
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:42.060
claims and everything he didn't get paid
out his disability for 12 years after

478
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.240
that so just to put that into
perspective but

479
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.700
us losing everything we were homeless we
had to move in with my grandparents and

480
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.320
my mom had to sleep on the couch and my
dad slept on the floor and they did that

481
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.640
so that I could have the guest bedroom
yeah and like and it's like that was us

482
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.740
losing everything luckily I do have
my mom was always very smart in the

483
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.540
sense that she was she's very Thrifty uh
I think my dad slept on the couch my mom

484
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.740
on the floor anyway well if he broke his
back I hope that he yeah yeah my mother

485
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.060
wouldn't be like get on the floor

486
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.660
like my mom quote unquote losing
everything

487
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.500
um
you know moving into a tiny apartment

488
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.880
um it was calling her her parents who
you know were never particularly rich

489
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.700
but you know they're probably they
probably fit into a middle to upper

490
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.780
middle class yeah
um calling her up and saying I have Mom

491
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.320
I have no money and then my grandmother
on top of a guilt trip I mean I count

492
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.060
anyone who owns a house is Rich yeah

493
00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:51.660
taking my mom out to a bulk food store
and buying two months worth of noodles

494
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.000
and pasta and just eating nothing but
spaghetti for two months yeah

495
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.280
um
and so like I was I remember doing that

496
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.740
when
um I was I was about 13 or 14 and my dad

497
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:13.140
moved out and
my mother was so ashamed that she had to

498
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.540
go to a food bank and I was actually I
was fine for two for about two or three

499
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.040
months
all I ate was chicken noodle soup but

500
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.940
not Campbell's chicken noodle soup the
no-name chicken noodle soup

501
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:32.640
um okay so fun story so uh my school had
a food drive uh when I was like

502
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.619
six five yeah uh back when we were
living in Toronto actually

503
00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:42.780
um and you were living on the east side
of Toronto yes Scarborough uh near the

504
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.540
Scarborough Bluffs
I would like to go out there sometime to

505
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.280
sort of revisit old stomping around see
if I can recognize anything but um so my

506
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.820
full school at a food drive and I was
like Mom Mom we need to give to give

507
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.180
food to the food bank because poor
people have less than us and they need

508
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.099
food so my mom didn't tell me this until
much later but we actually donated some

509
00:37:02.099 --> 00:37:06.119
of the food that she had gotten
some of the food you get is pretty

510
00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:09.480
shitty so I can see giving it back oh
apparently sometimes it isn't and they

511
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.880
have food banks in BC have this problem
all the time like they will get like

512
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.440
bulk bags of quinoa and like super
classy food and it's like they it ends

513
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.160
up going bad because poor people on a
poor spectrum of uh wage don't know how

514
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.920
to cook it they don't know what to do
with it they don't know how to season it

515
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.460
because it's not something to grow up
around it and so they have sort of made

516
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:34.740
more specific lists about like okay
please do not give these Foods yeah I

517
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.700
know they're super foods and you think
you're helping poor people but you're

518
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.480
not yeah
um when you know once again that is a

519
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.940
complete disconnect of classism yeah
like once again time but it's like I I

520
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:53.640
when I got my first like job out of um
Business School uh and I was I was

521
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.280
making
at the time I think it was about a

522
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.420
thousand dollars every two weeks which
to me was like I'm rich yeah

523
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.880
um I donated I went to a food bank and
basically said like what do you guys

524
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.359
need and they gave me a list and it was
stuff like

525
00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:14.040
uh butter canned goods craft dinner
things like that and I just went and got

526
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.420
like 200 worth of stuff and brought it
to them because I was like I've got

527
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.560
money I should give back now and you
know

528
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.660
looking back it's like I could barely
afford rent but I was like thousand

529
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:34.380
dollars every two weeks a quadruple like
digit paycheck like I thought I was just

530
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.520
like the richest person in the world
um and once again like that's what I

531
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.359
kind of mean like young Royals has the
in spite of the fact that there's these

532
00:38:42.359 --> 00:38:45.720
very weird social Dynamic going on
between the two main characters where I

533
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.300
think that I would only really be
satisfied with a series of Simone ends

534
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.720
up saying like I can't do this well
either Simone says I can't do this which

535
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.640
he kind of did at the end of season one
uh I I will I I think the only real

536
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:03.660
ending like I said would be for
um uh Wilhelm to abdicate yeah

537
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:08.280
um and but not get to the like don't
flash forward and show them happy with

538
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.540
kids or anything just have him abdicate
so that he can be with Samoa and then

539
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.200
you know that's where the show ends yeah
so it ends on a happily ever after but

540
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.040
we don't see the Ever After yeah
um I think that'll be fine but once

541
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.920
again like I said will Wilhelm comes
from a different world and that would to

542
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.339
burn some of it out eventually unless
the moment does kind of succumb to like

543
00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:28.859
comfort and wealth and stuff but it
doesn't really seem like that's in his

544
00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:31.980
character but that's what I mean a
happily ever after you never see the

545
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.760
Ever After that's true um How does it go
um

546
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.619
a comedy ends with a marriage in the
Fifth Act a tragedy and happen a comedy

547
00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:43.380
has the marriage in the Fifth Act a
tragedy has the marriage in the second

548
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:50.040
act yeah uh but yeah so like young but
another example of the of the actual

549
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.220
topic
um which is like the dark dark and

550
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.440
realistic gritty versus you know
something else is

551
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.300
um the new version of Queer as Folk
which just got canceled and it got

552
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.660
canceled because it was on peacock and
nobody has peacock and peacock didn't

553
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:11.640
really tell anyone the show existed
um but the show itself

554
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.619
was dark it dealt with drug abuse it
dealt with uh Financial issues it dealt

555
00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:20.520
with HIV and AIDS it dealt with
um

556
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.480
um well it basically recreated the pulse
Massacre

557
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.220
um a gay nightclub being shot up heavy
[ __ ] that's very heavy [ __ ] and people

558
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.579
were you know very happy about it about
the show because they were like you know

559
00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:37.260
there's people of color there's trans
representation like this is great but it

560
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.880
got canceled and it didn't hit a wide
audience because I think you know even

561
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.060
the audience that knew it existed
probably might have watched the first

562
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.540
episode and was like I can't I can't
with the because the first episode ends

563
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.260
with the shooting yeah
whereas Heart Stopper

564
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.359
is you know a cast with lots of people
of color with trans characters you know

565
00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:03.780
the same kind of checklist but it's all
happy yeah and that is a huge success

566
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.540
for Netflix that's what I was saying
about like young Royals like it doesn't

567
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.960
need to be all happy I mean like there
is a lot of emotional stuff going on

568
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.560
like his brother dies
um yes it does suck suck to happen yeah

569
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.280
so does a heart stop or like there's
there's stuff covering that with eating

570
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.700
disorders and problems coming out the
thing about like this pessimism and why

571
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.520
I think Young Royals kind of fits into
it is because there wasn't enough you're

572
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.780
just on a young Royals kick I was trying
to get off of it and like

573
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.440
there there wasn't an opportunity I
started this talking about Lord of the

574
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.380
Rings generally like and I'm trying to
apply this to a general sense of like

575
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.280
this kind of pessimism of that [ __ ] is
that there I don't think Young Royals is

576
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.740
pessimistic though the tone was just
always so serious that's not I don't

577
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.640
think it was it was Teen drama that's
every teen drama

578
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.520
killed the crack of joke once in a while
no one like they did it was just in

579
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:57.560
Swedish
so we didn't get the the comedy

580
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.140
part of like being team drama but once
again like Heart Stopper didn't really

581
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.140
fit into this like Heart Stopper was
more light-hearted like there are but

582
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:12.240
Heart Stopper is not a drama I guess it
has it it has it covers things that are

583
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.359
dramatic but it's really more of a
comedy like I'm having a proper gay

584
00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:21.660
Panic yeah
um but like it's more it's more

585
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.380
comparing it to Sex In The City is weird
but like sex in the city had dramatic

586
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.220
things happen you know like Charlotte
loses her baby like things like that

587
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.180
topic like once again like oh it can't
have like you know slapstick comedy

588
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.300
because it's a drama is that not getting
back into like the obsession with

589
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:42.480
pessimism like real life doesn't befit
there are genres Nick sure there are

590
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.980
things like sex in the city and like
Shameless that do have like little

591
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:52.740
Shameless literally had slapstick comedy
with Mickey being chased by this crazy

592
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:58.319
she was um one of the Gallagher she was
like distantly forget her name no not

593
00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:03.480
anyway uh half sister or something like
that and being shot in the ass by her

594
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.140
yeah
um so like literally slapstick comedy at

595
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.800
the same time as you're dealing in the
same show and in the same season

596
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.819
probably that you're dealing with
somebody with mental health issues that

597
00:43:14.819 --> 00:43:19.740
you're dealing with children being taken
away by children drama or a comedy well

598
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.720
it's that's the thing it's classified as
a drama but it has that comedy I kind of

599
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.440
I it's a dramedy as far as I'm concerned
Shameless is

600
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.579
um and there are like things like sex in
the city that are comedies first and

601
00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:37.560
foremost that do have dramatic things
like Charlotte losing her baby like

602
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.819
um Samantha dealing with cancer uh
things like having

603
00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:45.000
um you know the discussion about
abortion and are you ready to have a

604
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.440
child and do you want a child and stuff
like that having serious discussions but

605
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:55.380
at the same time being a a a comedy
first and foremost and I do think that

606
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.280
but that's what I mean like does like
going back to like House of dragon does

607
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:04.200
its classification as a political drama
automatically facilitate that it cannot

608
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:09.180
be that there can be no element of hope
no one I mean there are there might be

609
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.980
levity and funny stuff that happens in
it there was in Game of Thrones oh yeah

610
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.760
um but like I haven't watched it and the
things that people talk about in like

611
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.380
the reviews and the Recaps and stuff
like that is just the and then he gets

612
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:28.200
his head beaten in because he's gay yeah
and stuff like that and so it's like the

613
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.680
people aren't talking about the funny
stuff whereas with Game of Thrones

614
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.940
people did talk about Tyrion and Varys
yeah you know they're snarky bitching

615
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.819
back and forth and stuff like that like
there were times where the audience

616
00:44:38.819 --> 00:44:42.900
could feel comfortable with what was
going on uh where you could kind of

617
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.040
relax for a minute yeah whereas like I
feel like growing the trend uh there is

618
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.760
this growing Trend among dramas uh
specifically things that we have to be

619
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.099
dramatic because we're dramas and it's
like it's this these framing devices not

620
00:44:56.099 --> 00:44:58.980
necessarily script or like you know like
classifications but these framing

621
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.599
devices to make you feel like everything
is so heavy all the time yeah but

622
00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:08.220
everything going on is just the worst
yeah

623
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.920
um and that's what I was trying to talk
about with young Royals is that they're

624
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.119
like given the young Royals isn't like
that it was for me

625
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:18.839
because of the framing the music the way
things were shot the dark the tangenting

626
00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:22.980
toward darkness and Dark Shadows are in
like the way things were if young Royals

627
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.599
was a was just dark and depressing and
gritty the entire time I don't think it

628
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:32.420
would have built up the type of fan base
that it has

629
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.880
I did feel that it was sort of
excessively dark and there weren't

630
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.060
really opportunities sort of taken to
sort of like let's have teenagers being

631
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.000
teenagers instead of framing everything
as being the worst thing in the world

632
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.599
everything wasn't framed as being the
worst thing in the world it was

633
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:51.720
teenagers being teenagers but it was
commenting on the you know the wealth

634
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.280
Gap and stuff like that and so it's not
just going it's not going to have like

635
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.940
Looney Tunes comedy in there I know
you're not talking about Looney Tunes

636
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.240
comedy and I I hate when we get into
these these arguments over something

637
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:10.260
because I I've don't see young Royals as
being depressing

638
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.180
okay I guess that's fine like maybe like
I was talking about like it's not House

639
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:20.400
of the Dragon like you're right about
that that's what I mean like things

640
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.160
don't need to be how's the dragon to
kind of fit into this pessimism

641
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.240
Obsession like it can be something like
just framing everything as I hate using

642
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.160
the trades heavy but like it is this
sorry excuse me this emotional weight

643
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.300
that's kind of going like oh what's
gonna happen next oh my God I guess let

644
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.180
me I bet the main characters are gonna
have something bad happen to them like

645
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.780
that just constant looming expectation
of like bad things are going to happen

646
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.560
and I think you know whether that's
young Royals or whether that's you know

647
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.240
whatever kind of media I think that has
permeated because even watching even

648
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.900
talking about like I didn't watch I read
Heartbreaker before I watched Heart

649
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.160
Stopper before I I read it before I
watched it and reading it there were

650
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.960
times where I was like oh God
shit's gonna go down bad thing is gonna

651
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.200
happen someone's gonna get beaten
someone's gonna be someone's gonna get

652
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.619
disowned and be homeless and then it
didn't happen that's very nice when that

653
00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:15.839
happens I love that one yeah and it's
like this wash of relief but I was so I

654
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:21.180
am so programmed to expect it yeah
um that there's constant like oh and

655
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:26.099
like even The Sopranos had funny stuff
the Russian running through the the Pine

656
00:47:26.099 --> 00:47:32.060
Barrens was hilarious
[Laughter]

657
00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:37.560
and just like some of the Sass from
Carmella and stuff like this like queers

658
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.819
folk had a lot of comedy in it
um vid queers spoke the new series

659
00:47:41.819 --> 00:47:49.020
Breaking Bad had hilarious things
actually has a lot of that I I can

660
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.740
imagine because I forget the lead
actor's name but Saul he is a comedian

661
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:58.020
yeah who just accidentally got into this
really dramatic role

662
00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.960
um but you know like unless I mean like
that's what I mean by a lot of this

663
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.260
isn't necessarily the script or what's
going on it's about Framing and

664
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.440
portrayal yeah it's about sort of the
having these characters that frame

665
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.760
things optimistically like Tyrion did
before he actually went to esos

666
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.000
um yeah
um he kind of had this Devil May care

667
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.920
attitude uh
um just like yeah oh yeah like a brain

668
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.760
needs books like a sword needs a wet
stuff like and the way that he kind of

669
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.240
um would be like yes I am not the
perfect person for this world but I'm

670
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.359
gonna make the best of it yeah the thing
the most Korean thing I think ever

671
00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:35.400
happened was kind of
um auctioning off his nieces and nephews

672
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.440
to different hypothetical marriages oh
yeah I've run to different people to see

673
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:45.960
who would leak information to a sister
yeah and see who he couldn't trust yeah

674
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.839
um and like which Cersei did later
hmm

675
00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:55.920
she kind of pulled the same truth not
with the auctioning off but kind of did

676
00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.400
the same trick later yeah yeah and like
sort of having that kind of those kinds

677
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.920
of attitudes and that wasn't framed as
like

678
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.060
I'm auctioning off like I said in
framing it's like I'm auctioning off my

679
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.339
nieces and nephews to see who will stab
me in the back he was like you know I

680
00:49:11.339 --> 00:49:15.660
want to know who's I'm surrounded by a
bunch of liars I'm subverted by a bunch

681
00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:19.260
of liars I want to know who I can expect
to tell what to who yeah um and it was

682
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.700
and that's what I mean by Framing like
it wasn't framed as like with a heavy

683
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:30.960
heart I must do this it was like very
flippant it was so yeah I think I

684
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:35.099
right it was in the interview questions
that I sort of sort of said that that um

685
00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:40.920
or sort of suggested for you to say that
that Framing and tone and you know yeah

686
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.579
that's important yeah those I think
those are more important than written

687
00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:48.119
words and what I'm getting like I said I
haven't watched House of the Dragon I

688
00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:51.839
might watch it when the season is over I
might not depends on my head space at

689
00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:55.740
the time right now I can't go into
something Grim dark yeah

690
00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.760
um which I'm getting my fantasy fix from
rings of power which like I said isn't

691
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.839
the best show but just being there and
be like there is you know a building

692
00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:08.099
darkness and stuff because of course it
is it's a fantasy show but there's like

693
00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:11.940
you know you're not kids aren't getting
their heads lopped off no one's getting

694
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.460
their head beaten in Lord of the Rings
from the movies at least we're always

695
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.300
about you know like there is light in
the darkness and you have to exactly the

696
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.780
light out in the darkness and like even
with Game of Thrones there was always

697
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.980
that hope of you know
the happy ending there was always the

698
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:30.540
hope of Daenerys getting on the throne
of and fixing the monarchy ending

699
00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.660
because stuff like that there was always
that hope

700
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:38.099
um but with House of the Dragon
I know it doesn't end well for the

701
00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:43.500
targaryens I Know It Ends horribly for
the whole line including Daenerys so

702
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.359
they're no matter what you do this shows
will always be dark it's a bleakness

703
00:50:48.359 --> 00:50:52.680
yeah because I know how this ends yeah
you have shown me how this is and like I

704
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.059
do want to make a video about cyberpunk
and Edge Runners but like Edge writers

705
00:50:57.059 --> 00:51:00.839
I'm also getting the feeling that it is
also just going to be gratuitously Bleak

706
00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:06.240
just like and when I say gratuitously
Bleak I I I feel like it's becoming

707
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.040
almost like a a Trope or a literary
device it's like we're going to use

708
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.559
gratuitous bleakness to convey messaging
to our audience about bleakness and I I

709
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:21.240
feel like it's a messaging or a Trope or
a device that doesn't actually

710
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.040
accomplish anything because it's
nihilism it's saying life is Bleak deal

711
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.040
with it what should we do with it well
acknowledge that life is weakness and

712
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.559
it's like okay but what should we do
about that well life is Bleak nothing we

713
00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:36.540
can do about it yeah and like I'm I am
getting so sick of that yeah I am

714
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.599
getting so sick of that
um

715
00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:44.700
and I don't really care that sort of you
know like things like uh Invincible

716
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.359
um have like kind of counter programming
and subtext and like you know there's

717
00:51:48.359 --> 00:51:51.540
actually hope after all it's like yeah
but he kills the entire Justice League

718
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.900
analog and beats the crap out of his son
to the point where he's losing all of

719
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.740
his teeth yeah
um everything's bloody people die people

720
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.319
die people die people die and this is
this is like I think

721
00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:09.000
this will be a good way to wrap this up
um

722
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.160
and kind of bring it into the next video
that's one of the reasons I like

723
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.260
slasher movies so much
because no matter what at the end of the

724
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:24.480
slasher movie
you know there will be a final girl

725
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.260
there is light at the end of the tunnel
the bad guy will lose there are horror

726
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.880
movies where that doesn't happen where
you know just [ __ ] sucks and bad [ __ ]

727
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.440
like like hereditary hereditary does not
have a happy ending but like they're

728
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.660
most horror movies do have or saw for
instance but most horror movies do have

729
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:47.040
the Villa the the killer is killed in
the end and you know like scream is a

730
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.740
good example where literally the end of
Scream the killers are killed and the

731
00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.800
sun is rising
um the night is over and the sun is

732
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.660
rising it's okay now
um and that's why like the screen movies

733
00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:01.859
are some of my favorite movies because
you do one they are you know dramatic

734
00:53:01.859 --> 00:53:06.720
and gory but they're also hilarious and
you do have that kind of upbeat ending

735
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:13.260
even in this genre that is built around
tragedy you do have an upbeat ending

736
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.220
um
and I'm really excited to do the the new

737
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:22.319
horror video for October about that
because I get to talk about things like

738
00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:28.559
the new Chucky series and which is like
it's a horror series that's really funny

739
00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:31.559
and

740
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.780
is like not only being like Oh there's
hope at the end of the tunnel but it's

741
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:41.760
got like a gay teenage love story that
everyone is like this is the normal

742
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.160
thing the homophobe's the [ __ ] yeah
yeah like the killer doll is more in

743
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.440
favor of this than the dad I'm a serial
killer not a monster like

744
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.500
I think that's the quote it's something
like that like I am

745
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.380
Chucky kind of flips the script the
series flips the script on that because

746
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.059
they kill not the gay characters or the
the kill them they kill the homophobes

747
00:54:03.059 --> 00:54:05.880
they kill the bigots that's because
those are the real detriment to society

748
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.300
yeah and I just want to sort of you know
which is you know to all the credit to

749
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.619
Don Mancini because like he's been
trying to do this since 1988. um and

750
00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:16.680
that's something that I really want to
have reflected in my own work even as I

751
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.920
discuss like sort of topics about
weakness like my writing anyway topics

752
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.540
yeah weakness and sort of what to do and
sort of make it about that what do we do

753
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.180
about living in a society where
everything is kind of like this yeah

754
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:31.440
there is this kind of very strong
nihilistic sensibility that's kind of

755
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.300
permeating a lot of this kind of very
like edgy violence which previously

756
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.260
Bleak media is like I like having that
sort of sense of Triumph yeah I like

757
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.520
having a sense of you know prevalence uh
determination sort of like you know

758
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.420
right Rising above in spite of that and
finding personal fulfillment

759
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.960
um but the alternative the thing I find
about a lot of this kind of gratuitous

760
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.420
complete media is that it's pointing out
like

761
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:59.700
um sort of saying like look at the sort
of dregs and as a reflection of our own

762
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:05.099
Society it's saying look at the dregs of
our society and the nihilism and all of

763
00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:08.339
this stuff and isn't this so terrible
and this is where and you know getting

764
00:55:08.339 --> 00:55:11.579
in talking about cyberpunk and address
and specifically look at where our

765
00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:15.599
society is headed into this nihilistic
Bleak people area where everyone is

766
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:20.040
acclimated to sexual objectification and
where everyone is completely acclimated

767
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.359
to death and murder and mass shootings
to the point where there are lotteries

768
00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:29.640
about how many people died yesterday
um is this nihilistic media not pushing

769
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.660
us to that society that it's warning us
about yeah is my kind of hatred of that

770
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.040
is like that you are accomplishing the
thing that you are warning us of yeah

771
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.720
and so that's where I feel like the
alarmism is on my part

772
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.740
um and why like you know
ironically this Lasher like this lashers

773
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.619
under like you said it does seem to have
a lot of that sense of hope like you

774
00:55:49.619 --> 00:55:53.579
know survival prevalence and well yeah
and I mean usually and you know in part

775
00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:56.640
one the final girl beats the Killer and
then in part two she dies in the first

776
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.339
scene because you know you gotta cycle
through actors gotta keep them young

777
00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:01.920
yeah
um

778
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:07.200
but I I find hor it's it's so weird that
Horror in general is somewhere where you

779
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.200
can go
to

780
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.880
feel relief
because in the real world it feels like

781
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:20.339
the bad guys always win yeah but in
horror in most cases

782
00:56:20.339 --> 00:56:25.260
in typical horror movies the bad guys
lose well like is it really scary if

783
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.140
ever like the thing about horror is like
it's meant to you know chill you thrill

784
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:34.200
you and fulfill you
um is it really horror if everyone dies

785
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.920
it is the horror not someone surviving
with these memories and I mean those

786
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.119
movies do exist and there there's a
place for them and some of them are

787
00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:45.839
fantastic like I said hereditary not a
happy ending

788
00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:50.640
um and it got a lot of bad reviews
because it was very much not a happy

789
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.220
ending
um

790
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:58.440
but at the same time and like those type
of movies and TV shows I I feel like

791
00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.099
they work for movies better because TV
shows are so long that you're just

792
00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:05.760
getting you get mired in it whereas a
movie it's two hours and then it's over

793
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.400
and then you can kind of think about it
and stuff and you don't have to be like

794
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.920
oh what's coming next but like I think

795
00:57:13.319 --> 00:57:16.200
like you mentioned Attack on Titan
earlier and I think this would be a good

796
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:22.800
way to a good place to kind of close the
the the podcast in my sort of thinking

797
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:27.180
on this yeah is that
I loved Attack on Titan and I'm super

798
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:33.059
excited for season four part three next
year I can't wait

799
00:57:33.059 --> 00:57:36.900
but if they announce season two of Yuri
on ice

800
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.440
I would cream my pants and learn how to
speak Japanese so I could watch it

801
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:46.859
immediately oh my God right like because
I don't know if it has a happy ending or

802
00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:51.660
not but I know that there will be
positivity here's the thing I don't need

803
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.559
a happy ending no no I know like Yuri on
Ice season one doesn't have a happy

804
00:57:55.559 --> 00:58:00.660
ending Yuri doesn't win yeah but it
still ends on a positive note it was

805
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.859
feeling it accomplished what it wanted
to do in the sense like you you end up

806
00:58:04.859 --> 00:58:08.880
happy for the characters these care yeah
exactly that's the thing and it gives

807
00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.140
you hope these characters you know the
the happy-go-lucky ending didn't happen

808
00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.020
but they've accomplished everything that
they wanted and that they didn't know

809
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.339
they wanted yeah and like you can kind
of live vicariously through their hope

810
00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:25.380
of what's next yeah instead of
you were characters looking forward to

811
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.700
the future rather than reflecting in the
past on the horrible stuff of the past

812
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.540
yeah and dreading the future yeah which
Attack on Titan very much does fit into

813
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:37.079
that yeah and I mean that's one of the
reasons that you know a lot of people

814
00:58:37.079 --> 00:58:41.940
are like House of the Dragon is better
than the rings of power but House of the

815
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.859
Dragon I like I said I know this doesn't
end well for the targaryens but the

816
00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:51.720
rings of power I know
it ends well yeah all of this is

817
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.339
stemming from the fact that I I am
resenting a society where things going

818
00:58:56.339 --> 00:59:00.359
wrong is considered automatically better
than things are going or going to go

819
00:59:00.359 --> 00:59:05.099
things are going to be fine media wise
anyway yeah and I I I wish we could have

820
00:59:05.099 --> 00:59:08.819
that in our society a sense that things
are going to be better but they don't

821
00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:14.640
and that's being reflected in Media I I
think it is being reflected in media I I

822
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:19.079
think a lot of it is
people kind of seeing you know things

823
00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:22.799
like the election of Donald Trump for
instance and seeing like God things are

824
00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:28.260
getting worse how Italy just elected a
fascist stuff like that and it's like

825
00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:33.660
things are getting worse and worse
because that's what we're talking about

826
00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:37.079
that's what the news is talking about
we're not talking about the good things

827
00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:41.579
yeah
just like House of the Dragon Trends

828
00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:46.920
everyone loves everyone's watching it
rings of power doesn't Trend because and

829
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.940
it's not again it's not necessarily
rings of power might not be as well a

830
00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:57.900
made show but you know I just see it as
you know one show is depressing and kind

831
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:04.140
of uh kind of vindicates your own
depression of well life is [ __ ] look

832
01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.319
even my favorite TV show is telling me
life is [ __ ]

833
01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:12.599
whereas rings of power is kind of like
maybe not

834
01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:16.799
but where where do you go from life is
[ __ ] what do you do with all that's

835
01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:21.059
exactly the problem that's why I'm not
watching House of the Dragon you you if

836
01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:24.480
the only messaging you get is life is
[ __ ] that's telling you to be okay with

837
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.780
it life is [ __ ] so I'm not gonna do
anything about it well it's [ __ ] in here

838
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.660
everyone's telling me [ __ ] I actually
just learning to deal with it no change

839
01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.380
your circumstances [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it is
possible to change your circumstances

840
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.579
and that's what I'm not for everyone

841
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:44.099
like if you are you know a gay person
living in Iran okay you can't just hop

842
01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:48.720
on a plane and move to when I say San
Francisco [ __ ] I mean like there is a

843
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.520
power in collectivism there is a power
in you know being part of something

844
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.780
there is a power in starting movements
absolutely I think a lot of people I

845
01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:02.700
think I think a big reason a lot of this
depressing media is taking hold right

846
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:09.660
now is because a lot of people
are exhausted yeah and they feel like

847
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.980
and that's what I feel like like when
Joe Biden did the student debt

848
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.980
forgiveness thing where it was only ten
thousand dollars twenty thousand for

849
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:21.900
Pell Grant and stuff like that it was so
much less than what people wanted but it

850
01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.780
was like
this tiny little light and people were

851
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.160
like oh my God a good thing happened
Jesus Christ a good thing happened yeah

852
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:35.160
and so nobody well people [ __ ]
complained about it but like nobody on

853
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.960
the right side of History complained
about it like they were like could have

854
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.220
been better I will accept this nobody on
the left side of History

855
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.079
um oh my God left behind why can that
not be a documentary about the well

856
01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:52.500
because Left Behind is a documentary
about the or is a book I know I know at

857
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.920
the end of the world
you know the ways that the the left is

858
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.520
uh decentralizing and kind of spiraling
because we can't really decide on what

859
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.020
we want
well you could do that left behind

860
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.260
all right so that has been the 16th
episode of the padreon thank you all so

861
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.799
much for listening and thank you all so
much for being patrons you make

862
01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:19.440
everything we do possible and
reduce viewers like you well literally

863
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.359
and and reduce so much freaking stress
because if we had to rely on YouTube we

864
01:02:24.359 --> 01:02:29.460
would not be able to do yeah you know
any of this there'd be a video a year

865
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.359
um it would be a hobby still yeah it
would just yeah we wouldn't be able to

866
01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:39.900
do this so thank you guys so much we
love you all and uh I hope you enjoy the
