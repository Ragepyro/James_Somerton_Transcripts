00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.640
hello everyone and welcome to episode 17
of the padreon which I'm actually going

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.599
to release as a special public episode
um so it's not just for patrons this one

3
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.539
the next episode will go back to being
patreon exclusive but this one I

4
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
wanted to talk about something that I
thought I'm gonna get asked about it

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
anyway so I might as well kind of just
put it out there

6
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.759
um so if you're listening for the first
time this is my patreon exclusive

7
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.579
podcast the padreon my name is James
Nick is usually accompanying me but he

8
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.360
is at home visiting family right now so
you've only got me this time around but

9
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.420
I've got some thoughts
so this will be going out on Tuesday

10
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.020
October 4th
and this past weekend the movie Bros

11
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.039
from Universal Pictures was released in
theaters

12
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.780
very wide release it had 3300 screens
um across North America

13
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.400
so that would be Canada the US and
Mexico

14
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.520
um which people just call the American
Market or the domestic Market

15
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
um but it was sent out to a huge number
of screens and had a huge marketing

16
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.140
Blitz behind it TV commercials online
ads Billboards in every major city

17
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.960
across the US and Canada
and it only made 4.8 million dollars

18
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.220
which
is an issue

19
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.720
because I have not been able to track
down the budget of the movie

20
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.740
but as you know as I have talked about
in many videos the budget of a movie

21
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.840
in order to make back in order for a
movie to make a profit it needs to make

22
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.760
roughly twice the production budget and
that's being very generous because

23
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.500
that's not taking into account the
marketing budget and that's because

24
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.459
roughly I say this roughly because
Disney has kind of broken the rules on

25
00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.180
this a theater will get about 50 percent
theaters will get about 50 percent of

26
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.940
the uh the gross
and the studio will get the other 50 and

27
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.599
then the studio will you know that will
cover their production costs their

28
00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.239
post-production cost their marketing
that also needs to include back end for

29
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.280
actors which is when an actor when they
sign their contract they make a deal to

30
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
get paid a little bit of the gross or
the net

31
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.140
um that the movie brings in at the box
office

32
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.300
always better to
I think it's the gross yeah always

33
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.040
better to go for the gross because the
net is basically how much the movie made

34
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400
after cost
and because of Hollywood accounting

35
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.459
which I could do a whole video on their
movies never make a profit

36
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.720
the Lord of the Rings
technically according to new line cinema

37
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.180
at the time lost money
each Lord of the Rings movie made about

38
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.280
a billion dollars so
you know that's just not true

39
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.520
um but back to Bros
4.8 million dollars

40
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.780
[Music]
um

41
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.620
not great at all it had a steady drop
across the weekend

42
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:54.180
um for Saturday it dropped 4.1 percent
which is not great usually percentage

43
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.640
um goes up box office percentage growth
goes up on Saturday

44
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.180
but you know it went down which isn't
horrible the bad thing is that on Sunday

45
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.000
it dropped 29.6 percent
which even though its Cinema score right

46
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.760
now I believe is an a cinema score which
if you don't know what Cinema score is

47
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.919
that is when
um there are people sent out to random

48
00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.240
theaters across the United States who
when you see a movie they will ask you

49
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.720
what did you think of the movie
everyone says that they've never been

50
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.340
asked anything like that because most of
us haven't

51
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.060
um
these they go to the most random places

52
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.199
sometimes they'll go specifically to big
cities sometimes they'll go to you know

53
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.940
the Small Town Theater and somewhere in
the midwest

54
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.660
but most people have never been cornered
by Cinema score and asked what would you

55
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.940
rate this movie and the cinema cinema
score ratings go from a plus all the way

56
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.660
I think to D minus I don't think they go
to F I might be wrong but I don't think

57
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.880
they go to F at least I've never seen a
movie get rated f

58
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.360
um
but basically

59
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.620
any movie that gets an A in front of it
means that the audience is really really

60
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.800
liked it
um

61
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.660
and so a minus a A plus means you're
good you're probably gonna have good

62
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.780
legs at the box office I mean which
means you're going to last for a while

63
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.620
you're gonna keep going

64
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.280
and Bros got an A but made very little
money usually when a movie gets an a

65
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.600
cinema score what happens is over the
weekend

66
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.120
the box office numbers actually go up
whereas with Bros it went down which

67
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:57.960
says to me that it got it the audience
that was excited for Bros went to see it

68
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.060
right away
and then continued to drop off

69
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.220
throughout the weekend so that would
probably be white gay men

70
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.240
um
and some straight women I'm assuming I'm

71
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.160
not sure what the audience breakdown is
Box Office Mojo used to give that kind

72
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.039
of information they don't anymore unless
you sign up and pay them and I'm not

73
00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.759
paying them for something they used to
give for free but

74
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.440
um I'm assuming you know white gay men
were the majority of the people who went

75
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.360
to see Bros opening weekend
uh it didn't get an international

76
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.500
release and at least not yet there have
been plenty of countries that have said

77
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.280
they're not going to show the movie
there's no shocker there you know

78
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.180
countries in Africa and the Middle East
and some in Eastern Europe things like

79
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.600
that they some countries in Asia have
said they're not going to show it

80
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.220
because in those countries it is illegal
to be gay or to at least act upon your

81
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.319
gayness
um

82
00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:03.479
sometimes punishable by prison sentence
sometimes by Death and so that was no

83
00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:09.180
shocker but it didn't doesn't have a
European release yet which I personally

84
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.520
found shocking
um

85
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.259
but Billy Eichner who produced the movie
co-wrote the movie stars in the movie uh

86
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:21.060
has already come out today and said that
the reason it didn't make that it didn't

87
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.639
do well at the box office is because
straight people didn't show up for the

88
00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.639
movie
and

89
00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.940
I would like to say to Mr Eichner
the

90
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:43.139
um the advertising campaign
was I think very focused on the gay

91
00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.840
Market
um

92
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.940
the entire cast was made up of queer
people which is great

93
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.639
um
but you know they did a lot about

94
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.620
talking about how the entire cast was
made up of queer people and

95
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:05.520
they marketed the movie in the trailers
with lots of kind of gay in jokes

96
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.000
um
jokes about poppers and and the like

97
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.240
things like that things that straight
people probably wouldn't get

98
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.520
and they marketed it as a very very very
very very very very very very

99
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.720
gay movie
um so I don't know why they're surprised

100
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.199
that
straight audiences

101
00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:35.279
didn't show up to it especially straight
male audiences it's not that shocking to

102
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:40.339
me
uh Billy Eichner is a very

103
00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:44.480
contentious
personality within the queer Community

104
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.440
uh some people find him very annoying
um

105
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.519
I am kind of
I don't find him annoying I don't find

106
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:58.200
him Charming I'm kind of in the middle
I'm very like meh about him I was very

107
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.339
excited for the movie when the trailer
came out and everything because you know

108
00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:08.640
the whole marketing campaign was about
how this is the first big budget

109
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.580
romantic comedy coming from a big Studio
it's made by Universal

110
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.420
um
and you know and so get excited because

111
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.620
this is the first romance gay romantic
comedy coming from a big Studio get

112
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.240
excited oh my God
and

113
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.380
I was excited
when the first trailers came out when it

114
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.860
was announced when it was announced I
was about I was a bit

115
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.670
um I had my trepidations about it
because

116
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.459
[Music]
um

117
00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:45.240
I thought well this is just gonna be you
know like every other gay romantic

118
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.779
comedy except with a higher budget and
apparently

119
00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:55.980
it's not just every other gay romantic
comedy with a higher budget but amped up

120
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:02.519
to 11. it kind of takes the gay in jokes
and just like

121
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:07.380
ramps them up
um which again

122
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:16.200
would be I think anyway it would make
straight people feel excluded now

123
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.660
the
question being you know okay so you've

124
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.600
made a movie
straight people felt excluded they

125
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.980
didn't go see it or
you know is it that straight people felt

126
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.300
excluded from the movie because of the
ad campaign

127
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.560
or
were they just not interested

128
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:44.220
or did gay people not feel
all that excited about the movie

129
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.260
because
I know a lot of gay people as you may

130
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.220
know
uh or as at least as you have probably

131
00:10:53.220 --> 00:11:00.540
assumed and
lots and lots of gay people

132
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.680
were not excited for this movie for any
number of reasons a lot of people were

133
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:11.120
annoyed by Billy Eichner a lot of people
kind of looked at it as

134
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.440
uh kind of get oddly because we we
always talk about how we want you know

135
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.820
gay characters in movies to be played by
gaycare by gay actors Etc but because

136
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.220
this was all Queer an all Queer cast a
lot of people in the community felt like

137
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.399
it was kind of
ghettoizing because there were no

138
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:36.839
that's it seemed like Okay so this movie
straight people don't even want to be

139
00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:40.680
involved in it
um

140
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:47.700
which you know whether that's
a legitimate criticism or just kind of

141
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:54.600
uh being in your own little gay world is
Up For Debate but so you know that the

142
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.560
question that I posed
uh is it because the Straits didn't go

143
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.779
because they felt excluded because they
just weren't interested or was it

144
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:07.620
because gays weren't interested and I
know that a lot of gay people were not

145
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.019
interested in Bros for any number of
reasons like I said annoyed by Billy

146
00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:19.019
Eichner
a lot of people are annoyed that

147
00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:24.060
it's just two white guys
um

148
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:30.860
you know who look like
80 percent of the white guys on Grindr

149
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.459
and so
you know okay if I want to spend two

150
00:12:35.459 --> 00:12:40.019
hours with those people
I can just go to a gay bar I can just go

151
00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:48.120
to a drag race party you know I will I
can find them very easily and

152
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.820
the fact that it is just
two white guys

153
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.980
when there's already been uh I forget
the movie's name now single all the way

154
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.980
I think is uh what it was called came
out on Netflix this past Christmas where

155
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.160
it's an interracial couple
and you've got Fire Island which has a

156
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.480
diverse cast and you know not a white
cast

157
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.420
you know and a predominantly Asian cast
which is incredibly rare

158
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.360
and then Billy Eichner gets out there
and starts talking about

159
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.279
how
this is revolutionary because this is

160
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:37.860
the first gay rom-com and things like
that and real really running with this

161
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.060
is the first gay movie
first gay rom-com from a major studio

162
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.040
and really running with a major Studio
thing which

163
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.760
that's when I stopped being excited for
the movie

164
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.579
because I
have seen a lot of

165
00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:59.700
queer movies
um

166
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.620
starring straight actors queer actors
with you know queer writers and

167
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.899
directors straight writers and directors
I have seen a lot of queer movies

168
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.779
um
good and bad

169
00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.560
and

170
00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:24.240
just sort of ignoring them
uh writing them off as not being as

171
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.440
important because they didn't come from
one of the big used to be the big five

172
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.139
Studios but I think it's three now
um maybe four

173
00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:38.639
felt very
uh

174
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:45.120
like privileged
um to me because

175
00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:52.620
you know for so long
gay movies have had to be produced how

176
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.139
they could be produced which is being
produced by independent Studios but uh

177
00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:03.180
an independent production companies and
uh completely independently produced

178
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.920
movies that are just
you know financed and produced by one

179
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.500
person and that's kind of just how queer
movies have had to be made for the

180
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.399
longest time and these are the queer
movies that

181
00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:24.899
broke ground that revolutionized what
could be shown on film you know within

182
00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:28.920
the United States all across Europe and
Asia like

183
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.380
two white guys falling in love in New
York City I think it takes place in New

184
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.740
York
uh

185
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:46.699
is not very revolutionary anymore
no matter what studio it comes from

186
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:54.199
and
that's the issue I think

187
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.579
this sort of we made a movie with the
big boys

188
00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:04.980
we made a movie that because it was
green lit by Universal Pictures we've

189
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.019
made a gay movie
that has been approved by the Straits is

190
00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:14.760
how it feels like and because it's been
approved by the Straits The Straits gave

191
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.800
us money to make this movie
you should support it

192
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.800
and

193
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.199
like that was already implicitly there
because it was a big deal that Universal

194
00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:33.260
was financing this movie
um

195
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:39.779
but the other thing is
it's not even true

196
00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:45.959
that
you know a gay romantic comedy

197
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:51.360
or you know gay romance even
that this is the first one that comes

198
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.160
from a major Studio because
you know love it or hate it love Simon

199
00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.320
was produced by Fox

200
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.720
like five years ago
so it's not

201
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.620
even revolutionary in the way that it
thinks it was and they were really

202
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.900
playing up this whole like
how revolutionary it was that a major

203
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:22.620
Studio was producing
this movie and

204
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:30.740
it's just so it feels so blind because
they're you know you've got the obvious

205
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.580
ones you've got Brokeback Mountain and
you've got Moonlight and you've got the

206
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.480
bird cage and
um

207
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:46.860
other movies like that and you've got
innumerable independently produced

208
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:52.620
uh gay romantic comedies gay romances
gay tragedies gay you know not action

209
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.400
movies but you know basically gay movies
that run the gamut have been produced

210
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.820
independently and
so I feel like a lot of gay people kind

211
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.980
of
looked at the way the production team

212
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:15.320
was acting mostly Billy Eichner but it
wasn't just Billy Eichner and kind of

213
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.559
disregarding
all of these other

214
00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:23.880
gay and queer movies that
you know

215
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.440
laid that yellow brick road for Bros to
get

216
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.620
a green light from Universal Pictures
and just

217
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.299
completely disregarding them and
pretending that they don't matter

218
00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:45.539
that they don't exist that they're not
as important because they maybe were not

219
00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:50.940
green lit by
the straight Studio

220
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.940
um that they were you know financed by
an independent Studio

221
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.799
independent studios are the reason we
have queer cinema at all

222
00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:08.100
even Brokeback Mountain was financed by
an independent Studio

223
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.700
so

224
00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:16.280
just just writing off all of these
movies

225
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:23.100
and you know it's funny the the other
love Simon came from Fox

226
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.480
just five years ago
and I guess that's not technically a

227
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.880
romantic comedy
but the other thing that

228
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.960
Billy Eichner doesn't seem to be taking
into consideration with his comments

229
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.419
about
uh how the movie didn't do well because

230
00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:46.980
the Straits didn't show up
straights haven't been showing up for

231
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:53.160
straight romantic comedies either
like with minor exceptions like crazy

232
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.500
Rich Asians
romantic comedies haven't been doing

233
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.460
well
for about a decade

234
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.200
basically since Netflix started making
movies

235
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.980
romantic comedies haven't been doing
well because

236
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.840
you know going to a theater to a movie
theater it's not cheap you know tickets

237
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.160
can run anywhere from ten to twenty
dollars or more if you're in like a city

238
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.960
like New York
and so and then you've got the popcorn

239
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.160
and you've got you know travel and
parking and all that kind of stuff

240
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.179
and the you know the effort to get to
the movie theater if you have a car that

241
00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:36.600
you might be in traffic if you don't
have a car then you got to get on buses

242
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.200
and stuff like that and so there's a lot
of effort to go to a movie theater these

243
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.799
days
uh it's not like you know the 70s where

244
00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:47.700
everyone lived in a suburb and everyone
had a car and it was just you know a

245
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.260
nickel it wasn't a nickel but it was
cheap it was like 250. I remember just

246
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.320
going to
um movies when I was a kid and

247
00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:05.400
the matinee pricing for people under 16
was 4.50

248
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.720
there are no movie tickets for four
dollars and fifty cents now matinee or

249
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.360
not
um and I mean that was only like 20

250
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.360
years ago
so you know going all the way back to

251
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.179
the 80s and the 70s and the 60s and
stuff like that like whole different

252
00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:22.799
ball game but even just going back 20
years when romantic comedies were kind

253
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:27.780
of at their Zenith when you were getting
movies like Runaway Bride

254
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.659
um
movies that and my best friend's wedding

255
00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:36.120
and things like that movies that did
incredibly well at that time it was way

256
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.059
cheaper to go to the movies and so now
that movies are so expensive

257
00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:46.740
and going to theaters is kind of really
inconvenient

258
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:53.240
people audiences have really started to
say

259
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.440
is this
worth the effort

260
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.200
of going to a theater to see it
um

261
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.860
because

262
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.299
it's a lot of effort
and you know people will go to see

263
00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:17.340
you know black panther when that comes
out they will go to see

264
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.140
um Spider-Man they will go to see
um

265
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.900
the
Tom Cruise

266
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.440
fighter jet movie oh my God I can't
believe I'm blanking on the name

267
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.620
um
[Music]

268
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:39.419
Top Gun uh top gun Maverick the new one
that came out this summer and made a

269
00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:45.960
friggin Fortune
um they will go to see these movies and

270
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.280
they will go to see them
because they feel like they're getting

271
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.320
their money's worth because it is
spectacle you know it's just like when

272
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.480
TV came out and Hollywood really had to
rejigger what they were doing and so

273
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.980
they started making gigantic spectacles
they started making the greatest show on

274
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.940
Earth they started making Ben Hur and
the Ten Commandments and things like

275
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.179
that
in the robe

276
00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:20.520
um and it was a while before the
before Hollywood got to settle down

277
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:26.720
where people were like
you know TV isn't giving me something

278
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:33.900
that even low budget or mid-range movies
can give me

279
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.700
which was
Quality quality writing quality acting

280
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:46.740
quality production quality
now you're in a really weird space where

281
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:55.880
you're even getting like Blockbuster
Lord of the Rings MCU style shows

282
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:02.340
on streaming and and like obviously
there's you know the rings of power and

283
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.240
uh House of the dragon and some of the
Marvel shows some of them are pretty

284
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.299
cheap some of them come across as pretty
cheap

285
00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:13.679
um
but I think that Loki and Falcon and the

286
00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:17.820
Winter Soldier did not come across as
cheap I'm I'm not a fan of

287
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.500
a huge fan of either of those shows but
they didn't come across as cheap

288
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.580
um
the whereas I think I think the Star

289
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.280
Wars shows come across as pretty cheap
but

290
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.880
um
and as you you get stranger things which

291
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.360
the special effects and everything from
stranger things rivals in my opinion

292
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.220
anything that's been on the big screen
in you know for as long as I can

293
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.940
remember
and you know you do have shows like the

294
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.960
rings of power which Amazon spent a
billion dollars on

295
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.700
and
you know how can a movie like Bros

296
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.320
compete
with those things because you can't even

297
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.059
say really the argument of well the
straights don't show up for gay content

298
00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:09.240
because that's not even true because
Heart Stopper was a huge success

299
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.000
even
um

300
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.520
uh young Royals was a huge success and
that wasn't even in English like you had

301
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.640
to read subtitles for that it was still
a huge success

302
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.559
if you for First Blood you know there's
the big controversy about

303
00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:30.059
First Blood being canceled and
everything because it was relatively uh

304
00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:33.960
expensive show far more expensive than
Heart Stopper

305
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.100
um but
that the

306
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.580
uh First Blood didn't have a great
completion rate

307
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:48.900
on Netflix which is why it got canceled
but if First Blood was a movie

308
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:54.600
you know it would have people started it
you can only you know you can't well I

309
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.779
guess you can walk out of a movie
halfway through but you know you go to a

310
00:25:57.779 --> 00:26:00.299
movie you usually watch the whole thing
and that's a ticket that is bought and

311
00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:03.419
paid for
and so it's not that the audience

312
00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:12.179
doesn't exist for this stuff it's that
with the gay like it's not just gay

313
00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:16.200
people that made Heart Stopper huge and
it's not just gay people that made young

314
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.799
Royals huge I know more straight people
who have watched Heart Stopper and young

315
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:25.740
Royals then
then I do then I do gay people

316
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.600
um
and I think

317
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.940
and this is
and and so I I don't think it's that

318
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.840
straight people didn't show up
because straight people have been

319
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.299
showing up for queer content
when it's easily accessible which is on

320
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:48.360
streaming
um

321
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.500
single all the way did incredibly well
if it didn't Hallmark wouldn't have just

322
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.880
greenlit their first gay Christmas movie
which they did it's gonna be a gay

323
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.140
Hallmark Christmas movie this this
Christmas season

324
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.900
um
and so you know they saw the numbers

325
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.460
they they
said oh we want some of that and now

326
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:14.240
they're going to get some of that
because when it is accessible

327
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.860
people will watch queer content
whether it is

328
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.559
about
um

329
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.080
you know gay people lesbians trans
people

330
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.419
non-binary people they will watch it if
it's good and easily accessible

331
00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:41.340
Netflix is kind of a messed up situation
because Netflix is canceling a lot of

332
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.520
shows that shouldn't be canceled right
now and I don't looking at the numbers

333
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.340
First Blood should not have been
canceled

334
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.400
like two years ago a year ago First
Blood wouldn't have been canceled it

335
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.940
would have been renewed
um

336
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.740
and to my knowledge the only reason that
Heart Stopper got renewed with Netflix's

337
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.659
crunch is that Heart Stopper has a uh an
outside Studio producing it it's not

338
00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:10.559
Netflix dependent uh Netflix is mostly a
distributor for Heart Stopper

339
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:15.779
um and so it's not just that straight
people didn't go see it

340
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:22.200
it is a conflagration of things straight
people not going to see it not because

341
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.179
they're homophobic which
Billy Eichner accused straight audiences

342
00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:33.419
of being homophobic for not going to see
his movie uh that's not a good look but

343
00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:38.460
not because they're homophobic but
because theaters are expensive and kind

344
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.980
of a [ __ ] to get to and a lot of people
still aren't comfortable going to

345
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.480
theaters believe it or not there is
still a pandemic going on I have been

346
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.880
very choosy with which movies I have
gone to theaters to see I was going to

347
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.740
go see Bros in theaters I was going to
you know Brave the kovid but

348
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.880
I didn't
um and I've I've got four vaccinations

349
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.059
and I didn't go see Bros because of the
drama surrounding it

350
00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:11.120
um

351
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.940
and so it's not because straight
audiences are homophobic

352
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:24.179
like I said it's a conflagration it's
theaters are expensive theaters in this

353
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:28.200
especially in the United States are
messy you have a bad experience in

354
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.440
theaters when you have people you know
in there on their phones and stuff like

355
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.500
that and talking to each other and the
ushers you know they don't want to get

356
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.020
into a fight with someone so they're not
going to go tell someone that they have

357
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.899
to put their phone away
um

358
00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:42.960
I've actually never experienced that in
Canada but I hear that it's like

359
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.440
horrible in the U.S
um

360
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.899
so you know theaters are expensive and
messy the access isn't there

361
00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:54.020
um

362
00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:00.179
and I and you know he also pissed off a
lot of gay people

363
00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:06.720
by basically
growing all of these queer movies

364
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.600
that have defined queer Cinema
some of which have actually helped to

365
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.220
Define Cinema like I'm not a huge fan of
Brokeback Mountain but Brokeback

366
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:22.559
Mountain
defined Cinema for a while like

367
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:27.240
romance movies that came after Brokeback
Mountain were all aping off of it

368
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:34.320
so like these movies have done that you
have and you have had huge successes in

369
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.500
the past like The Birdcage so it's not
like audiences are homophobic

370
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.000
I think
that

371
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.220
the whole
I I think so there's all of that

372
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:57.419
but I also think that it's a gay movie
wasn't a great way to sell

373
00:30:57.419 --> 00:31:00.080
a movie

374
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.700
just like I think
it's a quote-unquote black movie

375
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.260
isn't a great way to sell a movie
um

376
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.320
if you look at movies recently that have
been uh and to use that as an example if

377
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:23.340
you look at movies recently that have
been just about the black experience and

378
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.659
especially in America
they don't do

379
00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:31.919
terribly well
they don't get big releases they get

380
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.760
much smaller releases than Bros did in
fact

381
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.659
but when you have a movie like black
panther

382
00:31:39.659 --> 00:31:45.059
which is you know very much about
black you know

383
00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:50.640
the black experience but it's not the
America the African-American experience

384
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.419
um
it speaks to that but that's not the

385
00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:58.140
Crux of the story
it does incredibly well

386
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.399
you know black panther had a lot of
white people going to see it

387
00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:06.779
um
it was a huge four quadrant movie

388
00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:09.679
and

389
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:18.260
I think that's the thing the marketing
it as the gay rom-com

390
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.159
was the problem
I think the rom-com thing is an issue

391
00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:27.179
because people don't see rom-coms as
theater worthy anymore there's too many

392
00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:31.260
of them too many of them on Netflix
sorry rom-coms are kind of dead in

393
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.299
theaters and I don't think they're gonna
come back uh unless they're huge they've

394
00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:39.960
got like big budgets and stuff like that
like crazy Rich Asians and they're kind

395
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.659
of tourist tourism porn is kind of what
crazy Rich Asians was

396
00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:47.880
um
but

397
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.200
there's
this sort of

398
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.820
I don't I don't know like it just
there's so many reasons for why this

399
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:05.520
movie didn't do well and for him to get
on social media and just chalk it all up

400
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.779
to well straight people are homophobic
and they didn't go see it

401
00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:12.960
it's like well they're not gonna
definitely not gonna go see it now

402
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.220
friend
um

403
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.940
and you know it's

404
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.500
it's uh you know it's frustrating
because I wanted the movie to do well

405
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:31.919
but like I said the this is a gay movie
kind of selling it like this is a gay

406
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:36.500
movie
was a problem

407
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.399
because
when you look at the the queer things

408
00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:45.539
that have been
very successful recently

409
00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:50.399
things like Heart Stopper and things
like young Royals

410
00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:57.600
they have
gay and queer couplings at their Center

411
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.980
but that's not what it's about it's not
about being queer it's about something

412
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:08.520
else and the characters are incidentally
queer you know young Royals is about

413
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:14.940
income inequality and think you know
things like that and and you know

414
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:22.679
um Family pressure and things like that
the main couple just happened to be two

415
00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.020
guys
um

416
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.060
same thing with Heart Stopper Heart
Stopper has a gay couple and a lesbian

417
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:36.060
couple and a straight couple one of the
uh and one of the straight couple

418
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.639
happens to be trans
and

419
00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:47.639
so it feels more open
because it's not about being gay Heart

420
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:54.060
Stopper isn't about being queer
heartstopper is about being a teenager

421
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.780
um
going through kind of the same things

422
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.680
mostly that straight teenagers go
through except you know putting an extra

423
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.700
layer of stress on there which creates
drama which is good for television

424
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.760
um

425
00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:19.740
another sh and I think a good comparison
for Bros would actually be the recent

426
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.119
um
Queer as Folk reincarnation which has

427
00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:30.000
recently been canceled after one season
and it was you know obviously it was

428
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.220
this is the gay show
um gay characters by the queer show gay

429
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.180
characters bisexual characters trans
characters non-binary characters

430
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.060
just you know running the gamut
um

431
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.640
[Music]
and

432
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:53.280
I don't think that show had any like
solid lesbians

433
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.740
interesting
um

434
00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.660
but
that may have felt exclusionary to

435
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.980
straight audiences because
not even that there was no straight

436
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.900
characters but that it was all about the
queerness

437
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.079
the trauma of being queer the stress of
being queer how hard it is to be queer

438
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:22.880
oh my God life is terrible oh we're
being murdered that's Aids HIV etc etc

439
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:29.780
whereas Bros was very much
the

440
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:38.359
not even queer the gay romantic comedy
and

441
00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:42.420
I feel like that makes it less
accessible

442
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:46.859
than something like young Royals
where

443
00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:51.000
it's a show about teenagers with drama
it's kind of you know Swedish Gossip

444
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.400
Girl if you will where the main couple
just happens to be gay incidental

445
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.940
queerness

446
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.300
and I think

447
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.920
what we need to reckon with
is that

448
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.900
although a lot of us may want to see
I don't want to say militant

449
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.760
representation but very you know pointed
representation

450
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.520
of you know this is a queer thing

451
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:32.040
that incidental queerness
may actually be more accessible

452
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.780
to a wider audience

453
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:43.560
and for God's sake start casting people
of color Jesus like

454
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.240
you found the two whitest guys gay guys
in Hollywood

455
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.000
I'm like God damn it
um

456
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.960
yeah
it's just

457
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:03.119
it's it's I I'm disappointed that
with what has happened with Bros that

458
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:06.599
they that the box office wasn't there
the people didn't show up but at the

459
00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:10.260
same time I'm kind of
disappointed with the I'm very

460
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.500
disappointed with the production team
with just how they sold it as you know

461
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.839
the first gay rom-com all that
um

462
00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:23.099
so I'm kind of disappointed with the
whole situation

463
00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:28.320
that
it was allowed to get there

464
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.520
and be that
disappointing

465
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.020
um especially because
from

466
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:43.260
critics and stuff let's
just quickly before I wrap up

467
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:49.400
um
have a look at

468
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:53.780
where it is on

469
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.099
Rotten Tomatoes
which I can't even find it on Rotten

470
00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.200
Tomatoes that's
there we go

471
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.520
so yeah it's got 91 audience score on
Rotten Tomatoes and a 90 critic score

472
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:17.780
with 134 reviews
that says people enjoyed the movie

473
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:23.640
the people who went to see the movie
which again I can't find any information

474
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.839
on the demographics
were the people who went to see the

475
00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:32.700
movie
a lot of

476
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:38.780
white gay men
and they're probably female friends

477
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.540
um

478
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:50.760
and you know there's also the issue of
it being rated R and you know it's

479
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.579
labeled here strong sexual content some
drug use and language throughout

480
00:39:56.579 --> 00:39:59.820
maybe it shouldn't have been rated R
maybe you should have toned some stuff

481
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.560
down and the argument would be well then
it wouldn't be authentic

482
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.540
and if that's the movie you want to make
if that's this if that's the queer

483
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.420
population that you want to represent
that's fine awesome you know

484
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.780
code of many colors
but you have to realize that

485
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:27.540
when you put our rating on something
a huge section of the audience is

486
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.220
immediately removed from it
and like you really should have looked

487
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.839
at love Simon again
game movie recent game movie from a

488
00:40:36.839 --> 00:40:42.060
major Studio
love Simon didn't do that great

489
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.060
um

490
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:50.280
let's just since I'm on a
typing kick

491
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.440
love Simon total made 66 million dollars
on a budget of 17 million so it made

492
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.220
profit which is good
um which is why love Victor ended up

493
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.339
becoming a thing
um

494
00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:09.060
but they should have looked at that 66
million dollar worldwide gross okay so

495
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.660
it only had a 40 million dollar domestic
row so let's just work with the domestic

496
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.260
gross because Bros doesn't have an
international release yet

497
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.540
just a domestic gross of 40 million
dollars

498
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.400
and that was rated PG-13
you immediately need to take that 40

499
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.040
million dollars
and deduct from it because there is a

500
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.640
giant section of the audience that isn't
going to be able to go because they're

501
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.859
going to be too young to get into a
rated movie

502
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:45.240
or
you're going to be off-putting to a

503
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.119
section of the audience because you are
showing

504
00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:53.820
what I have heard to be kind of uh
sort of

505
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.099
uh words aren't working
unrestrained queerness unrestrained

506
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:03.119
queer sexuality
which I'm all all in favor for it's one

507
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:07.260
of the reasons I loved the new Queer as
Folk and the original queers folks that

508
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.520
they were very unrestrained in the queer
sexuality

509
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.520
um
but you know if you're if you want to

510
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.940
make a ton of money at the box office
you need to take into account that

511
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.780
that's going to make a lot of people
uncomfortable

512
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.079
um
and not just straight people there are a

513
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:28.980
lot of gay people who don't like the
idea of

514
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:34.500
the idea the public image of gay people
being

515
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:40.260
you know fisting Queens uh people who do
poppers uh people who do you know other

516
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:45.780
sex drugs things like that and so you've
got straight people and gay people

517
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.859
foreign
your movie

518
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:55.200
so you've got Billy Eichner being kind
of a dick talking you know just

519
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.220
throwing other gay movies under the bus
you've got people not wanting to go to

520
00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.520
theaters because of the pandemic you've
got people not wanting to go to theaters

521
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.640
because they're inconvenient you've got
people

522
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.640
uh
maybe being turned off

523
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.840
from the movie because it's very white
you've got people

524
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.140
[Music]
um maybe being turned off from the movie

525
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:24.300
because there's from the trailers there
weren't a whole hell of a lot of strong

526
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.180
female characters apparent
um

527
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.180
and
yeah you do and you've got that are

528
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:38.400
you've also got the R rating to contend
with you've also got the fact that it's

529
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.119
the beginning of October which isn't
exactly a huge box office month to begin

530
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:45.720
with you're releasing you know October
is spooky month and you release the

531
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:52.140
opposite a horror movie not smart
um you've also got the romantic comedies

532
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.180
in general have not been doing well find
me a straight romantic comedy other than

533
00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:01.260
crazy Rich Asians that has done super
well recently

534
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.819
and so you've got this Confluence of
events and and and things that are

535
00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:09.900
working against it
and then just coming out and saying it

536
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.000
didn't do well because straight people
are homophobic

537
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.319
not a great look
not a great look

538
00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:23.220
not a great look
um

539
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:28.140
so yeah what did you guys think uh have
you seen Bros have you watched it did

540
00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.880
you like it have you avoided it
um and if you have avoided it leave a

541
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.440
comment and let me know why you
specifically didn't want to see it and

542
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.819
also leave a comment letting me know if
you did see it and what you thought of

543
00:44:41.819 --> 00:44:46.380
it
um because I'm not against seeing it you

544
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.099
know I'm probably gonna wait to stream
it or something like that just because

545
00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:53.760
you know I am nervous about going to
theaters being asthmatic and covid still

546
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.400
being a thing
um

547
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.740
and having moved to a place where like
nobody wears masks anymore

548
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.980
um
yeah it makes me nervous

549
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.640
um
but yeah so this was a one-off public
