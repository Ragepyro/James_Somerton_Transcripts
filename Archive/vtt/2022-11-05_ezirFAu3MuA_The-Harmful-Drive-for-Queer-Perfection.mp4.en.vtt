1
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.780
one of the cornerstones that our society
is constructed around is success for all

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.240
that it is an abstract concept
we certainly push our entire lives to

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
meet it and yet has there ever been
anything so coveted that is so vaguely

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.359
defined
what is success what does success mean

5
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.580
and what does it mean to be successful
and most importantly

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.399
how do I get some of it it may seem
self-evident at first just

7
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.500
you know be successful and you know
you've got it when you've got a nice

8
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.219
house a nice car a good job but are you
really successful if someone has better

9
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.100
stuff than you if success is a gauge of
who's doing the best then we can only

10
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
say that one person is really successful
the power for Success needs to be low

11
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.500
enough to be attainable but high enough
that it can hover over your head like a

12
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
carrot on a fishing pole go on little
donkey go to school for accounting and

13
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
forget all about music production the
latter has a small chance of Mega

14
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.860
success whereas the former is a more
moderate success but is almost

15
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.119
guaranteed and you know not everyone can
be the next Lady Gaga maybe that idea of

16
00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.159
success is a bit too steep maybe it's
okay to settle for

17
00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.700
you know district manager but can you
really say that you're successful if you

18
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140
have to settle maybe success is relative
to what is available to you but then

19
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.340
again what excuse do you have for
patting yourself on the back for getting

20
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.680
that management promotion
when Janelle Monae was born in Kansas

21
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.640
City to a maid and a truck driver among
queer people there is a market push for

22
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.340
a kind of success because it is not a
success that is recognized by the masses

23
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.340
it's a quiet success that may go
uncredited in a person's lifetime for

24
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
the longest time queer people had to
live in the closet

25
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.099
so in many ways success was denied to
them if they didn't have the stomach for

26
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.660
starting a heteroalien family of their
own open queer people were shut out from

27
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.520
society and yet still we persisted we
still managed to become some of the

28
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.340
greatest artists filmmakers writers
musicians and King makers the world has

29
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.180
ever seen so why do queer people have
this seemingly innate Drive

30
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.739
to exemplify perfection
if you've been close to queer creators

31
00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.819
you'll know what I'm talking about
there's a need to push boundaries break

32
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.840
molds and go above and beyond what
everyone else in their field is doing

33
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.220
were show-offs because we have to be so
why do we feel like we have to be why

34
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.739
isn't good enough
good enough when that's perfectly fine

35
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.519
for 90 of the population who wants to be
good enough

36
00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:55.459
when you can be perfect
[Music]

37
00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.379
Black Swan is a 2010 Darren Aronofsky
film starring Natalie Portman which

38
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.120
skyrocketed her to the status of one of
the generation's greatest actresses

39
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.299
she'd come a long way from Star Wars and
Mars Attacks this also is probably

40
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.340
Darren aronofsky's signature film in
spite of it bearing a striking

41
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.500
similarity to the Japanese animated film
perfect blue both in content and

42
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.540
aesthetic would have been easy enough to
say yeah I saw perfect blue and really

43
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.259
wanted to do my own take on it but with
a New York ballet troop but there was a

44
00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.380
rigamaru for a long time where Aronofsky
denied having even ever seen it because

45
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.320
ego I guess the primary separation
between the two pictures is black Swan's

46
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.540
focus on camera work and Natalie
Portman's performance Black Swan lost

47
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.660
the best picture Academy Award to The
King's Speech I would have been more

48
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.900
than comfortable if it had gone to
either Black Swan or The Social Network

49
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.820
that year but instead I had to cringe my
way through another important period

50
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.860
piece imagery and themes from Black Swan
remain media relevant even over a decade

51
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.639
later
it's likely that unlike even The Social

52
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.220
Network Black Swan will persist as a
generation defining film for the

53
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.479
Hollywood Vault because certainly nobody
really remembers The King's Speech and

54
00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.500
aside from Portman's home run
performance as walking panic attack Nina

55
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.419
the Prima ballerina the ongoing
reverence for the film suggests there is

56
00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.940
far more to it how does this film speak
to the people who continue to hold on to

57
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.560
it Nina is the daughter of a single
mother and former ballet dancer whose

58
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.759
career had to get tucked away to raise
her daughter it's unclear if Nina's

59
00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.440
excellence in dance is something she
wanted or if it's something her mother

60
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.460
pushed her into Nina is over parented
and locked in a state of Perpetual

61
00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.100
girlhood we do have an indication that
Nina's sexuality is at least fluid her

62
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.840
sexual interest in Jacques seems to be
more about proving a point to him and

63
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.419
her sexual interest in Lily could be
more of an act of rebellion I swear

64
00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.740
there's an entire Ace or pansexual paper
that you could write about the implicit

65
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.759
sexuality of Nina I'm inclined to say
that her queerness is not indicative of

66
00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.560
the plot but
her uncomfortable sexual attraction and

67
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.560
or sexual indifference to others and
herself is underlying the whole film The

68
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.199
Girl is confused Nina also likely lives
with undiagnosed psychosis nowhere in

69
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.280
the film is this explicitly stated
though the audience is given this

70
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.419
impression through hallucinations and
gaps in her perception

71
00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.740
she consistently sees her face on other
girls who look similar to her which

72
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.479
given that this is a New York ballet
troupe is almost everyone in her

73
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.620
immediate circle she possesses a number
of psychological ticks when Under

74
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.460
Pressure she scratches and picks at her
skin

75
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.259
somehow picking off a hangnail is one of
the most unsettling moments of body

76
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:12.600
Horror in cinema history which is part
of why this film struck so hard peeling

77
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.500
back a hangnail and accidentally ripping
off your finger is something I'm sure

78
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.880
we've all been afraid of at some point
and if you haven't I hope you're

79
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.080
enjoying your mental health her ballet
troop is lagging in audience attendance

80
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.699
and in order to cycle more butts into
seats The Troop director Jacques decides

81
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.599
to cycle out their former Prima
ballerina Beth to Mark the

82
00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.639
reinvigoration of the troop season he is
staging a reimagined and streamlined

83
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:44.580
performance of Swan Lake Nina is
selected to take Beth's position after a

84
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.020
questionable audition process sussing
some of the bite out of the timid

85
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.699
sheltered girl Jacques struggles to
translate that onto stage Nina's

86
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.080
meticulous obsession with structure and
factory-made Poise he feels blocks her

87
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.960
from truly embodying the raw and
seductive Passion of the Black Swan the

88
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.979
story of the ballet follows Prince
Siegfried who is given his father's

89
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:13.560
blessing to go on one last Bachelor stag
Bender before having to select a

90
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.940
candidate for betrothal boys right while
on a hunting trip with his friends he

91
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.460
encounters a glorious Swan though just
as he takes aim the sun drops below the

92
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.020
Horizon and the swan transforms into a
beautiful woman she tells him that she

93
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.360
is Princess Odette who angered the
wicked Sorcerer rothbard And was cursed

94
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.860
to live her daylight hours as a swan and
that only true love could break this

95
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.599
curse the two dance and talk all night
and quickly begin to feel a budding

96
00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:45.959
Romance
but before Siegfried could confess his

97
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:51.000
feelings odette's swantaraj finds her
and whisks her away from what they feel

98
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.680
could be the dangerous false promise of
affection Siegfried returns to his

99
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.240
castle and demands his servants return
to the lake to secure the swan for upon

100
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.160
Nightfall he shall give his promises to
her his parents naturally hesitant call

101
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.560
upon a number of other ladies regardless
and all the night is spent dancing and

102
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.480
celebrating but when The Swan Princess
arrives All Eyes fall upon her this

103
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.459
version of Odette favors black and not
only seduces Siegfried but enchants the

104
00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.660
entire court and it is not until
Siegfried offers her his hand in

105
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.100
marriage and the whole of nobility
offers their blessing that she reveals

106
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.500
herself to be Odelay the daughter of
rothbart and his student in sorcery

107
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.480
Siegfried rushes to Odette whose heart
is broken knowing how easy it was to

108
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.820
avert his gaze from her there are
several endings to Swan Lake most of

109
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.160
them are tragic but with varying degrees
yes you get the one where Siegfried

110
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.820
renews his affections for Odette and
their love overpowers rothbart's magic

111
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:59.820
but Tchaikovsky had no hand in that most
endings revolve around Odette taking her

112
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.680
own life as with the ballets ending in
Black Swan sometimes one or both of the

113
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.480
men die sometimes Odette is forced to
live as a swan forever sometimes her

114
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.740
death breaks the spell and she chooses
to leave Siegfried behind the key

115
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.920
feature of the ballet is the performance
of both the Swan Queen and the Black

116
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.720
Swan two very different roles often
Danced by the same dancer and how a

117
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.399
dancer portrays either character can
make a significant difference to how the

118
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:34.680
audience feels about the production dual
roles like these were not often used on

119
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.860
stage and if it wasn't done right it
could come across as very gimmicky Black

120
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:46.079
Swan draws many parallels to the
Tchaikovsky ballet but various elements

121
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:51.839
are subverted and there is a question of
which character is which is Jacques the

122
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:56.279
Gallant Prince Siegfried meant to rescue
Nina from her sheltered life

123
00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:02.579
or is he the devious rothbart who turns
a princess into a swan out of pure spite

124
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:07.560
while it may seem apparent that co-star
Mila Kunis's character Lily is the Black

125
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.720
Swan Nina's journey is for herself to
become the Black Swan and there is a

126
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.120
suggestion that Lily is not as devious
as Nina May perceive her is Nina a Swan

127
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.339
Queen transforming into the Black Swan
or is she a Black Swan merely

128
00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:28.920
masquerading as a Swan Queen
the film calls to attention Nina's quest

129
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.440
for Perfection and exactly what that
means well it's no secret that she may

130
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.180
be the best technical dancer in the
troupe she lacks the Finesse and freedom

131
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.500
that the director is looking for but
shouldn't this itself qualify as

132
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.959
Perfection if her movement and grace are
so archetypal it wouldn't look as good

133
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:54.839
if it came out of a factory
how can you criticize someone for being

134
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.800
too good

135
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.519
what isn't explicitly called to
attention in the film is the pragmatic

136
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:10.320
side the business side of dance because
art and culture or not these shows need

137
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.459
to make money at least to break even
because these performances are heavily

138
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:19.320
subsidized by Municipal cultural
initiatives but there is still the ego

139
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.579
of drawing in a crowd can we say that
the bulk of the audience needed to make

140
00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:27.540
these shows a success would actively
understand the differences between Nina

141
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.920
and Lily's portrayal of the Black Swan
some of the audience would naturally the

142
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.320
dancers would also but the vast majority
of show goers would not understand the

143
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.480
Nuance that would go into a different
portrayal is Jacques degree of scrutiny

144
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.639
that necessary it's not a shock to
extrapolate that a major theme of this

145
00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:53.220
film is opening a discourse about dance
in general ballet being particularly

146
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.779
toxic the reason why dancers really only
have a career into their late 20s is

147
00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:01.800
because the human body dissolves into a
yarn ball of pain after forcing your

148
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.519
muscles to move like this women
especially develop degenerative foot

149
00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:10.860
problems and sometimes will simply stop
growing toenails due to the demand on

150
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.660
Dancing On Point
which men can rarely do the psychology

151
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.820
of dance is also incredibly destructive
Eating Disorders being among the least

152
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.700
severe consequences if you are cast as a
swan a director will treat you like an

153
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.620
animal favoritism is given toward the
stars and as with Nina the director's

154
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.420
favor is not always a boon
and Black Swan does poke at the culture

155
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.320
of sexual abuse and coercion in the
industry as well it is in question

156
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.040
whether Jacques is using his position to
leverage sexual favors out of hundreds

157
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.899
of beautiful girls who will do anything
for the part alternately he may be

158
00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:56.820
earnestly employing
unorthodox and slightly unethical

159
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:03.060
techniques to suss the most out of his
dancers but what is clear is that what

160
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.220
Jacques wants out of Nina is everything
she could possibly have to give the

161
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.440
individual is second compared to what
she can afford to the show The Troop and

162
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.079
most importantly his reputation it's not
in question that Jacques is manipulative

163
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:23.339
and emotionally abusive but for girls
who have dedicated their lives and

164
00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:26.880
bodies to ballet
what are they going to do

165
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.440
get another job as demonstrated by
Nina's mother having a baby is a career

166
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.079
killer what other value do these girls
have if not to devote their entire

167
00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:42.420
existence to Excellence and just how far
will they be pushed to meet those

168
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.760
demands what do they have to be to even
get noticed in the first place

169
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.959
what does Perfection really mean what
needs to be sacrificed for Perfection

170
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:57.060
why is perfection important to Nina and
most importantly why is perfection the

171
00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.339
bare minimum requirement for her Nina
finds herself in a state of existence

172
00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:06.600
where if she's not the best then there's
just no point to her

173
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.639
this is absolutely fostered in part by
her mother whose simultaneous greatest

174
00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:16.560
pride and deepest fear is that Nina will
surpass her potential if her mother was

175
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.240
going to sacrifice her career for Nina
something she is regularly reminded of

176
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.000
the Nina Needs to make that worth it and
naturally this is doubled down by the

177
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.579
aforementioned work environment and yet
to us gays we love Black Swan by the way

178
00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:38.519
to us gays we are drawn to this movie
Beyond just standing Natalie Portman and

179
00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:43.320
Beyond just the magnetic draw to tragic
yet fabulous women there's a question

180
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.820
about why we would feel such a kindred
sense of belonging with a movie about

181
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:54.540
how abusive the dance industry is what
drives Nina's quest for Perfection it's

182
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.760
something that can easily be dismissed
as a compulsion due to her clear

183
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.740
untreated mental health issues
but the not so Secret Message of Black

184
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:10.380
Swan is that the environment of dance is
so toxic that the Perfection is a matter

185
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.699
of survival if Perfection is not the
goal if you treat this as a nine-to-five

186
00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:19.740
job if your life health and whole being
are not dedicated to not only meeting

187
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.579
expectations but blasting them out of
the water

188
00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:28.260
then what are you even doing here there
are hundreds of other girls who can tow

189
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.639
the line what makes you so special
granted in this environment Perfection

190
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:37.860
isn't a sliding scale
it's a matter of who fits what for which

191
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.699
purpose bearing in mind that Lily wasn't
even in consideration for the role of

192
00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:45.360
the Swan Queen in the first place but
her light-hearted demonstrations and

193
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.940
rehearsals filled in the blanks that
Nina was leaving behind suddenly because

194
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.519
Lily can do what Nina struggles with
she seems perfect and make no mistake in

195
00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:00.779
the world of ballet Details Matter the
script isn't being flippant when it

196
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:06.000
highlights just how nuanced Nina's
movements need to be to make the cut to

197
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.780
this end many Productions of Swan Lake
make cast a different dancer for Odette

198
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.780
and her doppelganger Odelay a thought
that never crosses Jacques mind but

199
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.559
where would the world of art and culture
be if directors just did the easy thing

200
00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:25.079
besides in Productions of the ballet
both Odette and Odelay are on stage so

201
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.760
little splitting the role in two would
defeat the purpose of a prima ballerina

202
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.679
historically the role of the Swan Queen
is one of the most coveted Center Stage

203
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:40.260
who is she roles in all of Dance
splitting the role may as well be

204
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.400
sharing the spotlight and for girls who
have sacrificed their lives and stepped

205
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.280
on whoever they needed to to get here
that is not a compliment what Nina

206
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.039
represents is a version of perfection
but her version is only suited for half

207
00:17:56.039 --> 00:18:00.360
the role so she may as well be garbage
rather than compliment Nina for her

208
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.280
strengths she is criticized for having
any flaws at all Black Swan offers a

209
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.780
suggestion of what it takes to
experience perfection

210
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.480
the individual must disappear when you
have a collection of young men and women

211
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.100
who exist in a career field where family
and social lives often interfere with

212
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.299
work demands
why not demand the best it's not like

213
00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:27.419
they have anyone to go home and cook
dinner for with nothing else in their

214
00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:32.400
lives going on why not demand Perfection
but the question I have about this is

215
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.419
whether we're putting the cart before
the horse is perfection demanded of

216
00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:41.039
those who do not have any life outside
of their work or do these incredibly

217
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:46.260
demanding yet prestigious careers
attract people who have nothing else to

218
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:52.320
live for
or rather for those who choose

219
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.000
to have nothing else to live for

220
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.140
existing within queer circles I've
noticed that there can be

221
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.179
a great deal expected of us what can we
contribute to society if we're not going

222
00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:18.360
to be birthing the subsequent generation
queer artists usually rise above their

223
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.299
contemporaries and are celebrated as the
movers and shakers as the voices of

224
00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.210
their day and age
at least

225
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.860
[Music]
until a plague wipes them out or

226
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.600
they're outed at which point nobody
wants anything to do with us

227
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.100
historically at least even outside of
Art

228
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:47.039
we have been found leading the world of
business and politics bringing new

229
00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:52.200
insights and perspectives again and
again

230
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.840
until we're outed and for those who
enter these worlds here and queer and

231
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.679
not able to hide it
not only do they have to work harder to

232
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:09.720
overcome social and institutional
roadblocks

233
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:16.440
but it's not enough to toe the line
they have to make history or they're not

234
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.059
worth mentioning
in history for instance when we talk

235
00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:28.620
about CEOs running gigantic companies we
talk about Bezos or musk or Zuckerberg

236
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.220
we never talk about
Tim Cook

237
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.880
the out gay CEO of Apple who oversaw the
company literally having more cash on

238
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.980
hand than the United States government
at one point ever since queer acceptance

239
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.620
among parents began to catch on the
level of pressure for us to produce

240
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.860
adopted or surrogate grandchildren
has reached pandemic levels

241
00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:02.340
whereas before it was very common to cut
ties with intolerant families or for

242
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.660
tolerant families to understand the
familial limitations afforded to gay

243
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:12.260
couples and individuals perhaps our
queer striving for Perfection has

244
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:19.380
derived from a sense of spite
rather than guilt if I cannot earn my

245
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:26.760
parents Pride I will make them rule
their decision to disown me but now it's

246
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:32.820
if I cannot continue my family's
bloodline I will give my family name a

247
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.500
legacy what the hell is this house of
the Dragon perhaps these sentiments are

248
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.200
how this cultural attitude towards queer
exceptionalism began but I'm not sure

249
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:49.020
we've rationalize it like that anymore
but if we are like Nina queer or queer

250
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.179
adjacent as she is
is there a striving to be the best at

251
00:21:54.179 --> 00:22:01.020
what we do a compulsion or a fostered
behavior surely there are many queer

252
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.380
people who find themselves perfectly
comfortable

253
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.559
in a good home with a companion perhaps
even children even pets if they're lucky

254
00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:14.159
my landlord still won't let me have a
dog

255
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:18.059
salty about that these queers have
resolved to live a happy life

256
00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:23.159
as that branch manager and live out
their Legacy by passing it on to their

257
00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:28.020
children there are also a number of
queer people who are comfortable with

258
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.179
meager of survival having left behind
traumas and troubles in their youth

259
00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:36.600
they're fine doing the best that they
can

260
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:42.360
and just happy to not be hated by the
people closest to them to say nothing of

261
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:49.260
those who live with debilitating
psychological or physical disabilities

262
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:56.940
and for whom survival itself is a
struggle for them tends across the board

263
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.720
is a bit cruelly unrealistic but it's
that attitude 10 10 10 10 across the

264
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.340
board which originated from within our
community found in the underground

265
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.720
ballrooms fashioned from derelict and
abandoned corners of heavily populated

266
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.539
Urban spaces
tucked away where the idol passerby

267
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:23.159
would not notice
this attitude that a single nine

268
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:30.539
is an ugly smudge upon your reputation
these attitudes developed within our

269
00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:36.360
community and were present I imagine
long before the ballroom Queens of Poes

270
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.919
built their houses to provide surrogate
families to Lost queer children for

271
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:45.539
there were always the likes of Oscar
Wilde and Tchaikovsky the former worked

272
00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:50.940
himself nearly to death even before his
criminal sentence so that he could

273
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.340
project the illusion
of a lavish Gentleman of Leisure and

274
00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.480
Tchaikovsky lived with debilitating
depression his entire life Tchaikovsky

275
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.880
especially pushed for that unattainable
goal of perfection and while he is now

276
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.860
one of the most celebrated composers of
the western musical Canon during his own

277
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.320
lifetime there was question about
whether he was or was not

278
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.080
a western composer during his time his
home nation of Russia was desperately

279
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.000
disconnected from the rest of Europe a
strange mix of Slavic honey and

280
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.220
Mongolian with a Sprinkle of exotic
Traditions like Christian Orthodoxy

281
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:38.280
Russia was an alien place to most of
Europe it took german-born Catherine the

282
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:45.840
Great to introduce European ideas to the
motherland there is a mild case to argue

283
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.720
that Tchaikovsky
did the inverse unlike other Russian

284
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.100
composers Tchaikovsky adopted European
traditionalism into his compositions

285
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.919
among audiences his music seemed exotic
enough to be enticing yet familiar

286
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:08.400
enough to be recognizable and very very
sad to the extent that today like David

287
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.900
Bowie or the Rolling Stones you've
probably heard a Tchaikovsky Melody even

288
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:21.259
if you don't know that's what it is
[Music]

289
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.200
unfortunately for him this put pieta in
an uncomfortable position critically

290
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.980
despite the fact that he introduced
Russian conventions into European music

291
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.700
Paving the way for musical giants like
Stravinsky for the time however

292
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.799
Tchaikovsky was in an uncomfortable
middle Zone Russian Scholars lampooned

293
00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:44.700
him for distancing himself from
traditional Russian conventions European

294
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.539
scholars felt that he did not follow
European standards enough to be

295
00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:53.039
intellectually elevated that isn't to
say that he did not have allies in

296
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:56.820
either group mind you who lauded his
ability to present Russian Aesthetics

297
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:02.279
without resorting to gaulish exoticism
while being accessible to westerners

298
00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:05.820
ironically Swan Lake was considered a
failure when it premiered get this

299
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.500
critics felt the original score was too
complex to function as ballet

300
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.400
accompaniment imagine completely
Shifting the culture of music and

301
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.720
performance art and everyone around you
shrugs and says

302
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.720
mid to complex Jesus meanwhile
heterosexual and precursor Nazi Richard

303
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.880
Wagner was over there making a dog and
pony show out of morbid complexity and

304
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:37.479
getting lauded for it
[Music]

305
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.600
it's the worst when hateful people
actually make good art at the very least

306
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.320
it puts him in the camp of other
composers who produced pieces of music

307
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.260
that were
initially

308
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.200
poorly received which then went on to
influence the future of composition

309
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.039
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring

310
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.679
debussy's symphonic sketches of the sea

311
00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:08.840
orbizets Carmen

312
00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:15.720
and the entire career of Hector berlios
who's so underrated he doesn't even get

313
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.329
the last name treatment
[Music]

314
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:32.700
Tchaikovsky was never openly gay
though there were rumors that he had to

315
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.159
dodge for most of his adult life but as
a Russian trying to produce music for a

316
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:42.480
European audience
he was an outsider nevertheless and when

317
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.539
people see you as an outsider
there's an immediate barrier

318
00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:53.400
they put before you some qualifications
of otherness are just more visible but I

319
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.900
hear this echoed within the queer
Community to an absurd degree these

320
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.659
barriers and hurdles and expectations
ranging from public speaking contests in

321
00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:08.460
high school local craft competitions to
watching professionals and Publishing

322
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.140
television and other forms of media
people who go out on a limb and break

323
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:18.380
the mold and then have their bold
advancements parroted by a more

324
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.860
conventional creator
who's then credited with flipping the

325
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.299
script or moderately successful gay
YouTube creators who get left on red by

326
00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:31.980
nebula I feel that perhaps we
overcompensate for our need to provide

327
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:37.980
ourselves with Legacy we push the limits
a bit further than our Scholars and

328
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:43.440
corporate overlords are willing to
recognize perhaps because we seek Legacy

329
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.240
and Perfection for its own sake or
rather like Nina

330
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.380
some
internalized compulsion we judge the

331
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:59.159
Merit of our craft and art upon its own
values rather than the values of the

332
00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:04.740
establishment the objective of that
generally being this needs to sell this

333
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.400
isn't to say that queer people own a
monopoly on perfectionism

334
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.980
Beethoven and Mozart are also considered
perfect however for every Mozart there

335
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:20.159
were 10 nasaliaries who were
okay but they were not Wolfgang Amadeus

336
00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:23.820
Mozart whereas what queer composers can
you think of a difficult question

337
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.960
provided that being closeted makes a lot
of this analysis difficult

338
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:34.679
but when it comes to hearsay there were
rumors abound of either Chopin Or List

339
00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:40.440
given that they were both Divas who
could put Mariah to shame this may very

340
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.159
well check out

341
00:29:45.899 --> 00:29:49.740
both of them are concerned
oh gods

342
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:55.380
a gold standard of admission to music
programs with a piano Focus around the

343
00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.659
world it always comes back to Divas
which points to the lingering question

344
00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:04.140
at hand
do queer people

345
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:11.700
possess an internalized Perfection
complex or are we naturally drawn to

346
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.320
Artistic fields that favor presentation
and provided that those without families

347
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.360
often thrive in fields or tangential to
show business

348
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.000
is this where we find ourselves at home
and in Creative Fields especially the

349
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.820
best of the best have their pick
those in demand will always work

350
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.140
that even second or third from the best
May struggle that's why the queer

351
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:42.419
Community will lift up the barely
talented queers who manage to get the

352
00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:47.340
attention of the straight masses the
Ellens and Pete's this visibility had

353
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.740
been a token of hope that perhaps times
were changing for our history of living

354
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.299
in the shadows the queer person who
makes history

355
00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:03.059
they were the exception to the rule the
rule being that the world could do

356
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:07.080
without us
however the developing landscape of

357
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:13.440
queer rights has afforded other venues
of success to queer individuals and

358
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.200
sadly
it is not greater access to success

359
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:27.120
[Music]
there remains an uncomfortable pattern

360
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.279
for what queer people need to do to be
considered contributive members of

361
00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:36.539
society that is for those who chose not
to conform to the heteronormative

362
00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:39.659
nuclear family pattern of raising
children

363
00:31:39.659 --> 00:31:45.120
it seems strange to me that causing a
cultural shift in pop music or theater

364
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.720
or film is celebrated on par with Frank
and Bob getting married and approved for

365
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.580
adoption they're seen as almost just as
remarkable if you can't do one or the

366
00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.480
other
what use are you this is a strange

367
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:07.919
precedent for our conditional acceptance
we must conform to the hegemonistic

368
00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:13.080
system of Game of Life Milestones to
justify our ability to earn

369
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:20.039
our human rights or we must become an
icon of success to qualify as a

370
00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:24.960
mold-breaking exception to the blanket
attitude about queer people isn't it

371
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.840
strange that a simple
relatively unremarkable milestone for a

372
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.179
straight person is now hailed as proof
positive of queer success but where do

373
00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:41.940
we go after gay marriage in our lives
it's unclear because simply living a

374
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.779
heteronormative life is regarded as a
kind of success

375
00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:50.700
as if the more of us enlist in domestic
life the greater message we are sending

376
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:57.659
to the CIS hetero hegemony that we do in
fact deserve the same that they do which

377
00:32:57.659 --> 00:33:02.880
is a bleak way to look at it sure
again

378
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.799
different floats for different boats but
the Straits complain incessantly about

379
00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:12.240
home life being the death of personal
ambition

380
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.820
say nothing of autonomy and they have
the benefit of centuries of media

381
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.980
providing a range of marital Expressions
it seems that there's all this talk

382
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:28.980
Among The Straits about what qualifies
as a successful marriage but in queer

383
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:34.019
circles the success of marriage seems to
be

384
00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:38.640
getting married in the first place but
there's that success word again

385
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.519
and once more it seems to be an
inscription rather than a quality of

386
00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:50.039
what's what and for the married gays
watching this I am curious

387
00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:53.340
do you feel more pressure to remain
together

388
00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.679
than you see among your heterosexual
counterparts on the playground there is

389
00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:05.039
an indication once more
that success is a burying value

390
00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:10.320
depending upon who it is describing one
would think that success would be the

391
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.919
same for both groups gay and straight
marriages

392
00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:19.260
but I don't think it is it's like
qualifying a drag queen on the success

393
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.000
of Lady Gaga
comparatively Bianca Del Rio or Trixie

394
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.800
Mattel have nothing and yet they're
considered to be the icons of drag

395
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.240
success at least the ones who don't
Frack whereas Stephanie has her good

396
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.919
years and some off ones but again
what is success

397
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:43.320
and is it the same
as Perfection like any resource success

398
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.800
gains value the more unattainable it is
but only to a point if nobody feels

399
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:55.379
successful then it can't be used as a
gauge for qualifying one's life or more

400
00:34:55.379 --> 00:34:59.400
importantly
if success is unattainable

401
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.200
then it can't be used as a Sword of
Damocles to Lord over people and

402
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.099
convince them that accounting is a
perfectly fulfilling vocation and maybe

403
00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:12.000
it is for some
certainly pays well with the right

404
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.280
certifications but being an accountant
is a Surefire way to have people call

405
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:24.359
you successful in a way that being a
truck driver is not regardless of some

406
00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:28.920
who genuinely do find truck driving to
be the preferable fulfilling lifestyle

407
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.619
even if someone does have everything
they need from that career and life why

408
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:39.900
the reticence to say that they are
successful regardless if they themselves

409
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.760
feel like they have succeeded if success
is neither a Feeling

410
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.380
nor a self-qualification

411
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.180
what is it how does success transfer to
different careers to different groups of

412
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.940
people and for the sake of argument
how does queerness fit into it queer

413
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:05.579
people after all struggle to find our
place in contemporary society and even

414
00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:10.440
in schools of practice or stereotypes
say we belong

415
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:18.900
like theater movies art culture dance
we still struggle to find visibility

416
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.220
using Janelle Monae as an example
listening to her discography it is

417
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.720
abundantly apparent that she was never
in the closet she made a song about how

418
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.300
great vaginas were and it was initially
read as female empowerment nobody really

419
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.560
got the message until she explicitly
said the words hey I'm kind of totally

420
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.680
bisexual
and people wonder why we shove our

421
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.359
sexuality in everyone's faces because
you will literally refuse to see us if

422
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:48.420
we don't
and in spite of the fact that among her

423
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:54.480
fans she is lauded as the it girl for a
modern revitalization of music

424
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.740
in conjunction with the fact that 80's
icon Prince thought she was the greatest

425
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.839
thing since jam on toast her musical
career is frequently overlooked and even

426
00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:09.780
though her style is hallmarked by a
blend of rockabilly Soul r b and disco

427
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:16.200
credit for disco revitalization is often
given to Dua Lipa who didn't start

428
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.740
producing music until years later but
Monet

429
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:27.300
is a queer black woman
endures additional roadblocks to her own

430
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.359
success in spite of her intrinsic need
to produce top-tier art show business

431
00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:39.599
has only so many seats available it
seems and less so for entertainers who

432
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:44.280
are outside the privileged hegemonys
expectations

433
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.440
is Monet driven to Excellence because
that's simply where the bar for her

434
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.359
connoisseur ship rests or does she have
to work that much harder and produce

435
00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:58.859
content that much better than the
competition who can pass with mediocre

436
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:03.660
material perhaps the culture's tolerable
awareness for women of color in genre

437
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.780
music is so narrow that the only way to
truly break the mold

438
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.460
is to break through it just like seeking
the favor of an indifferent director by

439
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.140
tormenting yourself with impossible
standards just to watch him look the

440
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.859
other way
what kind of life is that what does that

441
00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:29.780
do to someone well
living among gay men I find we can be

442
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:35.160
excruciatingly catty with each other
demanding unrealistic ideals to the

443
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.900
point of being rude and cruel
I see groups within the queer Community

444
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:45.839
turn on each other on a dime for not
being exemplars of queer Justice it

445
00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:50.640
seems we set our own bar very high we
must have the best bodies and anyone not

446
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.020
spending at least four days a week at
the gym need not be invited to the club

447
00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.599
we must have the best marriages inside
the best cookie cutter houses and our

448
00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:05.520
children must go to the best exclusive
preschools even if we need to take out a

449
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:12.780
loan to get them there our depictions in
fiction are lofty moralistic idealistic

450
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:18.900
and ethical to a fault messy queers are
few and far between and always

451
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:24.780
criticized with
giving the lgbtq community a bad name

452
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.160
but this model of perfection we're
holding ourselves up to is one that as I

453
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.920
mentioned is a mere standard of life for
straight people the cultural drive to

454
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:40.020
push us into this nuclear model is one
which might diminish us

455
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.260
just like straight people who give up on
their dreams of being the next David

456
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.240
Bowie because their family pressures
them into getting a real job I think

457
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.440
it's only partially true
when they say that we have to put on

458
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:57.960
good appearances to impress The Straits
and to justify that we deserve the same

459
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:04.140
rights they do I feel we have
internalized our own neurotic Perfection

460
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:14.280
we can't be just like the straights
we must be better than them in every way

461
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.240
we need

462
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.220
to be perfect

463
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:32.579
[Music]
suppose that this is a manifestation of

464
00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:37.079
privilege I mean it is but this is one
that you wouldn't think about a lot of

465
00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:41.700
elements of privilege have to be
experienced in order to truly understand

466
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.720
them
it's why the privileged are so ready to

467
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.099
deny that privilege exists they may say
well

468
00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:55.320
everyone has been under pressure now and
then but it's not the same as existing

469
00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.060
in that atmosphere all the time
especially from an early age constant

470
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:05.520
exposure to these expectations Force
changes in our behavior and thinking

471
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.040
privilege also means having the choice
to separate oneself from this

472
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.760
environment of expectations so sure
there are times when we are all expected

473
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.619
to push ourselves beyond what we believe
we are capable of but

474
00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:28.440
there are some of us for whom that's the
only way we can be seen at all

475
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:34.440
especially when our only real world
icons are exemplars of performance art

476
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.940
and perfection
not every queer performer can be Freddie

477
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:44.579
Mercury if that's the gold standard for
what a queer performer needs to be to be

478
00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:49.320
held up alongside
Taylor Swift

479
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:55.140
then we're just not going to be
represented and this is our struggle

480
00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.119
with representation in fiction we are
often held as exceptional to the point

481
00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:06.200
of tokenism because you shouldn't have
to be the absolute best at what you do

482
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.880
in order to be visible because there's
only one person who can be the best at

483
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.859
something and it goes for queer people
as it does for people of color or even

484
00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:20.520
Independent Women who don't want
children if being the best at something

485
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.800
is the only way that the hegemony is
willing to recognize our talent

486
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.560
then there are thousands if not millions
of queer or people of color

487
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:36.119
or women
who will be completely ignored next to

488
00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:40.980
the privileged masses you shouldn't need
to be perfect

489
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:46.260
to be seen
you shouldn't need to feel perfect

490
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:52.140
to be valuable considering what many of
us have gone through in life

491
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:58.020
I think still being here
is exceptional enough

492
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.180
your name may not be in lights yet but
someone knows who you are

493
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:09.960
someone cares about you
someone wants to see you succeed

494
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.180
the Black Swan inside you is only ever
going to hold you down hold you back

495
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.800
even if others insist
that that's the only valuable thing

496
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.260
about you
but you don't need her

497
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:32.300
when you can be the Swan Queen
you were born to be

498
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.899
[Applause]

499
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.330
[Applause]

500
00:43:58.330 --> 00:45:07.840
[Music]

501
00:45:10.099 --> 00:45:13.099
thank you
