00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.240
this video is brought to you by
Lilo I want to be absolutely clear

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.040
upfront so that you can be very assured
where my intentions are going forward I

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.320
do not dislike any of the media that
we're talking about in this video in

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.439
fact I loved most of it on the page and
the screen I'm not coming for any of the

5
00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.840
creators this time but we do need to
talk about this because there is clearly

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.400
an issue here and it's becoming a
problem but the issue doesn't really

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.960
have a clear Target to blame
so let's hit the ground running and talk

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.520
about red white and royal blue the
recently released movie based on the

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.600
book by Casey mcquiston in the heart of
the city of London The Majestic Wedding

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.960
Bells Echo announcing the matrimony of
Prince Phillip the eldest grandson of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.079
England's Monarch the historic streets
lined with iconic landmarks Buzz with

12
00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.559
anticipation and excitement among the
swirl of dignitaries and celebrities is

13
00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.120
an individual who attracts attention
like a moth to a flame Alex Claremont d

14
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.920
as he isn't just any attendee he's the
dynamic son of Ellen Claremont a

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.400
Trailblazer who shattered glass ceilings
by becoming the first woman to become

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.720
the president of the United States
however this evening amidst the

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.280
sparkling chandeliers of the Grand
Ballroom something is a miss the air

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.400
thickens with tension and hush Whispers
Traverse the room at the heart of these

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.759
murmurs are Alex and Prince Henry the
younger sibling of the groom their

20
00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.079
contentious relationship is the stuff of
social media Legend the simmering

21
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.920
animosity between them reaches its
Crescendo when a relatively minor

22
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.360
misunderstanding leads to them swimming
and wedding cake providing juicy content

23
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.280
for the eager tabloids on both sides of
the pond the repercussions are immediate

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.159
with the impending reelection campaign
of President Claremont the Scandal is

25
00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.399
ill timed threatening to put a dent in
her electoral armor damage control is of

26
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.040
the essence to smooth out ruffled
feathers and plate the media's appetite

27
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.479
for Scandal Alex and Henry are thrust
into a meticulously orchestrated PR

28
00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.320
campaign
this facade aimed at showcasing their

29
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.880
renewed friendship has them attending
events posing for pictures and offering

30
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.640
sound bites about their brotherly Bond
what three words would I use to describe

31
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.200
Henry white blonde and British during
one such contrived rendevu after a

32
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280
security breach lands them both locked
in a cramped broom closet Alex's guard

33
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.560
crumbles he divulges the root of his
resentment stemming from a slate he felt

34
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.519
from Henry during one of his initial
forays in to the international stage

35
00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.760
this heartfelt confession laced with
vulnerability moves Henry recognizing

36
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.680
the weight of the misunderstanding he
extends a genuine gesture of

37
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.959
reconciliation late night texts replace
tur exchanges humor replaces hostility

38
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.280
and slowly they start to build a bond
peppered with light-hearted Jabs and

39
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.400
shared inside jokes however
relationships are rarely linear at the

40
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.159
extravagant New Year celebration hosted
by Alex emotions bubble to the surface

41
00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.400
when the clock strikes midnight a
buoyant Alex loses es himself in the

42
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.000
festivities this does not sit well with
the Prince Henry's sudden and

43
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.599
unexplained departure hints at unspoken
sentiments driven by an overwhelming

44
00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.480
fear of maybe losing Henry Alex seeks
him out in the Serene White House

45
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.280
Gardens confusion leads to a kiss from
the prince who like any man then spends

46
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.200
the next several weeks ignoring Alex's
texts and phone calls a normal gay

47
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.799
experience yes weeks later at a
presidential dinner Alex reunites with

48
00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.200
Henry and the pair end up hooking up the
ha enter into a Friends with Benefits

49
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.000
relationship although they keep their
involvement secret Duty and

50
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.680
responsibilities however have their own
demands the Electoral Battlefield

51
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.799
beckons and Alex finds himself in Texas
championing his mother's campaign

52
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.080
because this is a romantic fantasy the
idea of Texas voting for a Democratic

53
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.560
president is actually possible he later
travels to Brooklyn to speak at the

54
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.959
Democratic National Convention where
Henry unexpectedly visits him this leads

55
00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.799
to these friends with benefits becoming
something closer than just friends Alex

56
00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.040
even comes out to his mother as bisexual
she's very supportive maybe even too

57
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.959
supportive when she starts recommending
that he go on prep but advises him to

58
00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.239
think about his relationship carefully a
public relationship between the first

59
00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.079
son and the prince of England could
change their lives forever their story

60
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.680
however is far from a fairy tale ending
Henry visits Alex at the scen at

61
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.440
Claremont Vacation House near Austin
Texas out on the lake just when Alex is

62
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.240
on the cusp of sharing his deepest
feelings with Henry the panicked Prince

63
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.880
throws himself into the lake and soon
leaves escaping to England but love with

64
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.759
its tenacity Spurs Alex on he pursues
Henry across the ocean seeking answers

65
00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.039
drenched from the English rain Alex
demands to know why Henry has basically

66
00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.240
abandoned him Henry admits that he loves
Alex just as Alex loves him but explains

67
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.440
that his Royal position makes a gay
relationship impossible for him but Alex

68
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.919
with those eyelashes of his manages to
convince Henry that their relationship

69
00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.199
is worth fighting for and the to
reconcile and commit to being together

70
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.440
yet Destiny has more challenges waiting
in the wings their intimate emails and

71
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.240
texts a window to their evolving Love
Story are maliciously exposed by a

72
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.759
spurned x of Alex's creating a media
Maelstrom Alex uses this as an

73
00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.759
opportunity to come out publicly and own
his sexuality and his love for Henry

74
00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.000
giving a moving speech that makes him
the figurehead for queer America but

75
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.680
things don't go so well for Henry whose
family has all but sequestered him away

76
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.960
from the public at large but thanks to
some deaf maneuvering on the part of

77
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.240
allies on both sides Alex and Henry
reunite in London and prepare to

78
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.800
confront the king of England about Henry
being allowed to be his own man a tur

79
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.600
confrontation follows but is interrupted
by the sounds in the streets the public

80
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.400
have come to support Henry despite what
his family may want and going against

81
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.199
the wishes of the crown Henry chooses
Alex the climax of the story coincides

82
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.160
with the US elections polls are tight
and Alex's family is preparing for bad

83
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.560
news the only thing keeping Alex
together is is Henry by his side as his

84
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.120
mother prepares a concession speech news
comes from Texas in the most fairy tale

85
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.639
moments since Cinderella's fairy
godmother turned a pumpkin into a

86
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.680
carriage Texas goes blue securing a
second term for president Claremont

87
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.319
Alex's tireless efforts combined with
Henry's unwavering support Mark a dual

88
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.919
Victory one political and one personal
the movie ends as they celebrate away

89
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.400
from the media glare in the Tranquil
surroundings of Alex's childhood home in

90
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400
Austin

91
00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.520
so red white and royal blue might read
like The Ultimate what if scenario but

92
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.440
strip away the international diplomacy
and Royal trappings and you got yourself

93
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.280
a pretty straightforward romance two
guys falling for each other when they

94
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.759
least expect it groundbreaking now if
you're familiar with the romance genre

95
00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.800
you'll know that it's not exactly
bursting at the seams with gay love

96
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.440
stories that don't take a tragic turn
and mainstream romcoms well they've

97
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.120
historically stuck to the script of
snowflakes and sanitized kisses with the

98
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.199
steamier stuff being left implied if
it's acknowledged at all explicitly

99
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.440
sexual gay romcoms are like unicorns
mythically rare and to some potentially

100
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.240
unsettling in this narrative Alex and
Henry's all-consuming infatuation

101
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.080
anchors the plot they're the kind of
into to deep that has them gambling

102
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.720
everything on a chance at happiness and
sure with Alex's mom in full campaign

103
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.680
mode and Henry sporting a crown usually
metaphorically their romance isn't

104
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.879
exactly public friendly but the
fireworks happen offstage their text

105
00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.639
messages a master class in building
sexual tension and their together

106
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.240
moments well let's just say they're
explosive in the clutch of pearls kind

107
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.199
of way especially in the book they make
up for lost time as it were the story

108
00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.199
kind of saunters into this linal space
it's not pure handholding puppy love

109
00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.080
like in heartstopper but it's also not
quite at the level of pay-per-view

110
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.240
eroticism that you'd find an elite it's
sweet sure endearing even to the most

111
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.720
cynical of us but it also packs enough
Heat to make you want to crack open a

112
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.840
window my full name is Henry George
Edward James Hanover Stewart

113
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.479
foog and I thought Alexander Gabriel
Claremont Diaz was a

114
00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:17.840
mouthful he
is and yet got some heat of the not so

115
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.520
great kind uh we're talking about think
pieces from places like The Huffington

116
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.720
Post and the BBC getting their knickers
in a Twist over the movie's excessive

117
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.639
sexiness The
Twist some of these nay ERS were gay men

118
00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.360
it's a bit of a the call is coming from
inside of the house moment when queer

119
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.519
people themselves openly admit to being
comfortable watching straight sex in

120
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:41.919
movies but are turned away by the sight
of boys kissing especially due to how

121
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.440
relatively tame red white and Royal
Blue's sex was compared to other gay

122
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.399
media released in recent memory the bulk
of criticism however was found on social

123
00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:53.480
media where straight people seemed to be
confused and shocked that gay men had

124
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.880
sex at all the references and
the one particular sex scene which

125
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.120
seemed like a Rubik's Cube to some
straight viewers were too much for an

126
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.160
audience that had been raised on the
sexist gay best friend sidekick

127
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.000
character it's almost as if someone
asked do gay characters have sexual

128
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.560
encounters how do they do this when
they're both facing each other what kind

129
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.200
of Witchcraft is this as a result they
rush to the internet first to

130
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.399
investigate how the missionary position
could possibly work with gays and then

131
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:22.200
to express their dissatisfaction with
the situation there's a strong

132
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.120
undercurrent of hypocracy here
particularly as queer folk of literally

133
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.959
every shade of the rainbow are accused
of corrupting the youth never mind that

134
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:33.880
it was perfectly acceptable for
virtually every American Teen Movie to

135
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.200
focus with laser Precision on rooting
for teenagers to Bone each other the

136
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.560
American Pi franchise owes its whole
success to this for which audiences

137
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.040
agree that the heterosexual events in
American Pi

138
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.519
are normal but when it's gay it's
sexualization echoing a sentiment

139
00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:52.120
quietly expressed in culture straight is
normal and everything else that is

140
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.320
outside of normal must be scrutinized
for how it may corrupt the normal which

141
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.560
is the most irrational thought process
presented in this essay and I will note

142
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.160
just in casee YouTube makes me cut the
footage of said scene the main sex scene

143
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.000
in red white and royal blue entirely
focuses on faces it's all about the

144
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.440
emotional intimacy between two people
and less about the raw sex which isn't

145
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.240
even raw by the way because they make a
point of using a condom which a lot of

146
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.839
gay viewers laughed at because we're in
the age of prep but two things one

147
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.200
Prince Henry probably couldn't go on
prep without it causing a scandal and

148
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.000
two there are STDs other than HIV guys
this is why syphilis is resurging and

149
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.079
why we're getting antibiotic resistant
strains of Gonorrhea now wrap it up in

150
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:39.680
any case according to what I've gathered
the majority of viewers who were

151
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.160
offended were heterosexual women who
were apparently exposed to gay content

152
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.079
for the first time in their lives fora
heartstopper which huge props to

153
00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.959
heartstopper by the way for opening
people's minds to the concept that boy

154
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:58.519
kissing is all right but when that's
their only exposure I can understand how

155
00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:03.839
legs up anal penetration may leave them
surprised however they were so taken

156
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:08.720
back that they criticized the film for
having an excessive amount of sexual

157
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.480
content which once more is one scene and
in both a physical and figurative sense

158
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.600
it's not quite as steamy as the sex
scene that took place between Rose and

159
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.600
Jack and the car in Titanic they were
shut down online pretty quickly by a

160
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.160
huge swath of fans made up mostly of
women but to my delightful surprise a

161
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.760
lot of gay men as well who told them to
pipe down and accept that sex exists

162
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.200
thank you but for a few days this very
very vocal minority were making it seem

163
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.839
like Alex and Henry having sex in the
most basic position known to humankind

164
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.399
while using a condom and even to my
recollection being under the bed sheets

165
00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:48.000
was compared on a onetoone basis as the
third day of a meth orgy so why is it

166
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.160
that they were perfectly fine with Nick
and Charlie kissing up a storm on

167
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.200
heartstopper writing fanfiction about it
and creating countless fan edits on Tik

168
00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.279
Tok but basically formed a covenant the
minute Al pushed Henry's knees up to his

169
00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:06.639
chest I'd like to see their reaction to
well any episode of que's folk now is

170
00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:10.600
this just because they've never been
exposed to the idea of gay sex before

171
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.079
were they homophobic were they secret
prageru plants out to kill the movie

172
00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:20.720
were they sex negative in general or
have we as a society simply conditioned

173
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:28.199
a large swath of the populace to think
of gays as completely nonsexual objects

174
00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:31.399
something that plenty of people like
having around but keep it a distance

175
00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:35.880
just far enough away to not have to know
too much about it they know that men

176
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.519
have sex with men and women have sex
with women but they're really icked out

177
00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.800
by the idea of knowing the ins and outs
and tops and bottoms of it all good

178
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.440
thing Henry didn't eat any beans before
the scene or that could have brought up

179
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.480
even more uncomfortable questions the
controversy about the sex in red white

180
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.079
and royal blue while quickly suppressed
seems to paint an ill- fated Omen about

181
00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:59.240
the condition of gay men and possibly by
extension all of queerness and the

182
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.320
ability to be open about sex lives
especially in the same comfort that

183
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.519
straight creators depict straight sex
through a latent process of judging

184
00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.920
gayness in media the straight audience
can pass a stamp of approval or condemn

185
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.199
certain media and in the process we can
perhaps perceive the hetero hegemony as

186
00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:23.320
dictating how or how not to be gay and
simply by how overwhelmingly large the

187
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.959
straight audience is their dictation of
what good gay representation is drowns

188
00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:32.680
out what gay men describe as good gay
representation this is the fear anyway

189
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.399
and though I believe it is irrational
the fear comes from a very real very

190
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:41.639
valid place especially as a conservative
wave once again washes Across America

191
00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:45.880
and sections of Europe which tries to
insist that queer sex should be pushed

192
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.240
back into the closet or should simply
cease to exist altogether which is how

193
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.360
they also feel about various queer
people political gay fears seem to be

194
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.800
realized through the mass audience's
reaction to gay characters in media in

195
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.079
conjunction with criticisms against
relatively tame gay sex in one movie the

196
00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:09.000
celebration of sexless queer characters
in another piece of queer media seems to

197
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.399
Echo a 1950s abstinence mandate that
says to Modern young queer people you'll

198
00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:19.120
be accepted if you're less like the
characters in red white and royal blue

199
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.199
and more like the characters in

200
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.399
heartstopper
let's take a closer look at heartstopper

201
00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:37.160
for a moment this series skips the usual
over-the-top drama and instead captures

202
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.199
the sweet sometimes clumsy moments of
teen love it centers around two

203
00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:44.880
characters Charlie spring played by Joe
lock and Nick Nelson played by Kid

204
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.600
Connor their story takes place in a
typical English high school and unfolds

205
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.199
slowly and gently with each episode
moving the story forward toward a

206
00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:55.920
satisfying emotional climax the story
carefully takes us through their

207
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.839
personal Journeys the difficulties they
face with bullying and the joy of

208
00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:04.959
finding someone who truly understands
them all without becoming overly sad or

209
00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:09.480
dramatic the show has a light touch that
perfectly captures how Straits have been

210
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.360
telling us first love feels for
centuries the show gives us a real look

211
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.079
at Charlie as he deals with his
sexuality and the need to be accepted

212
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:21.519
he's not just a stereotype he's a fully
developed character going through the

213
00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:25.680
ups and downs of first love in a very
real way as for Nick the show does a

214
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.160
good job of showing his journey of
understanding that he's bisexual it

215
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.000
talks about the confusion and moments of
clarity that come with figuring out who

216
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.160
you are the series handles these complex
topics with a gentle touch that's both

217
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.279
admirable and sweet heartstopper also
shows the diverse experience of

218
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:44.880
different people in the queer Community
each character has a different story

219
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.440
reminding us that everyone's journey is
unique but there's still a common hope

220
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.759
and strength that they all share the
show is also notable or maybe notorious

221
00:15:55.759 --> 00:16:00.000
for not focusing too much on the sexual
aspect aspects of Nick and Charlie's

222
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.839
relationship this makes heartstopper a
strong argument against the idea that

223
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:08.720
gay stories are inherently too focused
on sex and therefore unsafe for kids or

224
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.680
young people to watch but while creating
a story focused on the sweet and cute

225
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.240
over the hot and bothered has attracted
an audience that might not usually watch

226
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.079
a show about queer characters it's also
seemed to alienate a large swath of the

227
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:26.880
queer Community there's been a rather
weird reaction to the second season of

228
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.240
the show in particular for instance
Queens Trixie and katata have a YouTube

229
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.199
series where they review Netflix shows
and movies called Queens who like to

230
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:36.720
watch when they reviewed the first
season among High fan demand and even

231
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.959
higher personal hesitation it seemed the
only point of contention was that Trixie

232
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:44.600
seemed to be irritated by the cute
depiction of gay people that can often

233
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.680
have us feeling exploited and patronized
while katata liked how cute it was fast

234
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.720
forward to season 2 and even katata was
over the cuteness and wanted to see

235
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.560
something a bit more grown up or at
least see the character's relationships

236
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.839
Advance Beyond hugging even if it was
offc screen the first season was cute

237
00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:04.959
but ask anyone who's been married for
more than 10 years those cute things

238
00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:09.480
about your significant others start to
get annoying real quick cute wasn't

239
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.079
cutting it anymore gay people were cute
when I was growing up in the same way

240
00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.959
that a Geral or a guinea pig would be
cute caged fonded over taken out to play

241
00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:23.640
with but ignored when no longer novel
and at the time probably dead within 2

242
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.559
years it felt patronizing to be reduced
to this we were either neutered and cute

243
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:33.480
such as in teen focused TV shows or
sexually active and eventually dead such

244
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.880
as in movies like Brokeback Mountain
tell me the puritanical moralization of

245
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.200
sexual values doesn't exist anymore many
creators lean toward this over the years

246
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.840
as a way to show gay representation
without pissing off the Straits too much

247
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.799
so I can understand why some people in
the gay community especially men my age

248
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:52.760
who grew up with the Trope of the sexist
gay best friend like Trixie would be

249
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.200
irritated by it even now when there is
pretty mainstream gay movies and shows

250
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.679
that do show the sex stuff like young
Royals and Elite but like I said ki's

251
00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:06.919
opinions seem to shift between the two
seasons our Queens who watch looked at

252
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.640
this story about a collection of various
queer 15 and 16year olds and they spent

253
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.799
the duration of their video railing it
because well nobody was getting railed

254
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:18.559
at a context I found this reaction a
little bit cringy and truthfully the

255
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:22.360
only time I really saw Trixie and caught
him miss a Mark heartstopper isn't a

256
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.600
show about sex so why should it be all
about sex they didn't want to see the

257
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.480
characters having sex they just wanted
to know that it was happening or

258
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.600
building up to happening because that
seemed more realistic to them and their

259
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.159
experiences to be clear gay people do
not want to see these characters having

260
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:43.360
sex but gay people do want to know that
gay sexuality is allowed to exist media

261
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.960
that divorces sexuality from identity is
to some annoying at best and triggering

262
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.159
at worst not to paint Trixie and katcha
in a bad light they're hardly alone in

263
00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:55.919
fact they're not even the first to have
this reaction there was a slew of gay

264
00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:59.320
men and queer people in general who held
nothing but contempt for heartstopper

265
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.520
from the word go and not even
necessarily for the aforementioned

266
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.480
reasons there were many who felt that
heartstopper was simply too edgeless and

267
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.840
seem to be presenting a purity mandate
projected at the entire queer Community

268
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.440
not unlike the messaging projected at
women in

269
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.760
general there is a trend among discourse
among women women about the allotted

270
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.080
role of a woman in the patriarchal power
structure men typically want women to be

271
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.440
sexually experienced but they also seem
to allocate a role for women that holds

272
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.600
them to a particular sexual Purity it's
a double standard for sure you have to

273
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.600
be a boss but you can't be mean you have
to lead but you can't squash other

274
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.280
people's ideas you're supposed to love
being a mother but don't talk about your

275
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.679
kids all the damn time the Madonna wh
complex exists for a reason you marry

276
00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:00.320
the nice girl not the one who give you a
 in a movie theater this bothered

277
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.440
elennis morset so severely that she made
one of the greatest songs of all time

278
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.000
because of it suffice to say women have
made it clear that they don't like

279
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.520
having the parameters of their sexual
qualifications gauged by a group outside

280
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.600
of women and I get it that's fing
annoying because on top of doing what

281
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.200
you want to do there is a looming social
decorum of what Society not only expects

282
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.159
you to do but will penalize you for not
doing all the while on the example of

283
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:31.080
sexuality there are other groups of
people who can do all the kinds of

284
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.440
sexuality things that they want without
any kind of repercussion heartstopper

285
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.559
seems to trigger these fears for some
gay men there is a perception that the

286
00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.760
show is presenting an argument that the
typical normal healthy gay teenage

287
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.720
relationship should only be as physical
as hugging and a couple of kisses for

288
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.600
which this is compounded through several
other high-profile instances of gay

289
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.960
media specifically one which made waves
in 2018 but that I will not explicitly

290
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.640
mention for reasons if you know you know
even though I

291
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.840
highly doubt that developing a normative
argument that gay men need to hold

292
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.280
themselves to a willful self-directed
abstinence program to be considered

293
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.120
valid by Society at large was Alice
osman's objective to be clear I do not

294
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.400
under any circumstances believe that
Alice Osman is trying to reaet queer

295
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.720
sexuality sex is omitted from their work
as per their license as a Creator but

296
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.159
they do not shame sex in their work
outside of Oman there is a fear of an

297
00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:32.480
external dictating what is and is not
acceptable sexual behavior among queer

298
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.039
people this fear wouldn't be valid were
it not for a small army of people who

299
00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:41.120
are currently trying to insist that any
queer visibility exists to indoctrinate

300
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.360
and corrupt the youth of today media
that so much as slightely leans towards

301
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.919
that sentiment even if only perceived
triggers this whole Cascade of hasty

302
00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:54.840
generalizations in our post Disney
acquisition of Star Wars World we've

303
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.480
started to conflate the creation Creator
and attitudes of a fandom we cross those

304
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.279
three wires a lot and we perceive that
the way a fandom is interacting with a

305
00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:10.120
particular example of media as being the
intended meaning of said Media or even

306
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.080
the values of the Creator themselves
take for instance the recent event of

307
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.360
Zack Snyder hiring a transgender writer
to write the prequel comic book for his

308
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.440
upcoming movie Rebel Moon a portion of
his fan base made up of red pill

309
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:29.039
basement dwellers were horrified to
learn that he in fact isn't a horrible

310
00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.720
person like them these are also the
people who think homelander is the good

311
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.039
guy so just because there are some
people holding up Nick and Charlie as

312
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:39.360
the archetype of how gay boys ought to
express their affection does not mean

313
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.279
that this is what the media is intending
my willingness to afford the benefit of

314
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:47.559
the doubt to a large swath of gays
including Trixie and Kata is that they

315
00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:51.240
don't want to directly observe the sex
lives of these characters but rather

316
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.240
comes from an annoyance for a condition
of gay acceptance being to follow not

317
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.840
only the Purity standards of straight
people but specifically the Purity

318
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.159
standards that are imposed on straight
women this may even betray a thought

319
00:23:05.159 --> 00:23:10.640
pattern in society even from our allies
that indicates that Society at large

320
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.720
still does not view gay men as actual
men external factions that dictate what

321
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.120
our sex lives ought to be are based on
the model of what straight people deem

322
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.960
to be acceptable when in reality queer
psychosexual development happens quite

323
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.520
differently especially in adolescence
during a formative age of communication

324
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.159
skills gender is a cultural barrier
between girls and boys this fluid line

325
00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:35.159
of same gender communication facilitates
a greater opening for interpersonal

326
00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:39.760
exploration at an earlier age this
changes the way queer people approach

327
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.520
sex this leads to a general Comfort
towards sexuality in queer circles and

328
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.640
also why it's troubling to see sex
negative sentiments arising from inside

329
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.880
the community even if a queer person is
a late bloomer so to speak they are

330
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.360
conditioned by a communal culture that
was shaped by early bloomers and thus

331
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.960
tend to slip into the way of thinking
regardless and it's also why the same

332
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.000
jokes about the sex lives of gay men do
not apply to gay women and vice versa

333
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.679
the result is a set of sexual
expectations that are almost completely

334
00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:13.080
inverted from heteronormative
expectations for instance second base

335
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.080
for straight people is apparently cop in
a feel over clothing second base for gay

336
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.760
men is according to patterns is anal
penetration weirdly gay bases are

337
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.919
reversed from the straight ones the Home
Run system is a gauge used to measure

338
00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:28.679
physical intimacy and commitment where
straight people tend interview sex as a

339
00:24:28.679 --> 00:24:33.720
reward for enduring a slow escalation of
physicality gay people start with oral

340
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.000
on base one and eventually come around
to home base which is holding hands in

341
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.679
public and it's highly coveted gay men
only want one thing and it's disgusting

342
00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:48.360
while second base for lesbians is
reportedly a U-Haul now there's nothing

343
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.919
wrong with depicting gay people not
having sex if we want our queerness

344
00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:58.559
defined based on internal merits rather
than owing public Val validation to

345
00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:04.320
having someone's hand to hold then this
is Paramount subsequently Arrow Ace

346
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.279
isn't the only expression of asexuality
you can be gay and Ace at the same time

347
00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:14.039
developing sexuality doesn't mean that
we need to see the characters doing it

348
00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:18.720
but people in the heat of budding
sexuality are bound to experiment a bit

349
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.440
it would be something that they would
talk about like confirmation through

350
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.720
dialogue it doesn't have to follow
Elite's footsteps but just like being

351
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.240
gay or trans not everyone who
self-identifies as asexual now always

352
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.159
knew that about

353
00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:46.799
themselves sex is like broccoli to know
you don't like broccoli you first kind

354
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:50.279
of have to eat broccoli there's even a
chemical in broccoli that you can only

355
00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:54.320
taste if you have a very specific active
Gene those who have it find broccoli to

356
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.679
be rancid they physiologically cannot
enjoy this vegetable for everyone else

357
00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:03.919
it's great it's
good it's fine given society's push to

358
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:09.799
present sex as pleasurable many start by
trying it out and then spend maybe even

359
00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:13.640
years trying to figure out why it's not
working for them keep in mind that a

360
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.880
sexual doesn't always mean no sex drive
Ace like everything else in sexuality is

361
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.760
not only a spectrum but a matrix this is
pertinent as heartstopper author Alice

362
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.600
Osan self-identifies as asexual themsel
which likely means that as per the

363
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.679
Stanley rule of write the stuff you wish
you could read they want romantic drama

364
00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:33.760
that isn't just focused around sex and
that should be that it should be

365
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.360
abundantly okay for this kind of media
to exist just as it should be abundantly

366
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.039
okay for young Royals and Elite to exist
there is a compelling case for queer

367
00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:44.840
media to portray the more innocent
aspects of life stories of friendship

368
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.000
Adventure Coming of Age familial bonds
and the quotidian Joys and struggles

369
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.200
that make up the human experience these
stories matter because they reinforce

370
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.520
the idea that we queers are not defined
solely by our sexuality by diversifying

371
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.360
the types of stories told within LGBT
media we affirm that queer people lead

372
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.320
Rich complex lives that are worth
depicting in all their facets not just

373
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.120
in relationship to their sexual identity
portraying a range of stories from the

374
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.480
queer perspective also dismantles the
misconception that our narratives are

375
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.440
inherently adult or explicit it
challenges the strawman fallacy that the

376
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.679
presence of queer characters in themes
just makes something inappropriate for

377
00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:26.720
young audiences hopefully creating a
space for even more conservative parents

378
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.480
to let their kids watch this media and
feel a little bit less alone in the

379
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.640
world heartstopper fills this role
perfectly but we also have to accept

380
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.559
that not every queer story should be so
innocent when it comes to drag queens

381
00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:43.960
and gay performers especially those who
tour they encounter an astronomical

382
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.440
number of gay and queer people
especially among other performers they

383
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.840
get to know each other quite well
including stories of their teenage years

384
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.679
and this includes my own discussions
with queer people seriously it's one of

385
00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:57.120
those like wait everyone else was having
sex it seems that in high school for a

386
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.279
lot of gay they took the opportunity to
dive deep into experimentation

387
00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:05.399
heartstopper is a direct contradiction
of what many had either experienced

388
00:28:05.399 --> 00:28:09.360
directly or by proxy and so it feels
like it's trying to develop a

389
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.000
puritanical objective for young gay men
alternately and this is touching on the

390
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.559
handholding part of heartstopper is that
for gays of a certain generation and by

391
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:20.120
that I mean neither too old nor too
young being confronted by heartstopper

392
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.760
under the assumption that it is meant to
mimic reality is triggering believe me a

393
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.799
lot of gays would have loved to
instantly find a high school boyfriend

394
00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.640
with whom they felt comfortable enough
to explore emotional intimacy and hold

395
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.919
hands the gay home run as it were
however this generation who are in their

396
00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:39.640
late 20s and early 40s now my generation
may have very well wanted this

397
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.080
experience but we came of age when being
out and gay as a teenager wasn't trendy

398
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.279
if you don't mind my flippancy for
myself and others we were the only out

399
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:50.200
gay in school and so seeing something
like heartstopper may feel like a

400
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.159
culture is telling us that we were doing
it wrong alternately for those who

401
00:28:55.159 --> 00:28:58.880
didn't even know that they were gay as a
teenager let alone come out heartstopper

402
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.080
is a reminder of what could have been
again again again this is a community

403
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.360
yes even the CIS gay men who have
undergone complex trauma that we as a

404
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.720
society still do not recognize as trauma
for all that even the staunchest Allies

405
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.919
do to make coming out easier today we
still have to come out in a society

406
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:19.320
which is grandfathered in a myriad of
cultural attitudes that are incompatible

407
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.279
with queerness which create natural
obstacles for us we exist in an

408
00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:27.480
operating system that is not designed
for us the trauma comes with Society

409
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:33.440
placing the burden of integration on us
Society does not truly acknowledge this

410
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.200
as trauma because social understanding
of queer trauma is related to bigotry

411
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.760
and not the complex constructed from
watching your straight CIS friends be

412
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.399
able to live out a number of Life
Experiences as they see fit whereas the

413
00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.480
queer individual having been raised
under the assumption that they are

414
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.799
straight Andor Cy must make concessions
and compromises based on how soon or

415
00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:58.240
late they shift into their queerness
combined with media that dict Ates queer

416
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.039
experiences there are going to be across
theboard feelings of I lived my life the

417
00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:08.240
wrong way you are dealing with this
group of people when you develop queer

418
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.000
media we're a tough crowd and rest
assured it's not all our fault with the

419
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.440
amount of complex trauma residing in
this group it makes perfect sense that a

420
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.440
piece of media meant to uplift and
Inspire the

421
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.039
lgbtqia will have the inverse unintended
effect of telling many of these people

422
00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:31.200
that they messed up and that missing out
on all those experiences is their fault

423
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.440
and no you can't go back and fix it like
I came out when I was 12 and I haven't

424
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.519
had an actual boyfriend my whole life
many gay people cope with this by

425
00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:42.679
telling themselves that their teenage
fantasies were simply impossible media

426
00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:46.559
instances that refute this without
explanation may very well feel like

427
00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:51.519
direct personal
criticism for having trauma trauma

428
00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:56.679
trauma trauma generational trauma trauma
trauma this is what trauma looks like

429
00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:59.919
these are the feelings that heartstopper
digs up in some people so it makes

430
00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:05.480
perfect sense why the criticism would be
so focused on presenting sexuality in a

431
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.639
show that is neither focused on it nor
is it required it makes sense perhaps

432
00:31:10.639 --> 00:31:15.120
but it is irrational even though trauma
itself is valid there is an onus on the

433
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.760
individual to respect their own trauma
without pushing it out into the world

434
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.919
but that's just heartstopper what of the
opposite an inability to consume media

435
00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:28.919
that is sexual because it presents those
same Sensations of queer fomo perhaps

436
00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:31.639
this is why some gay people are
uncomfortable with seeing gay sex in

437
00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:34.960
their streaming movies not because
they're squeamish about dicks and butts

438
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.880
but because it's hearkening to a painful
reminder of what they feel like this

439
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.919
movie is telling them they missed out on
and I'm sorry for how polarizing this

440
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:47.679
video is I know it must seem like I'm
jumping around a lot if I'm not settling

441
00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:52.279
on a clear critical Target it's because
I'm not trying to Target anyone when in

442
00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:56.639
fact I'm trying to defend media's
ability to exist as a Creator's Vision

443
00:31:56.639 --> 00:32:00.720
but also defend why queer people have
such a dodgy relationship with media

444
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.080
featuring queer people nobody's really
in the wrong

445
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.919
here except of course Millennia of
puritanical imperialism and postcolonial

446
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:13.200
patriarchal values that have resulted in
us feeling like we're overdue for a

447
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.120
little dignity and

448
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.559
autonomy in regards to queer resistance
around media I see two issues the first

449
00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:32.399
being that queer people including gay
men have been so under represented for

450
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:36.720
so long and Tabo predominantly
represented by depictions that moralize

451
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.880
US based on hedonistic etiquette we feel
an obligation to watch queer media where

452
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.679
we are featured in the hopes that it
will break the representation glass

453
00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:49.159
ceiling this is particularly more true
for wide relase high-profile examples of

454
00:32:49.159 --> 00:32:54.799
queer media this is why Bros Got rave
reviews from mainstream critics while

455
00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:59.360
Fire Island was mostly ignored it's also
a very erratic circumstance of media

456
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.559
criticism where red white and royal blue
was targeted for its sexiness but Bros

457
00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:07.200
upon release was hailed as the Advent of
queer acceptance among mainstream

458
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.240
critics even though it had a lot more
sex among a lot more people and was not

459
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.240
nearly as good we're shooting ourselves
in the foot by following Trends highly

460
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:21.120
promoted queerness is queerness that has
been bespoke to have as much appeal to

461
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.880
straight audiences as possible think
broke Back Mountain would that have been

462
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.600
as successful had it not started two
heart throbs that women wet their

463
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.840
panties over and who simultaneously came
across as Butch enough for straight guys

464
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.360
to feel comfortable with the problem in
practice is that this obligation

465
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.480
implores us to watch media we simply may
not be interested in either outside of

466
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.080
our preferred genres or featuring
casting that we don't like or something

467
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.240
which may contain triggering elements
that we don't even know our trigger

468
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.240
simply because we don't consider
existing in a society that does not

469
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.559
accommodate our identities as cptsd
trauma the second issue is as per an

470
00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:02.399
unawareness of said complex trauma we
are unable to compartmentalize a

471
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:06.799
negative reaction to Media as a trauma
response in which case we try to

472
00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:10.720
intellectualize by interpreting this
media as making a normative argument

473
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:18.159
about all of gay people so like to quote
an incredibly problematic white man dude

474
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.679
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar Heart
Stopper is just trying to be

475
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.720
heartstopper not every artist or author
is out there trying to make a fictional

476
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.440
Manifesto out to ref C and shape the
world I don't think this is limited

477
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.839
exclusively to queer people but we seem
to take every instance of queer

478
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:38.839
representation as a Manifesto we treat
these media as if each one is actively

479
00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:43.200
trying to set a universal precedent for
the state of modern queerness sometimes

480
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.399
this is true like with Barbie which was
a movie about Womanhood the interaction

481
00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:52.919
between wom and the idea of woman and
where men may fit into this idea at

482
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:56.320
which point you are allowed to disagree
with the premises and conclusions of the

483
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.240
movie you're also allowed to disagree
with some finer points and some nitpicky

484
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.280
elements of the conclusion but overall
enjoy the movie or appreciate that it

485
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.440
exists slightly disagree does not need
to mean burn it in a fire this is

486
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.880
probably the clearest problem that
exists within left of spaces today that

487
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:20.160
is a fallacy of composition it's not
intellectual and it's certainly not sexy

488
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.359
you know who does that the alt-right
Disney made this movie about a strong

489
00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:29.440
female character so the entire company
now has a woke agenda apparently and so

490
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.839
on and so forth the difference being
that those on the right at the very

491
00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:38.760
least generally agree on who to hate
we're letting them divide us we have a

492
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.680
reluctance to let queer media be
fantasies instead as we're starved for

493
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.079
visibility we look at each one as the
media that might make or break our

494
00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:51.319
personal autonomy heartstopper is a
fantasy red white and royal blue is a

495
00:35:51.319 --> 00:35:56.040
fantasy young Royals is a fantasy
because for all that heartstopper may be

496
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.440
seen as an early indicator of a total
failure of queer writes it's certainly

497
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.640
an outlier next to a larger body of work
that includes the affir menion media and

498
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.040
many others heartstopper might be
popular but red white and royal blue is

499
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.240
the most watched Amazon Prime movie in
the history of the service the issue is

500
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.400
not with heartstopper but a fear of
living in a population that leans toward

501
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.720
that as the only acceptable
manifestation of queer expressions of

502
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.240
affection which is not an issue with the
media but rather the way we seem to

503
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.119
expect these instances of representation
to apply to the whole of queerness and

504
00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:36.720
that rather than finding red white and
royal blue wanting for not being able to

505
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.960
present the multitudinous range of
queerness we can observe these pieces of

506
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.839
media as being pieces of a growing whole
which seems to be leaning to Greater

507
00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:51.400
inclusivity as it grows this feels like
a popularity contest where the largest

508
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.440
fandom gets to decide what is and is not
an acceptable expression of queer

509
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.599
specifically gay love and the people who
have the smaller Voice next to a large

510
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:04.839
fandom of teenage girls are gay people
the fear is rooted in a sensation of not

511
00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:09.800
having control over our own depictions
that are projected to queer people

512
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.480
because it's these fictional examples
that are held up as archetypes for real

513
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.520
people to be compared

514
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.839
to one must acknowledge the historic
invisibility of gay narratives within

515
00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:31.560
the mainstream media landscape the
journey from non-existence to the

516
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.440
peripheries and at long last to have
media with as diverse portrayals as

517
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.960
heartstopper young Royals red white and
royal blue not to mention more adult

518
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.319
focused media has been a copian task for
the gay community this traversal has

519
00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:48.280
been marred by periods of grotesque
caricature and an almost vois Safari ISM

520
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.960
that othered and fetishized gay
relationships casting them in a light

521
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.240
that shimmered with Scandal rather than
substance and these types of portrayals

522
00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.960
are far from Gone especially in other
parts of the world but that's a

523
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.560
different video sign up for the patreon
to get us there yet as the pendulum

524
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.280
swung towards inclusivity a new critique
arose from the old prejudices the claim

525
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.200
that gay media is too sexualized
concealing the age-old detraction of the

526
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.440
gays themselves are too sexual in some
sense this reflects a societal

527
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.599
discomfort with the candid portrayal of
homosexual Love and Desire it is as if

528
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:30.359
the very Act of two men or two women
expressing their sexuality must be

529
00:38:30.359 --> 00:38:34.359
shrouded in a chased Veil lest the
onlooker be confronted with the

530
00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:39.280
unvarnished truth of affection and maybe
even have to rethink their own inner

531
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:45.960
feelings moreover this assessment often
stems from a myopic view of gay media

532
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.280
taking as its evidence a narrow
selection of works that are

533
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.400
intentionally provocative or which
challenge societal Norms around sex and

534
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.839
sexuality to paint the entire of gay
media with such a broad brush is to

535
00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:05.240
ignore the rich tapestry of stories that
span the spectrum of experience from the

536
00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:11.000
platonic and the familial to the
romantic and yes even the sexual to deny

537
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.079
the sexual component of gay
relationships in media is to deny a

538
00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:20.160
fundamental aspect of human connection
regardless of orientation sexuality

539
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.160
after all is a potent element of The
Human Condition and its representation

540
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:29.119
in art and storytelling has long been a
conduit for deeper understanding a

541
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:34.240
mirror reflecting the complexities of
love lust and longing heteronormative

542
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.599
narratives have long enjoyed the
privileged of unabashed sexual

543
00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:45.280
expression without inviting the same
level of scrutiny in contrast gay media

544
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.200
often faces a double-edged sword a
clamoring for representation on one hand

545
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.560
and a prudish recoil at the
manifestation of that representation on

546
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.640
the other there exists an unspoken rule
it seems that gay characters must not

547
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.920
only be present but must also comport
themselves in a manner palatable to the

548
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:10.560
heterosexual majority their sexuality
expressed with a modesty that is seldom

549
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.560
demanded of The Straits is it not then a
form of cultural suppression to dictate

550
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.160
the terms of representation to confine
the narratives of a community to the

551
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.520
narrow confines of what is deemed
acceptable by those who wield the

552
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.200
loudest voices gay media in its Essence
is a rebellion against such constraints

553
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.800
a declaration that love in its Myriad
forms will no longer be relegated to the

554
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.480
Shadows perhaps there are naturally
going to be various push back

555
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.280
consequences when dealing with a large
group of people who have been jerked

556
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.520
around let on and outright lied to for
decades knowing our history can

557
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.839
establish a context for why we Face the
struggles we do but also offer us

558
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:56.040
insight into what methods work to create
change and what methods don't spoiler

559
00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.520
alert for gay rights being loud
obnoxious and altogether ungrateful and

560
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:05.319
shoving our sexuality in people's faces
has tended to be a more successful route

561
00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:10.079
than working within the system and
making friends for marriage equality we

562
00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:14.359
stopped asking politicians to help us
and started demanding equality by hiring

563
00:41:14.359 --> 00:41:18.480
High Price Lawyers and taking people
States and whole countries to court for

564
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.400
being gay in the military we tried it
the nice way and we got don't ask don't

565
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.680
tell so then we started marching and had
our gay millionaires threatened to stop

566
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.240
donating to democratic politicians if
they didn't repeal the thing and when it

567
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.839
came to AIDS we did absolutely
everything that every privileged person

568
00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:39.440
says you're not supposed to do if you
want people to like you because asking

569
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:46.520
politely got us ignored even those of us
who knew Ronald Reagan but I digress the

570
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.480
Hallmark of an oppressor is to divorce a
community from its own history it makes

571
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.680
it easier for controlling powers to
dictate what that history was or simply

572
00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.480
lie about a political body's involvement
in systemic institutional and social

573
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.839
discrimination the diversity of
relationships and experiences within the

574
00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:10.200
lgbtq community should be shown not all
gay men have the same experiences nor do

575
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.760
all lesbians bisexual people trans
people or queer people in general and

576
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.880
let's not forget the representation of
asexuals and A- Romantics who are often

577
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.680
completely overlooked in media the
inclusion of diverse relationships and

578
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:29.200
sexual Dynamics is important whether it
be runchy sex in a bath house or holding

579
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.640
your high school boyfriend's hand
visibility in all forms of media

580
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.839
including media directed at younger
people like heartstopper is incredibly

581
00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:41.200
important there's a growing resistance
to including queer characters in movies

582
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.319
shows and books directed at a ya or
younger

583
00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:49.720
audience based on the misconception that
their presence inherently involves adult

584
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:55.000
themes however children's media is an
ideal space to introduce the concept of

585
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.280
diverse families and friend friendships
teaching acceptance and understanding at

586
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.720
a young age
finally we must recognize the queer

587
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.400
representation is not the end goal but
part of a broader movement towards

588
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.400
inclusion and equality it's a means for
storytelling that reflects the world as

589
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.800
it is in all its diversity and at its
best it can influence perceptions and

590
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.920
Foster
empathy it's not just about seeing

591
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.160
oneself on the screen it's about
everyone seeing the multifaceted world

592
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.160
World We Share learning from it and
finding the universal human experiences

593
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.839
that connect us all your experiences are
not erased because Charlie and Nick can

594
00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:43.040
hold hands your trauma is not invalid
because Society doesn't recognize it you

595
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.440
don't have to live up to the fairy tale
that Alex and Henry's story is told in

596
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.000
no matter what you feel there is no
wrong way to be queer there are no rules

597
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.119
saying if you didn't meet your boyfriend
in high school then you did things wrong

story maybe you're just starting

599
