1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Hey everyone. Before we start the video I 
just wanted to thank everyone who’s donated  

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.240
to the Telos Pictures IndieGoGo campaign. 
We’ve passed 600% of the original goal  

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.880
and its all thanks to you. If you want to 
support the creation of an LGBTQ production  

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.520
company that will make movies for LGBTQ people, 
you can join at the link in the description.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.840
Now let’s get to the latest 
slap in the face from Disney.

6
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.560
"We understand how important this issue is to 
our LGBTQ+ employees and many others. For nearly  

7
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.960
a century, Disney has been a unifying 
force that brings people together.  

8
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.120
We are determined that it remains a place where 
everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

9
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.720
The biggest impact we can have in 
creating a more inclusive world  

10
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.960
is through the inspiring content we produce, the 
welcoming culture we create here and the diverse  

11
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.320
community organizations we support, including 
those representing the LGBTQ+ community.”

12
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.640
That was the Walt Disney company's 
response when asked what their position  

13
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
is on Florida’s Don’t Say Gay bill. 
If you haven’t been watching the news.

14
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.240
The Don’t Say Gay Bill is a piece of crap 
education bill in Florida, the intention  

15
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.960
of which is to outlaw all discussions surrounding 
sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.

16
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.720
Florida House Bill 1557 was introduced in the 
state House of Representatives in January,  

17
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.080
while an identical version, 
called the Senate Bill 1834,  

18
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.920
(I assume these bills are named after the year 
each political body thinks we still live in)  

19
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.040
advanced in the state Senate. Both bills, 
titled ‘Parental Rights in Education’,  

20
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.360
ban classroom discussions about sexuality and 
gender identity in quote “primary grade levels”,  

21
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.040
but does not specify exactly what a “primary grade 
level” is, let alone which age bracket it defines.

22
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.880
Which is common with other discriminatory bills, 
that being that they do not necessarily place  

23
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.200
limits on the scope of what the bill is meant to 
do. Contrast to a bill about parking regulation,  

24
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.400
which will be three-hundred pages long, include 
every foreseeable caveat and exception to the  

25
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.960
bill, and include a thrown-in clause about lawn 
maintenance in a single cul de sac within one of  

26
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.440
the signer’s municipal districts. Especially in 
America, bills are usually incredibly specific,  

27
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.360
because the public and law enforcement (in theory) 
need to know the limits of their legal authority.

28
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.760
Descriminatory bills usually do not have 
limits because the governing authorities  

29
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.120
want to provide as much leeway for 
further discrimination as possible.  

30
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.360
It’s less about generating a mandate for civil 
action and more about removing restrictions on  

31
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.920
existing bigoted people, and validating 
their biogtry with political authority.

32
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.920
The bills seek to ensure greater rights for 
parents to decide what their children are  

33
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.320
exposed to in school. An earlier bill passed 
by Republicans, known as the ‘Parents’ Bill of  

34
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.960
Rights’, was meant to give parents the right to 
“direct the upbringing, education, health care,  

35
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.120
and mental health” of their children. 
 
Republican lawmaker Joe Harding, yeah  

36
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.840
this asshat, who introduced the bill in the state 
House of Representatives, hopes it will quote:  

37
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.400
“reinforce the fundamental right of parents 
to make decisions regarding upbringing and  

38
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.320
control of their children.”
 
“Control… of their children…”

39
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
"Creating boundaries at an early age 
of what is appropriate in our schools,  

40
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.880
when we are funding our 
schools, is not hate," he said.

41
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.440
Essentially saying that any child whose family 
can’t afford a progressive private school doesn't  

42
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.080
deserve to learn about anything other than “and 
when mommy and daddy fell in love, a stork came.”

43
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.760
This is curious as the language of 
this bill is directed at giving parents  

44
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.840
‘more control’ over their families. 
However, the mandate of the bill  

45
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.280
is to dictate what is and is not appropriate 
in public. Which, contrary to the language,  

46
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.240
targets parents who do support their queer 
children, and brands them as being unfit,  

47
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.400
or as fostering ‘inappropreate’ 
social attitudes among their children.

48
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.200
Therefore, the public may interpret this as the 
supportive parents of queer-children themselves,  

49
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.920
being social delinquants. And that they deserve 
whatever consequences may come their way.

50
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.760
This bill promises freedom for parents… as long 
as they conform to a specific kind of freedom.

51
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.600
Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida 
and a favorite for the 2024 Republican  

52
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.160
nomination for president, said that it was 
“entirely inappropriate” for teachers to  

53
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.240
be having conversations with students 
about gender identity. He also said:

54
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.920
“Schools need to be teaching kids to read, 
to write. They need to teach them science,  

55
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.560
history. We need more civics and 
understanding of the US Constitution,  

56
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.520
what makes our country unique, 
all those basic stuff.”

57
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.040
Yes he said “all those basic stuff”

58
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.120
Is our children learning? (George W Bush)

59
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.520
And we know Florida school books aren't exactly 
prime real estate for truthful depictions of,  

60
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.480
say, the war of Northern Aggression, now don’t we?

61
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.840
Anyway.

62
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.080
On February 25th this passed through 
the Florida House of Representatives,  

63
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.320
on its way to quickly becoming law.

64
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.160
President Joe Biden, or someone on his 
team (more likely), quickly tweeted:

65
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.080
“I want every member of the LGBTQI+ community 
— especially the kids who will be impacted by  

66
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.160
this hateful bill — to know that you are loved 
and accepted just as you are. I have your back,  

67
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.720
and my Administration will continue to fight 
for the protections and safety you deserve.”

68
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.520
In response to the bill passing, former 
Disney CEO and Chairman Bob Igre wrote  

69
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.120
“I’m with the President on this!... this bill will 
put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy.”

70
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.560
Side note: it’s been theorized that Igre 
intends on running for president as a  

71
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.480
democrat in the near future so he doesn’t want 
to get on the bad side of any gays right now.

72
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.400
And this is true to form for democrats who 
use social outrage to signal that they’re  

73
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.040
on the right side of history. Whereas if 
Iger actually wanted to make a difference,  

74
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.680
there is a lot he could do that would be more 
substantial than tweeting the equivalent of  

75
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.920
‘that goes for me, but double.’ Like… 
spend some of his hundreds of millions  

76
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.360
of dollars on supporting young 
LGBTQ people he’s so worried about.

77
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.760
But here’s the rub. Bob Chapek, the 
current CEO and Chairman of Disney said  

78
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.560
nothing. The only thing that came out 
with his name even associated with it  

79
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.080
was that milk toast non-statement I 
read at the beginning of the video.

80
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.040
You see, Chapek’s been busy putting his 
own stamp on Disney corporate culture,  

81
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.760
and is clearly less willing than even Igre to 
advocate for, you know, human rights causes.  

82
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.200
For example, The Hollywood Reporter… reported that 
a knowledgeable source at Disney has said that  

83
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.080
Chapek balked at the idea of weighing in on even 
fighting over voting rights in Florida. Quote:

84
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.360
“Chapek is staunchly opposed to 
bringing Disney into issues he  

85
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.680
deems irrelevant to the company and its 
businesses,” this anonymous person said.

86
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.600
Which is a massive problem because Disney brings a 
lot, and I mean A LOT of money into Florida, so if  

87
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.160
Disney were to threaten to pack up it’s east-coast 
theme park and leave the sunshine state if certain  

88
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.640
bills were passed, that could significantly 
impact political decisions in that state.

89
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.960
They did that when Georgia was messing around with 
these kinds of bills, since most Disney movies are  

90
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.840
now shot in Atlanta, and the state backtracked 
on its own hateful political agenda real fast.

91
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.280
According to a source familiar with both 
Iger’s and Chapek’s leadership thought process,  

92
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.720
Iger tended to speak out NOT only when issues 
affected the company’s business interests but  

93
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:29.200
when they affected its employees, now numbering 
nearly 200,000. But this person says Chapek  

94
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.040
has taken a narrower view and has been concerned 
that Disney might be viewed as too liberal.

95
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560
HAH!

96
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.200
(That might be funny if it wasn’t so 
terrifying. Welcome to the tagline of 2022!)

97
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.320
Even when his own employees push back against 
his reluctance to say that gay kids are valid,  

98
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.760
he prefers to make these conversations 
as hush hush and in-house as possible.

99
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.600
Disney’s chief diversity officer 
sent a message to staff on March  

100
00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.040
2 referencing “deeply troubling and 
heartbreaking” developments in the news,  

101
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.680
noting that Chapek had asked “to meet with leaders 
in our company’s LGBTQ+ community to discuss how  

102
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.600
Disney can best support these important 
and valued employees and cast members.”

103
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.680
She went on to say that the company 
would schedule “Reimagine Tomorrow,”  

104
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.600
conversation on March 22nd that will be dedicated 
to “issues of concern to our LGBTQ+ colleagues,”  

105
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.320
and announced a company-wide “Reimagine 
Tomorrow Global Summit” for April 13th.  

106
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.000
The assumption is that Chapek will take part 
in these events, but that has yet to be seen.

107
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.680
Disney has 77,000 employees in Florida 
alone, where it operates both parks and  

108
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.040
cruise lines. Pre-COVID, Disney Parks accounted 
for more than one-third of all company revenue.  

109
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.440
In 2021, when still contending with the pandemic, 
the division brought in $16.5 billion in revenue.  

110
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.240
In 2019, its last full year pre-COVID, 
it brought in $26.2 billion.

111
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.080
“Disney is a leader in LGBTQ 
workplace equality and content-”

112
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.800
Content?

113
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.960
A leader in LGBTQ content?

114
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.840
Well that’s… news…

115
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.400
Have we been looking at the same release 
schedule, Disney? Like ‘leader’ as in racing  

116
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.640
ahead of the competition, venturing into uncharted 
territory, and developing new innovations which  

117
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.520
inspire others to keep up with you? Because 
none of those things are going on these days.

118
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.080
The only real cinematic innovations that have come 
out of Disney lately are the projection screens  

119
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:35.040
that they use the Mandalorian, and letting 
Chloe Zhao shoot a superhero movie outside.

120
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.000
Innovation!

121
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.280
Meanwhile, on the gay front, Netflix’s 
ever-expanding library of LGBTQ-content  

122
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.840
dwarves whatever Disney’s peddling 
as their next first gay character.  

123
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.800
You’re not even a follower, Disney, you’re 
just kinda Lebnitzing your way to fame.

124
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.960
Newton publishes his theory of optics,  

125
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.320
you write a very public letter to make 
sure everyone knows you were doing it too.

126
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.680
Nick wrote that one. Now the 
Lebnitz stans are gonna come for me…

127
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.520
Though really, is it worth mentioning 
Netflix is good fair for queerfolk when  

128
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.080
they just re-signed Dave Chapelle for more 
comedy specials after he was “canceled,”  

129
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.720
big quotes there, for saying some 
horrible stuff about trans folks.

130
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.560
They just don’t cancel people like they used to.

131
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.720
But pay no attention to that, queer-consumers.  

132
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.640
You get a whole second season 
of Young Royals! Coming soon…

133
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.200
(Yeah we’ll talk about that 
later. There are thoughts.)

134
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.920
Like if your words and your actions 
aren’t going to say the same thing,  

135
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.240
at least Netflix is putting a budget into 
trying to convince us that they give a damn.  

136
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.840
I mean find yourself a corporate conglomerate 
that’s gonna gaslight you softly, am I right?
 
  

137
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.200
But Guess who’s gonna have a 
rainbow logo during pride month?

138
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.600
The answer is everyone. Everyone will have 
a rainbow logo during pride month. Because  

139
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.880
only among the queer community can you go to such 
minimal effort to get the most positive feedback.

140
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.960
In all this discussion about raising awareness for  

141
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.200
gay rights, it’s like everyone stopped 
listening after the ‘awareness’ part.

142
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.800
A whole lot of good awareness does when it comes 
to laws that explicitly target us — and now  

143
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.560
our parents. The ones who actually care about us! 
Because the lawmakers are sure AWARE we exist now!

144
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.680
And Florida is not alone in this renewed crusade 
against queer kids. Dozens of laws have popped  

145
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.800
up across the country trying to keep any gender 
or sexuality confirming language out of schools.

146
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.400
Including a widespread book ban that, 
although took a chainsaw approach,  

147
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.880
famously banning books like Maus from classrooms,  

148
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.440
also took out any LGBTQ focused or 
inclusive books they could find as well.

149
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.080
Texas is where the real ire 
has been pointed recently.

150
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.720
Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion that 
likened gender-affirming care for minors to child  

151
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.080
abuse. Days later, Governor Greg Abbott doubled 
down with a letter calling on professionals,  

152
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.160
including teachers and doctors, to report parents 
who give their children gender-affirming care.  

153
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.480
The letter added that there would be similar 
reporting requirements for the general public,  

154
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.880
and consequences for those who don't report.

155
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:05.280
Which, given that medical professionals are 
— professionally — heald to confidentiality,  

156
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.840
even in instances where someone has 
been murdered, these lawmakers seem  

157
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.400
to be asking doctors to choose between 
their medical licence and fines or prison.

158
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.360
Where else have you been 
legally required to report  

159
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.600
people who are doing things that the 
dear leader has a personal problem with?

160
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.040
You know what? Don’t even answer that. I’m sure 
I had some specific, totalitarian, authoritarian  

161
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.600
bureaucrat in mind. But really ‘reporting your 
neighbors to authorities’ isn’t exactly rare  

162
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.520
and is something we really should have left 
in the 20th century with Joseph McCarthy.

163
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.520
Now, Adri Pérez, a policy and 
advocacy strategist at the ACLU,  

164
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.880
pointed out that neither the letter 
nor the opinion are legally binding.  

165
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.120
No one actually has a legal duty to report 
someone receiving gender-affirming care.

166
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.160
"They have no legal effect, and they cannot 
curtail anyone's constitutional rights," Pérez  

167
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.680
told NPR. "The attorney general and the governor 
can share their opinions, but it is just their  

168
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.240
partisan opinion that have been created to 
target transgender kids and their families."

169
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.480
But the message is crystal clear. Regardless 
of what call to action may or may not be in  

170
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.000
a piece of legislation, the state is projecting 
the message to its citizens that descrimination  

171
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.880
is acceptable in this instance. And that 
the state will not prosecute persecution.  

172
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.280
That, if you believe that 
Americanness is qualified as  

173
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.600
adhering to American laws, bigotry 
is the ‘American’ thing to do.

174
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.400
Emmett Schelling, the executive director of the 
Transgender Education Network of Texas said:  

175
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.200
"The state leadership has said, 'We would 
rather see dead children ... instead of happy,  

176
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.360
loved, supported, thriving trans 
kids that are alive and well."

177
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.960
Texas proposed more than forty bills 
in 2021 alone that targeted trans and  

178
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.000
non-binary youth in the state. As if a bunch 
of queer minors are the most dangerous threat  

179
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.320
to American national security right now. Or 
ever. But especially right now especially.

180
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.480
In October 2021, the Texas legislature passed 
a bill barring transgender girls from playing  

181
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.040
on girls sports teams, and transgender 
boys from playing on boys sports teams.  

182
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:18.000
The law went into effect in January, making Texas 
the 10th state to enact similar legislation.

183
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.520
So you can see these acts 
of hatred aren’t going away.

184
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.920
But it’s not like there’s 
been no push back to this.

185
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.280
Students across Florida staged school walkouts 
in response to the Don’t Say Gay bill.  

186
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.960
While politicians say LGBTQ issues are "not  

187
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.200
age-appropriate" for the age group, 
the student vehemently disagreed.  

188
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.720
Waving rainbow picket signs and shouting 
“We say gay!” in walkouts across the state.

189
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.440
"The language and the supporters of the bill 
and the rhetoric around the bill really shows  

190
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.760
what this bill is, and it's an attempt 
to hurt queer people like me," said High  

191
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.880
School senior Jack Petocz, who organized 
the statewide protests on social media.

192
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.360
In response to the rally Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’ 
deputy press secretary, said in an email:

193
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.880
"All Floridians are free to exercise 
their First Amendment rights  

194
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.320
and peacefully express their 
opinions about any issue.”

195
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:16.880
After the rally, Jack Petocz was called into his 
principal's office and suspended "indefinitely."

196
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.240
On Feb. 22, writer Benjamin Siemon, whose résumé 
includes several Disney credits like Ducktales,  

197
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.960
took to Twitter to call out the studio for not 
taking a stance on the Florida legislation.

198
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.840
“I love and have loved working for Disney, but 
I am deeply saddened by their silence when it  

199
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.800
comes to speaking out against the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ 
bill, especially now that an amendment suggests  

200
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.320
teachers must disclose a student’s sexuality 
even if they know that child will be harmed.”

201
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.400
The Republican hard turn into 
banning the existence of queer kids  

202
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.440
has actually presented challenges to giant 
corporations in several states. Recently,  

203
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.200
Texas Competes, an LGBTQ advocacy organization 
representing more than 1,400 corporations in  

204
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.000
the state — including Marriott and Dell — 
condemned Governor Greg Abbott after his  

205
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.920
anti-trans statements. (though it is of note that 
Disney is not a part of the Texas Competes group.)

206
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.400
Scott Maxwell of The Orlando Sentinel 
wrote recently that Disney donated money  

207
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.640
to Florida State Senator Dennis Baxley, who has 
actively backed anti-gay legislation for years,  

208
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.400
including laws that would block 
gay couples from adopting children,  

209
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800
and that they’ve also backed other politicians  

210
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.920
who support “Don’t Say Gay” legislation, 
as have Comcast, NBCUniversal, and AT&T.

211
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.680
Baxley also once compared kids who 
live with same-sex parents to kids  

212
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.480
raised by alcoholics and abusers and later said,

213
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.040
“I’m not phobic, but I simply 
can’t affirm homosexuality.”

214
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.040
Because although these Republican state 
senators might be putting children,  

215
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.720
Disney’s main demographic, in danger, they 
also tend to keep corporate tax rates low.  

216
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.320
And which one weighs on the conscience 
of Disney investors more? The potential  

217
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.360
trauma and death of queer children? Or 
the idea of their stock price dropping?

218
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.680
I realize a lot of people have rose-tinted 
nostalgia goggles when it comes to disney,  

219
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.360
and I myself enjoy a lot of the content, but as 
a corporation, their primary priority is their  

220
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.440
stockholders. Not their audience, not 
their employees, not their legacy. And  

221
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.560
the stockholders don’t seem to have a problem with 
this corporation (that produces children's media)  

222
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.760
supporting politicians who support legislation 
that targets and discriminates against children.

223
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.560
I can say that all we have to do is target 
Disney’s profits in response to this to drive  

224
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.640
down revenue which would negatively impact 
dividends… the shareholders would then hold  

225
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.000
an emergency meeting and the board of directors 
would put pressure on Chapek to do… something?

226
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.160
But wouldn’t it just be nice if people with 
money actually cared about anything else?

227
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.960
Florida Democratic State Representative Anna  

228
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.800
Eskamani said that companies like 
Walt Disney’s priorities are clear:

229
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.240
“The business lobby seems more 
focused on securing tax breaks…than  

230
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.160
living up to their so-called 
corporate values of inclusivity.”

231
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.560
And all the while Disney stays quiet. 
Well… all except Abigail Disney. Writing:

232
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.440
“It’s pretty fundamental. As Einstein said, 
you can’t stand still on a moving train.  

233
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.640
When laws are being passed that are this 
hateful and dripping with prejudice,  

234
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.480
there is no neutrality. Not saying anything 
is saying a lot. ⁦@WaltDisneyCo get a spine”

235
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.040
Abigail Disney also called her family legacy 
into question after it was revealed that the  

236
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.160
Walt Disney Company donated to the representatives 
who supported the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Stating:

237
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.080
“I could not be more unhappy 
with their political activities,  

238
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.360
both in terms of whom they fund and how 
they lobby. I would strongly support a  

239
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.240
law to require all corporations to reveal 
ALL of their funding and lobbying moves.”

240
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.800
It’s worth noting that Walt Disney World 
is located near Orlando, Florida, and the  

241
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:59.920
Disney parks recently issued a fifth “key” called 
“Inclusion” to its Cast Member Training Worldwide.

242
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.440
Empty platitudes from a soulless corporation.  

243
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.280
But they said they won’t be releasing any 
movies in Russia for the foreseeable future.  

244
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.360
So at least we know that war can bring them 
to their senses. Though they were pretty okay  

245
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.880
with Russia arresting and disappearing 
queer folk for the last twenty years.

246
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.560
The nihilist in me just kinda 
wants to shrug and say ‘well…  

247
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.080
can you really expect anything 
better from a soulless corporation?’

248
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:34.080
In fact the nihilist in me becomes more and more 
significant the more this happens. Because every  

249
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.360
step we take to that whole… be the change you 
want to see in the world — ends up being a door  

250
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.760
in the face. It’s easier to keep your head down 
and move along. Scrape by however you can manage.

251
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.320
But for some people, being able to 
‘scrape by’ is a best-case scenario.

252
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.320
Let’s say you have a relatively open-minded 
population. Or at least, a population for  

253
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.680
whom the majority are ambivalent, 
but who exist in a cultural zeitgeist  

254
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.000
where the ethical code is geared 
towards morality and community-building.

255
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.720
Let’s also say that there is a fraction 
of the national political body who,  

256
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.000
for the sake of perpetuating their actual agenda,  

257
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.120
target specific groups to destabilize, 
distract, and disenfranchise.

258
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.200
If this moral population is able 
to make ends meet comfortably,  

259
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.440
they will naturally demonstrate their 
dissatisfaction with the discriminatory practices.

260
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.240
However, take this same population, and 
over-work it to the point of chronic burnout.  

261
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.840
This population now exists in a situation where 
it is nearly impossible for large groups to make  

262
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.000
a living without working multiple jobs, 
or working too much at one job. They are  

263
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.320
crushed under a successful workplace propaganda 
effort that workers rights are detrimental to a  

264
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:54.560
worker’s income, and where the only valid work 
ethic is to work as much as humanly possible.

265
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.120
Between work, family, and kids, are they going to  

266
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.560
have the time or energy to actively 
participate in political discourse?  

267
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.880
Looking south from over the border, I’m honestly 
surprised — and impressed — that as many people in  

268
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.240
Florida and Texas have showed up to stand 
against these bigoted laws as they have.

269
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.400
Right-wing lawmakers have an invested 
interest in limiting the number of  

270
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.040
people who benefit from widespread social 
rights. The less groups of people who are  

271
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.360
politically ‘valid’ — the easier it is to develop 
consistent propaganda to manipulate these people.  

272
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.840
And also generating a horde of 
exploitable labor from the underclass.

273
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.920
That last part is key. Because, a fun fact that 
lives in my head rent-free is that, at its peak,  

274
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.400
roughly 70% of the Roman Empire’s population… 
were not Roman citizens. They were slaves.  

275
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.240
Slaves, and freed slaves, 
throughout the empire’s domination,  

276
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.000
made up the bulk of what we now 
consider to be ‘the roman people.’

277
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.160
That other 30% — and an even smaller 
fraction was actually the socially  

278
00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:02.400
superior ‘Patrician’ class — required a legion 
of slavery in order for society to function.

279
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.000
So if we’re still sitting around 
wondering why we can’t all just get along,  

280
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.960
it’s because a collection of social superiors 
NEED an underclass in order for their lives to  

281
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.800
function. Costs of labor cut into profits. And 
if slavery is ‘illegal’ — except for instances  

282
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:24.480
of mass-incerceration — the next best thing is to 
make it as cheap as possible to exploit someone.

283
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.440
And someone is easier to exploit if the 
government is consistently de-valuing  

284
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.600
their identity and their selves. 
What right do you have to ask for  

285
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.680
a living wage if the government itself has 
deemed you as not being suitable to exist?

286
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.520
Meanwhile, non-queer-people can’t 
seem to understand WHY suicide is  

287
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.560
still highest per-capita among queer 
youth, specifically queer trans youth.

288
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.240
You know what they need? MORE AWARENESS. 
That’s all they need. More awareness.

289
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.720
Why are there all these suicides? Haven’t all of  

290
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.080
these depressed queer kids seen 
the rainbow logos every June?

291
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.240
Haven’t they seen all the gays 
Disney’s been putting in movies?  

292
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.000
Like that one in Cruella, or Beauty 
and the Beast, or Jungle Cruise.  

293
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.320
I mean they never said they were 
gay in the movie but still. OH,  

294
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.840
and that guy from the Eternals. I didn’t go 
see it but I’m sure these LBGTABC kids did.

295
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.560
Don’t they know they’re being seen? I’m 
doing MY part! I watch Queer-Eye on Netflix!

296
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.440
The objective of these laws is not to erase 
queer people. These lawmakers aren’t dumb—

297
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.960
Well… most of them…

298
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.840
The corperate moguls funneling money 
into these lawmakers aren’t dumb.  

299
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.400
They know queer people have this weird 
habbit of repopulating themselves because,  

300
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.040
i don’t know, deviations from cis-hetero 
identity expressions are somehow doccumented  

301
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.120
throughout all of biology. These 
laws are not to erase queer people,  

302
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.880
it’s to make our lives as difficult as 
humanly possible so that the upper-echelons  

303
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.800
of our society have a chronically refreshed 
underclass of people that they can exploit.

304
00:24:53.600 --> 00:25:00.240
And nobody’s more in need of an exploitable 
labor pool like a corporation with a theme park.

305
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.280
Even though lawmakers and CEOs and billionaires 
may not really have a problem with queer people,  

306
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.360
in order to have an easily available 
desperate underclass who will  

307
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.520
be (presumably) grateful to 
work whatever job they’re given,  

308
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.640
they require the public at large to put as 
much social pressure on this group as possible.

309
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.680
And when it comes to corporations 
and their apparent support of rights,  

310
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:30.080
their silence is in their best interest. Because 
it is them who benefit from the underclasses.  

311
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.000
The more people are persecuted, and 
the more severe that persecution,  

312
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.800
the less they have to actually do to turn 
around and trumpet how progressive they are.

313
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.000
They give us less, they pay us 
less, and we’re grateful because  

314
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.800
‘LGBTQIA-Friendly cooperation to the rescue!’ All 
the while indirectly supporting our persecution  

315
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.560
because ‘tax breaks’ — or worse, being entirely  

316
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.320
indifferent to our suffering and trying to 
turn around and make a buck off us anyway.

317
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.880
We’re not a community to them, we’re a 
sponge that they can squeeze anything out of.

318
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.000
Cheap labor, grateful for the opportunity to work 
in a place where our coworkers won’t spit on us?

319
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.240
They got that.

320
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.920
An audience so starved for 
any meaningful representation  

321
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.000
that the slightest nod in our 
direction sends us into euphoric fits?

322
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.240
They got that.

323
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.520
Without competition to see who can make 
the best queer content, we’re sitting  

324
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.800
at the wrong end of half a dozen monopolies 
of hetero-hegimonistic CEOs and billionares  

325
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.720
who think they have the right to decide what 
we want. Because they’ve been systematically  

326
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.920
eliminating — not only our options 
— but our very rights and dignities.

327
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.840
They’ve got this lie going where they 
want us to think that we need them.  

328
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.800
That we have no other option but to support 
them because who else are we going to support.

329
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.120
Big companies like Disney are like Buffalo Bill 
from the Silence of the Lambs. Unable to actually  

330
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.760
change or transition, but more than willing to 
wear the skin of any minority that suits them.

331
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.960
So in spite of the fact that these ‘Don’t 
Say Gay’ bills may end up being toothless or,  

332
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.200
struck down by higher courts, and that there 
may be no way to actually enforce them,  

333
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.680
they are projecting to the public at large 
that their anti-trans and anti-gay laws are not  

334
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.640
bigotry — they are the right way to be an 
American. That people who feel that ‘cis’  

335
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.840
is a slur against non-trans people have the 
backing of, at least, the state government.

336
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:30.240
These are laws to embolden people who were already 
bigoted, or to coerce people who were indifferent.

337
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.080
Or maybe who knows? There’s gonna be an anti-queer 
gestapo with state funding turning up soon.

338
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.800
This is America. Who knows anymore?

339
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.680
I’m tired. I’m really tired.

340
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.640
I’m tired of begging these 
shit-heads for representation.  

341
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.600
And tired of fighting with these other 
assholes to please look at us as people.

342
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.920
It would be very easy for Disney to come out 
and say “We oppose what the state legislature  

343
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.560
is proposing in Florida and we may not renew 
our certain land leases within the state”.  

344
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.240
It’s an empty threat, because Disney would never 
abandon Walt Disney World in Orlando, but that’s  

345
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.840
77,000 people who would lose their jobs at Disney 
if the state goes through with these draconian  

346
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.400
hateful laws. That’s 77,000 people who would be 
activated to stop these laws from being passed.

347
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.960
Just say the words Disney. I’m not asking 
for gay superheroes this time. We got one,  

348
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.800
and he was awesome. I’m not asking for a 
gay prince charming. I’m not asking for  

349
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.120
a trans disney princess. I’m asking 
you to say “No.” when these vicious  

350
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.373
politicians say “You can’t say gay, 
but you sure as hell can say hate.”

351
00:28:38.373 --> 00:28:45.680
You can say “no”. You can say “We say 
gay” like these kids did. They have  

352
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.520
more balls than your billion dollar 
corporation and your heartless CEO.  

353
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.160
Tell the state you’ll pull 
your business out of there.

354
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.080
Do something. For Christ sake, with everything 
going on in the world right now you have the  

355
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:04.480
power to make SOME peoples lives a little bit 
easier. Or, Jesus, at least not harder than they  

356
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.400
already are. Queer kids, even with the most loving 
families, still live in fear in the best of times.

357
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.200
So show them that you’ve got their backs. That you 
actually do care about families. That the money  

358
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.560
from those goddamn rainbow mickey ears we all buy 
actually goes to doing something to help instead  

359
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:26.000
of just feeding donations to hateful politicians 
who will give you your goddamn tax breaks.

360
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.320
Do something.

361
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:39.840
Do something.
