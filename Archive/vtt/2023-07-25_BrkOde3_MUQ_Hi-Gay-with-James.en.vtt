minutes ago I only had time to shave and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
I was just watching another video of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.939
well I'm really early hopefully next
time I won't be really late

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
wow my skin looks really smooth like

19
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.040
like it's like fake smooth or something

20
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.740
I saw that champion Ashley I I've never
seen

21
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.899
um
I've never seen High School Musical

22
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.700
before
so it's I I've only kind of

23
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.280
taken in the
uh

24
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.720
sort of cultural

25
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.280
information about about him

26
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.599
I did see Barbie I actually uh released
Nick and I recorded a podcast as soon as

27
00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.340
we got home uh for patrons

28
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.560
going after matpat on Twitter for old
tweets

29
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.260
you got always got to be careful about
your old tweets

30
00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.739
luckily my old Twitter accounts are dead
from like 2012.

31
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.540
when I was even more opinionated than I
am now

32
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.860
oh thank you Dominion Domino mask

33
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.980
I actually couldn't wear these for the
longest time because they were super

34
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.140
tight on my nose and then I discovered
that they have the little adjustable

35
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.680
pads

36
00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.080
I've never watched Pushing Daisies which
I love everyone who was involved with

37
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.700
Pushing Daisies so it's kind of weird
that I haven't watched it

38
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.659
[Music]
um

39
00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.599
I should kind of I should put it on my
like to watch list

40
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.239
oh I did Tibby it's it's a that's it's
he's such an idiot

41
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.780
you know not to idiot shame but he's an
idiot

42
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.360
and I will continue to dead name Twitter
because it's not called X

43
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.980
literally grown every time Lee Pace is
on screen because

44
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.040
yeah I think a lot of people kind of
discovered him via The Hobbit

45
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.220
and we're like oh what is this
otherworldly Beauty

46
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.080
besides hell of a boss you have
recommendations for shows or movies to

47
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.740
watch on YouTube
um not really

48
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.100
um I don't watch a whole I haven't been
watching a whole lot of YouTube lately

49
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.300
which is kind of
I've been complaining so much about the

50
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.160
views on my videos being down and here I
am not watching YouTube

51
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.540
um
but uh

52
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.040
I I mostly I haven't been watching a lot
of stuff because I'm like okay if I if I

53
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.280
watch something
am I going to feel like I'm copying it

54
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.639
if I do a video about the same kind of
thing and

55
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.419
so I haven't been watching that much
YouTube uh that's actually a lot I've

56
00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.139
been watching a lot of wrestling YouTube
but as far as like shows that are on

57
00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.100
YouTube I can't really think of any
other than

58
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.440
like I think the only like narrative
stuff I'm watching on YouTube is

59
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.660
like Brandon Rogers stuff
um which is an acquired taste and I

60
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.039
can't actually recommend everyone as
much as I would like to recommend it to

61
00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.220
everyone

62
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.340
the conservative backlash to Bar it's it
is hilarious it's it was actually very

63
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.060
sad and pathetic but it's also very
hilarious

64
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.800
um just the fact that I don't know if
they've actually seen the movie but like

65
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.180
the whole point of it is that the
patriarchy is bad for everyone men and

66
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.080
women cans and Barbies and Allen's and
they seem very very upset at the idea

67
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.280
that the patriarchy is bad and it's like
uh

68
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.220
I feel like as a culture we've kind of
come to the conclusion that the

69
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.860
patriarchy is bad what are you doing

70
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.080
I didn't know there was a new trailer
for Interview with the Vampire

71
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.740
give me a moment
why did that not end up

72
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.419
anywhere in my

73
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.840
Duff how did I not see that one sec
where is my headphones

74
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.699
I don't know where my headphones are

75
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.560
I have found my headphones okay

76
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.000
I'm gonna watch The Interview with the
Vampire trailer live

77
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.400
because I'm a I'm a reactor YouTuber now
apparently

78
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.020
okay I need to change this to be nope
play sound through this B God Windows is

79
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.139
so complicated
through the speakers

80
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.180
okay give me one sec

81
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.580
know what I'm actually

82
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.860
let's do this the right way

83
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.400
let's do this the right way

84
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.720
okay they're at the oh Armand's at the
table

85
00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.800
where did we leave off

86
00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:25.819
I know they've recast Claudia
but

87
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.699
the actors they got pretty spot on

88
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.720
the status everywhere they can't escape
him

89
00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:28.800
uh so I really like I forgot that the I
forgot about the time Jump stuff that it

90
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.380
was going to be taking place like during
World War II I forgot about that

91
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.519
can't wait for petty ex-boyfriend let's
start next season yeah I feel like

92
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:45.420
season three is going to be adapting the
Vampire Lestat so that's gonna be and

93
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.680
that's going to be interesting to see
what they do that and do with that

94
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.300
just got out of my second viewing of
Barbie no it just started

95
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.740
um
I've only I've only seen Barbie once

96
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.240
I feel like I'm a bad gay

97
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.240
my response to that would be it's a
Barbie movie directed by Greta Gerwig of

98
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.519
course it's going to be about gender in
some way

99
00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.540
James I have a question you're doing a
watch along for the first episode of

100
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.080
good omen season two with only patrons
correct because I'm binging it all

101
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.680
through the night I want to hear
thoughts ASAP

102
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.680
um I haven't decided if I'm doing a
watch along uh a good omen's watch along

103
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.660
with patrons yet actually I know I'm
doing a Heart Stopper one

104
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.019
next weekend

105
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.660
um
because

106
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.140
I know the way I work and the watch
along will end up being watching the

107
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.160
entire season in one go uh which is easy
with Heart Stopper because it's only

108
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.079
half hour episodes but with good Omens
being hour-long episodes

109
00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:58.800
um
it's kind of a different story

110
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.920
um but
coming out in like three days

111
00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:08.360
so that's going to be

112
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.120
I'm gonna have to figure I'm gonna have
to figure that out

113
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.440
you're gonna have to figure that out

114
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:29.100
what does why is steam randomly opening
I did not tell you to download

115
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.779
what are you doing go away thank you
that's that's enough of you

116
00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:41.579
'll said season two was five hours long
so that's either five episodes or six

117
00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:46.980
episodes at around 45 minutes each
I'm guessing probably six episodes

118
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.779
because that makes
sense I think because I think the first

119
00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:54.620
season was six episodes

120
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.959
me and my friend didn't think it was
even

121
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.100
getting a second season it's exciting
yeah it was actually it's been filming

122
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.600
forever I feel like it was in production
for a long time

123
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.779
um

124
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.660
and we were actually gonna have a video
coming out uh kind of talking about how

125
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.100
Neil Gaiman is a straight guy who's
surprisingly good at queer characters

126
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.899
um but some stuff uh somehow Nick's been
dealing with some health stuff and so

127
00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.440
we're not rushing into that I want to
give them some time to recover and

128
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.860
everything so
excuse me

129
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.820
so that's going to be delayed until
August but that's a a patron exclusive

130
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.779
until
October I think

131
00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:40.260
I can't remember
I can't remember when it's coming to

132
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.279
YouTube I have it written down on a
calendar downstairs but that's far away

133
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.040
apparently Theo apparently

134
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.540
that's all wrong

135
00:13:08.339 --> 00:13:14.180
uh Kura I'm I'm guessing it's either

136
00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:17.339
I'm guessing they're like 45 minute
episodes

137
00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:23.700
is my assumption and then that would
equal six 45 minute episodes

138
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.060
um
I don't I don't think the first season

139
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.720
each episode was an hour exactly but I
might be wrong I might be wrong

140
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.360
because most Network hour-long TV shows
are 45 minutes and I think because Prime

141
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.360
does have I think Prime has a
commercial

142
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.260
version
I think

143
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.899
there are six okay there are six
episodes so yeah that makes sense

144
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.880
it's funny to me that for most
conservatives this will be their first

145
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.959
introduction to the work of Greta garway
I actually I don't think I've seen any I

146
00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:21.000
have no I haven't I don't think I've
seen any of Greta gerwig's movies before

147
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.660
I didn't see Little Women and I can't
remember if I saw Lady Bird or not

148
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.459
oh Jason I don't even know if Mayfair
witches is getting a second season that

149
00:14:32.459 --> 00:14:35.480
that was a mess

150
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:01.220
spoilers for good Omens
I wonder what that what they are

151
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.180
spoilers don't usually ruin stuff for me
um

152
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.740
like I'm fine knowing how things end are
they bad spoilers as in like they they

153
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.399
spoil a really big plot or are they bad
spoilers as in like they make the show

154
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.639
bad

155
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.320
Alexander Daddario needs to change
agents urgently

156
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.420
why do you say that I'm trying to
remember who Alexandra Daddario is

157
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:34.740
spoiler a really big plot okay all right
if it was like bad spoilers as in it

158
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.060
like makes the show bad then that would
be

159
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.839
that would be sad

160
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.740
oh she right she was in Mayfair witches
right yeah

161
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:58.399
um everyone who worked on that show God
it was such so bad

162
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.820
uh where did I buy the cap that was at
uh Game Stop yeah GameStop used to be

163
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.300
called EB Games here in Canada but it's
GameStop now

164
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.060
one sec
over there

165
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.699
I have returned

166
00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:58.259
they did green light Mayfair witches
season two

167
00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:03.240
wow and I know the first season was
really did not have really great views

168
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.679
uh the ratings weren't great for it and
the ratings were like really good for

169
00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:12.000
Interview with the Vampire so that kind
of says to me that

170
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.020
uh hopefully we absolutely will get an
adaptation of the Vampire Lestat

171
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:28.280
what is going on YouTube why are you
showing me this loading thing

172
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.679
uh Corwin I did for nimona Nick and I
did a podcast talking about it we're

173
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:48.360
doing that on the patreon now uh we
watch something and then immediately

174
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.320
record a podcast afterwards it's called
going in raw

175
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.740
um
and uh we recorded about an hour-long

176
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.880
podcast talking about nimona
so I don't think we'll be doing a video

177
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.840
about it
um unless they announce a sequel or

178
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.080
something like that
but uh

179
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.220
yeah we did we did kind of we did talk
about it it might end up being a part of

180
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:18.200
a video uh coming up in the fall but I
can't say for sure

181
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.000
I did see the Heart Stopper trailer uh
more kissing than I expected lots of

182
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.299
kissing
um

183
00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:31.080
I'm just really glad that the oh you're
being gay

184
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.240
carry on that that line made it into the
show because I laughed my ass off when I

185
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.860
read that in the books
okay

186
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.620
I'm I'm frustrated that bottoms isn't
about a bunch of bottoms because I feel

187
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.600
like it's missing it's it's it the title
is missing something

188
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.919
I feel like it should be about a bunch
of like whiny twinks or something

189
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:06.360
I did not see Oppenheimer I I wanted to
go see it

190
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.480
um

191
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.160
but it's just like
it's three hours long

192
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.240
and depressing
and so I am going to watch it when it

193
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.620
comes out on streaming so I can just
kind of watch it at home but uh I don't

194
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.820
think I'm gonna see it in theaters

195
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:45.059
one of the guys from red white and blue
is also inbox oh

196
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.500
Prince Henry's in Bottoms

197
00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:52.380
he looks really different when he's not
blonde like I've seen some press stuff

198
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.919
that they did before the strike and he
looks so different when he's not blonde

199
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.539
but are you here for Barbie oh yes I I
saw barbie at uh Thursday night

200
00:20:09.539 --> 00:20:12.299
screening
um

201
00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:17.340
at a VIP Thursday night screening thing
which VIP just meant really expensive

202
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.600
tickets wasn't like actually
like there weren't like celebrities

203
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.039
there or anything like that big seats
basically

204
00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:30.059
um and I loved it I loved every minute
of it I want to see it again I just have

205
00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:34.760
to uh
decide when

206
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.500
no I didn't dress in pink I actually
ended up wearing all black

207
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.720
by accident and uh the theater I was at
didn't have a Barbie box

208
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.080
it might have in the normal section of
the theater because it's kind of the

209
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.100
theater's like sectioned off there's the
VIP screens which like I said it's

210
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.940
basically the VIP is they'll feed you
they'll serve you food they give you a

211
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.360
menu and stuff
um and it's like recliner seats and then

212
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.260
there's the normal theater where the
IMAX is and stuff like that

213
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.960
um they might have had the box out in
the normal theater but they didn't have

214
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.799
it over where I was

215
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.039
they had so many different like popcorn
stuff and and like beach ball drink

216
00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:31.740
things and none of it was in the section
that I was in you'd think that since the

217
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.980
tickets were more expensive that they
would have you know made a point to

218
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.179
point that out to us

219
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.100
Oppenheimer has gay characters

220
00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:58.020
that being said I did go and buy two
Barbies well a Barbie and a Ken for the

221
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.280
first time in my my whole life

222
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.120
not hating but for a movie all about
social gender

223
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.200
social gender hell I didn't think Barbie
had enough queer sub text or text it's a

224
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.179
little on the where the conversation was
10 years ago side the thing is if it had

225
00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:29.580
actually had like talking more about
like trans people and non-binary people

226
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.640
and stuff like that
it either never would have gotten made

227
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.000
or
it never would have made any money

228
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.500
that's that's the issue

229
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.100
which is really frustrating like I think
red white and royal blue if red white

230
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.940
and royal blue had come out in theaters
I think that would actually have been

231
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:59.480
really successful but Amazon doesn't
really put things in theaters very often

232
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.440
I would buy a Mojo Dojo casa

233
00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:18.419
oh thank you Jared meese
not a whole lot of people watch that I'm

234
00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:21.200
glad you enjoyed it

235
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:28.500
off topic but have you seen the movie
Fire Island I just did do it

236
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.120
I just did
uh yeah I have seen it uh and it's uh

237
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.200
it's really good I was really happy that
it got nominated for uh I think it got

238
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.799
nominated for two Emmys
um

239
00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:44.240
and I was really happy about that

240
00:23:57.419 --> 00:24:02.039
wait there's there were two oh right
right yeah oh I didn't even notice that

241
00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:07.140
great I know the two Ken's kissed Ken on
the cheek but I didn't notice that it

242
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:12.080
was the gay ones
well the gay actors

243
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.240
but I mean all the Kens were pretty gay
I mean the beach off at the very

244
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.360
beginning of the movie pretty much set
that up that yeah we're dealing with gay

245
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.960
Kens here

246
00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:45.659
I haven't seen the movie but the part in
the trailer I saw I had to try so hard

247
00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:48.440
not to laugh

248
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.039
the thing that I really liked was the
funniest parts of the movie they

249
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:56.240
actually didn't put in the trailer

250
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.200
that I was actually shocked by some of
the parts that just had me like

251
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.580
gutterally laughing

252
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.820
like fascist Barbie just I was
absolutely dying

253
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.400
I want my depression Barbie

254
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.220
I mean if you look at it like

255
00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:44.700
as far as like employing queer people
there was a trans Barbie there were two

256
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.799
gay Barbie well two gay Kens there was a
lesbian Barbie it has surprisingly large

257
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:54.779
queer cast considering it didn't really
technically have any queer characters

258
00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:59.039
no there's not a fascist Barbie if you
if uh if you see it you'll know what I

259
00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.220
mean

260
00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:09.919
I just absolutely like doubled over
laughing my ass off

261
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.679
foreign

262
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.480
oh my God

263
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:34.279
oh I need to see it again I feel like I
I I need to see it again

264
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.039
um I haven't seen Oppenheimer I'm gonna
see it when it comes out on streaming or

265
00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:41.220
on Blu-ray
um

266
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.460
but I
can't

267
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:50.659
I don't want to go sit in a theater for
three hours and be depressed

268
00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:03.260
is it bad I drive like Barbie

269
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.179
I wish they'd Focus much more on
Barbie's existential crisis instead of

270
00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:20.460
Ken being freaking cringe all the time
excuse me

271
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:25.260
for me every second with Margo is gold
but then they focus on anything else I

272
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.740
was like can we go back to Barbie
yeah I mean my favorite parts of it were

273
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.120
Barbie I thought Ken was really funny
um I didn't think there needed to be as

274
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.159
much Ken as there was
but I I think they kind of they wanted

275
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:42.539
to do that so that they would kind of
cover their bases a bit to be like this

276
00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:46.679
is a movie for men and women and it is
kind of showing how the patriarchy is

277
00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:50.840
bad for men too
um

278
00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:54.779
and I mean all the critics are saying
Ryan Gosling's getting an Oscar

279
00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:58.559
nomination and they're the one that he's
the one that they're really focusing on

280
00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:02.159
which I think is a bit of his disservice
I think I think Kate McKinnon should get

281
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:05.000
a nomination as well

282
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.820
on the fence about the movie I want to
see it but what do you think I think

283
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.460
it's absolutely worth seeing it's really
really funny

284
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.659
I don't think they're gonna announce if
they're smart they won't announce it can

285
00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:24.480
spin off until after the Oscar
nominations because there's a lot of

286
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.900
talk of Oscar nominations for this and
if they announce a sequel It's just

287
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.380
gonna take them out at the knees and the
Oscars won't do and it won't touch them

288
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.059
except for the technical Awards

289
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.340
now that Barbie is at what other movie
how are you excited about this year I'm

290
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.419
excited for red white and royal blue
and

291
00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:55.740
other than that not really anything
because a lot of movies are being

292
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.940
delayed into next year because of the uh
actor strike

293
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.320
um
and so I'm not really excited for

294
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.740
anything until
stuff is coming out there were some

295
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.419
movies that I was excited for that have
been delayed so I'm just gonna hold my

296
00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:17.340
powder on most of that the new Exorcist
movie looks It looks interesting though

297
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.460
and that's coming out in October and I'm
pretty sure they will release that

298
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.980
because it's Blum House they really
don't need some horror movies don't need

299
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.539
an ad campaign really
uh Shadow project they're talking about

300
00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:32.880
pushing Dune back until maybe June of
next year depending upon uh

301
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.679
if and when the strike is resolved

302
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.179
I wish I had a man who would mansplain
the Godfather during the whole movie

303
00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:49.760
those burpees don't oh good thank God
thank God

304
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.539
I hated Ken song I want to die but I do
recommend the movie Barbie's final lines

305
00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:06.480
the final line was amazing
um

306
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.740
and I actually like Ken song I've sang
it a bunch of times I have it in my

307
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.460
Babel music now

308
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.279
how's the strike impacting Telos and
production uh well because Telos doesn't

309
00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:30.659
have the money to well actually we
discovered we do have the money to work

310
00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:34.380
with actra which is Canada's version of
sag

311
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.399
um actra is not on strike
um

312
00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:42.000
but some of the actors that we would
that we've been that I've been talking

313
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.980
to
um are actually members of actra and sag

314
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.039
and so
um

315
00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:55.080
I'm hoping that sag gets
fixed sooner rather than later so that

316
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.279
they can work but because it's
technically because it is an independent

317
00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:04.380
production they actually could work sag
will give them permission to do that

318
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.880
um
so uh yeah that's a really long way of

319
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.419
saying is really not uh going to affect
Telos because we are not in the ampta

320
00:31:14.419 --> 00:31:20.179
and so we are not a part of the
group

321
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.960
a24 is apparently able to film because
they agreed to sags terms yeah they

322
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:38.159
actually left I they left the ampt is it
the amptpa or the the American Producers

323
00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:42.840
association thing
um they left that because so that they

324
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:48.240
could agree to sags terms and so a24 can
make whatever movies they want and

325
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.140
actors can work with them which I'm like
that's what more Studios should do

326
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.799
because apparently there's only a couple
of Studios that are actually holding it

327
00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:58.980
up Disney and Warner Brothers and most
of the other ones just kind of want to

328
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.860
get back to work
um

329
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:07.860
and so I'm like leave the producers
Association just leave and get back to

330
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.779
work and let Warner Brothers and Disney
drown

331
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.919
I I think it's going to be great for the
independent film industry because

332
00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:27.360
there's already a lot of actors kind of
calling for big name actors to take

333
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.399
smaller roles for Less pay to kind of
boost up the smaller producers that are

334
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:38.039
willing to work with you know
guaranteeing that there's no Ai and

335
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:41.399
guaranteeing the residuals and stuff
like that

336
00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:44.700
um they're kind of like you know if the
big guys won't do it we can afford to

337
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.059
take the pay cut let's go work for these
smaller companies and build them up so I

338
00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:51.779
think I think the producers are kind of
shooting themselves in the foot because

339
00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:56.760
what they don't realize especially with
the actors is 99 of the actors in Sag

340
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.020
have a second job because acting doesn't
pay the bills so they're not going to

341
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:06.299
lose their houses because they're
already working and they can just

342
00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:10.440
take more hours at their second job
um

343
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.940
and so the actors strike can go on a lot
longer than I think the writers strike

344
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.120
can
and so it's going to be the Studios have

345
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.240
kind of stepped in a pile of and
now they they don't want to lose face

346
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.840
and seem weak but they're gonna they're
gonna have to

347
00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.039
or a bunch of them can just come out and
say it was Warner Brothers in Disney and

348
00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:34.399
 them

349
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.960
sorry if you already answered I logged
on just now saw your hat and got excited

350
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.360
oh any favorite Pokemon starters
totodile's my favorite Pokemon starter

351
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.019
that's why I want another remake of the
gold and silver era because I love

352
00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:57.620
Totodile

353
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.100
my little
my little excitable crocodile

354
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.700
why is there an emoji thingy on the side
of the chat

355
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.839
uh what do you mean

356
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.760
they did make kind of horse girl

357
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:44.540
crocodile has always confused me
why is it a cave Croc yeah it's weird

358
00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:59.520
uh not too bad sore Sora Z sore Z Sora
Zed

359
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.580
um

360
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:08.520
been a been a strikes weird oddly
stressful time considering taking the

361
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.260
summer off not really
um

362
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:18.420
but uh
been weirdly stressful period

363
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.700
but hopefully things will be getting
better

364
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.880
good
what are some movies you think are over

365
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.220
I think a lot of movies are overrated
I could just go down the list of best

366
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:34.099
picture not a Best Picture winners and
tell you some overrated movies

367
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.200
hey Jason

368
00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:53.040
do they have car boot sales in Canada
I don't know what that means

369
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.270
maybe we do and we call it something
else

370
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.500
[Laughter]

371
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.480
Christopher Nolan has a weird fan base
he's actually oddly a lot like um

372
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.380
like uh Zack Snyder where I actually do
think Zack Snyder is really talented

373
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.980
director I think he needs to work with
better writers but I do think he's a

374
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.560
really talented director and I think
Christopher Dolan's a really talented

375
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.940
director but Christopher Nolan is given
and Zack Snyder have been given other

376
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.300
than with Justice League they've been
given way too much creative control over

377
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.839
their projects which has been
um

378
00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:34.280
to the detriment of them

379
00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:42.119
do you think Barbie will reach a billion
I think it definitely has the potential

380
00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:46.140
to get to a billion which would be
amazing because it's a movie that

381
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.160
deserves it and it's a movie that didn't
cost 300 million dollars so it would be

382
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.760
really nice to have a
it cost 140 million which is now

383
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.140
considered a medium budget movie
um

384
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.440
but I I would love to see it get
nominated

385
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.760
all right I would love to see you get a
billion dollars my brain is just all

386
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.099
over the place
um

387
00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:12.660
I'd love to see it get to a billion but
it's I think it's all going to depend on

388
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.260
the second weekend
like are people gonna see it more than

389
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.280
once is the big question

390
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.400
how are laws surrounding filmmaking and
films in general in Canada different

391
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.160
than the ones in the U.S
uh law wise there's there aren't really

392
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.359
laws kind of prohibiting production or
anything like that other than you know

393
00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:40.380
you have to get permits if you're
shooting outside and stuff like that

394
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.339
um
but uh

395
00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:49.680
excuse me but it's very difficult to get
funding in Canada

396
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.839
um I was actually talking to someone
who has been working in the film

397
00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:00.000
industry in Canada for a long time and
he's worked on movies and TV shows and

398
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.599
TV shows that have like been on network
that have been funded by the networks

399
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:07.560
and stuff like that and I was telling
him how much

400
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.079
um Telos has Telos was uh given and how
much we got because we got about 50 000

401
00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:17.640
from the uh amount donated
um

402
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.300
and uh
I was like we're gonna take we're going

403
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:27.119
to try and take that take about half of
that or 30 000 of it to make a movie and

404
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:31.560
then uh hopefully make some money off of
that movie and then do another one etc

405
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.420
etc uh and he who has worked in the
Canadian film industry for a long time

406
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:42.540
was like wow I've worked on Productions
financed by the government that had

407
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.920
smaller budgets
which kind of made me the bed to me

408
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.220
I got to be honest
um

409
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:55.320
and uh
kind of explains why everybody with

410
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.560
budgets like that it kind of explains
why all the filmmakers and actors leave

411
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.619
Canada
um

412
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:07.700
but uh yeah budget wise is really the
the constraint

413
00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:12.500
for making movies in Canada not so much
the laws

414
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:21.180
seen Barbie three times no one can stop
me doing it again

415
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.260
I can't even get it like I was going to
go this evening because I was I wasn't

416
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.700
feeling the best and I wanted Barbie was
gonna make me feel good

417
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:35.280
um and I checked online and everything
sold out

418
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.240
and so I was like well I guess I'm
not going to see Barbie tonight

419
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.180
I really wish Quebec had genre films and
animated films our Cinema really lacks

420
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.619
ambition right now at least Quebec can
make movies and not have to rely on the

421
00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:59.540
federal government's insane
funding parameters

422
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.380
who would you say is worse Canada or
England for funding movies

423
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:22.920
um Canada because to fund a movie in
Canada you have to make it so obscenely

424
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.760
Canadian no one outside of Canada wants
to watch it no one inside of Canada

425
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:32.579
wants to watch it movies made in England
are allowed to you know appeal to people

426
00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:35.480
who don't live in England

427
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.859
I can't remember the last time there
were Cinemas that were sold out for a

428
00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:45.480
non-superhero movie for two movies at
once Barbie and Oppenheimer were sold

429
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.380
out today when I looked
um

430
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.839
and yeah I can't remember the last time
that a non-superhero movie

431
00:40:54.839 --> 00:41:00.359
was like crashing theaters like that
like it's kind of amazing and I am so

432
00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:05.880
happy to see it because I am I would
really love for the the Blockbuster to

433
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.960
shrink I would love for Blockbusters to
go down to

434
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.800
Barbie size
instead of you know

435
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.060
costing 300 and 400 million dollars like
some of the movies that came out this

436
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.180
year

437
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.359
what's an overrated Canadian city

438
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.160
um
I honestly haven't been to enough

439
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.300
Canadian cities to really say I'm gonna
say Ottawa out of all the cities that

440
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.560
I've the Canadian cities that I've been
in for any period of time

441
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.880
Ottawa is the most overrated

442
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.320
people are wearing pink like they're in
a cult including me it's like I I own no

443
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.700
pink stuff and even after I saw barbie I
went to a bunch of stores to see if they

444
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:17.099
had any like guy sized clothing
um with Barbie logos and stuff nothing

445
00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:21.720
nothing no Pink Guy clothing in the area
that I could find I need to go to a mall

446
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.440
and kind of look around I'm sure they
have it somewhere

447
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.480
nobody wants to see me in a crop top

448
00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:36.300
I loved Ottawa but only saw it for like
a week as a tourist and I love books and

449
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.560
museums oh I'm sure yeah like Ottawa
would be like great to visit but I lived

450
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.640
there for a year and I tried to I tried
to start several businesses in Ottawa

451
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.599
that involved casting people
and uh

452
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:54.300
people are very full of themselves in
Ottawa I have um

453
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.819
to the conclusion of
new patreon gold James and a crop

454
00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:04.440
five thousand patrons got us to 5 000
patrons get us to five thousand patrons

455
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.280
I'll do whatever you want

456
00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:16.260
off topic can you explain all the
history thing no I can't

457
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.760
[Laughter]
that was just a stream with me and Nick

458
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.900
and uh

459
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:31.560
that ended up happening and then Jason
made it into like a YouTube short and I

460
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.000
was like oh my God I have to post this

461
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.400
James dressed as Misty

462
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.819
I was tearing my closet apart for my
pink tank top for the Barbie movie

463
00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.960
soon the patrons shall control James's
fashion choices by all means if we get 5

464
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.839
000 patrons I will I if we get 5 000
patrons I will do a closet tour which

465
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:10.200
will be pretty pathetic because I don't
own very much clothing

466
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.300
um and I will let the patrons decide
like what colors of clothes I should buy

467
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.220
and everything I will I would and hand
over a lot of control for five thousand

468
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.700
patrons

469
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:32.280
assume the patron I just read that
will we see a gay inside closet

470
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.540
uh yeah I mean you've actually seen me
in a closet before technically it's my

471
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.680
editing closet it's where I have my
computer and everything but it is it is

472
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.280
a closet

473
00:44:44.339 --> 00:44:54.200
maybe into the screen for the anti-hero
coordiness of it all huh oh the oh okay

474
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.599
Barbie is showing at the drive in 30
minutes so I wish there was a drive in

475
00:44:57.599 --> 00:45:00.599
here I would totally go see Barbie to
draw I haven't been to a drive-in since

476
00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:05.099
I was like 16 years old
what movie no I haven't been to the

477
00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:10.680
drive-in since I was
12.

478
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:15.660
or 13. I think I was 12 there was a
double feature of Harry Potter and the

479
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:21.480
Philosopher's Stone and Jason X
and uh I was like oh my God I have to

480
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.940
see Jason X and so my mom took me and
we were there till like three in the

481
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.040
morning because Jason because Jason X
started really late

482
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.260
uh no I haven't seen Oppenheimer I'm
gonna see it when it comes to streaming

483
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.960
but I'm not gonna sit in the theater for
three hours just to be depressed

484
00:45:47.819 --> 00:45:52.319
I saw E.T in the at the drive-in as a
kid I'm old I saw a lot of movies in the

485
00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:58.800
drive-in as a kid I saw uh Jurassic Park
The Flintstones

486
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.920
um
the mask

487
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.020
what else did I see at the drive-in
Titanic

488
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.960
um oh what else did I see I I saw a lot
of movies at the drive-in we had a

489
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.579
drive-in where I lived and basically and
at in the summertime no one went to the

490
00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:18.440
movie theater we everybody went to the
drive-in

491
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.819
Jason X is better than a lot of the
other Friday the 13s it is it's a bad

492
00:46:23.819 --> 00:46:29.460
movie don't get me wrong but it's like a
it's like a of like a Showgirls kind of

493
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.140
bad movie it's impossible to not have
fun watching Jason X and there's some

494
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:39.000
Friday the 13th movies like part
four

495
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.900
four part five
um

496
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.700
part six it comes another way
I think it's part five is just bad I I

497
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.700
can't watch
Friday the 13th Part Five I have bad

498
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.020
memories of bar five
I'm 90 sure that it's part five that I'm

499
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.440
thinking of

500
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.420
also I did actually run a red light
speed

501
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:08.880
I used to do that
I used to drive very dangerously to a

502
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.980
remix an eight minute remix of Shut Up
and Drive

503
00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:18.119
yeah Jason Takes Manhattan is boring
until the last half hour of it like the

504
00:47:18.119 --> 00:47:20.940
whole thing on the boat and it's like
they didn't have the budget to actually

505
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:26.099
film in New York they had to film in
Vancouver they somehow got a boat from a

506
00:47:26.099 --> 00:47:29.099
lake
into the Atlantic Ocean

507
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:34.800
uh which just like completely destroys
any logic

508
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.660
um
but yeah Jason Takes Manhattan is uh my

509
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.920
favorite Friday the 13th is uh part
seven

510
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.400
it's because
I I stand an incredibly queer movie with

511
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.140
a girl with psychic powers

512
00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:07.619
it's in part five yeah part seven has
the psychic part five is the one with

513
00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:11.280
the fake Jason Jason's not even in part
five it's

514
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.819
um
a guy whose son was killed and he

515
00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:22.280
dresses up as Jason to kill people
Friday the 13th yes

516
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.619
I had such a crush on the main actor
when I was a kid I watched that movie so

517
00:48:28.619 --> 00:48:32.400
much
I used to live next to a drive-in where

518
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.400
all I had to do was get our radio
connected to the right signal and I

519
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.880
could watch a couple of movies from my
attic that's awesome

520
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:44.060
oh I'm jealous I would have been up
there every night

521
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.560
did you see the new trailer for season
two of Heart Stopper I did

522
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.619
um I think we're actually for the
patrons we're gonna do a watch along

523
00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:03.180
when Heart Stopper comes out
um it's probably gonna be my second time

524
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.440
viewing it because I will likely
watch it when it drops at three in the

525
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.740
morning
um

526
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.819
and then I'll like watch it again later
on that weekend with patrons or

527
00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:17.420
something like that

528
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.780
I'm so gay slay work boots

529
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:31.040
so Butch what I'm with guys like

530
00:49:31.339 --> 00:49:37.260
Medusa you're it's like
you're you're you're you're you're I was

531
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.800
gonna say your tweets tweets aren't a
thing anymore you're you're you're

532
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.480
you're posts are interesting

533
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.880
have you ever seen the classic lesbian
movie Heavenly Creatures I just found

534
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.540
out about it last week it's a lesbian
crime drama I have Heavenly Creatures is

535
00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:01.260
amazing uh it's actually the movie that
basically got Peter Jackson the job of

536
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.099
directing Lord of the Rings
um because they got an Oscar nomination

537
00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:08.880
for best I want to say best original
screenplay

538
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.180
um
and uh

539
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:18.319
yeah Heavenly Creatures is phenomenal
it's it's really really really good

540
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.319
um I did see the trailer for The One
Piece live action series and I thought

541
00:50:25.319 --> 00:50:32.359
it actually looks fun but I'm not gonna
watch it on because

542
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.339
I feel like I don't see I might watch it
like I don't know if it's a direct

543
00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:42.960
adaptation of the manga or if they're
just kind of running with it

544
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.420
um
is it something that I can watch that

545
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.740
will get me into one piece
or

546
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.460
that I can then check out the anime and
the manga afterwards or is it something

547
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.359
that's gonna be like

548
00:50:57.119 --> 00:51:03.059
kind of detached from it and then I'll
just get like I'll be confused or is it

549
00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:07.980
and the other excuse me the other issue
is unless it's super successful Netflix

550
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.460
will cancel it and we won't get a second
season and then it's like okay well how

551
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.400
are you gonna get the whole story of the
manga they're never gonna be able to

552
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.040
tell the whole story of the manga they
never let shows last that long

553
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.140
will probably be canceled like cat well
Cowboy Bebop was really bad

554
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.420
um
that was the problem with the Cowboy

555
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:35.160
Bebop live action
so we'll see what happens uh we'll see

556
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.000
what happens with this one

557
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.500
I have seen Dante's Cove I watched that
when I was a teenager

558
00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:57.059
it was made for people who don't want to
watch the anime and or read the Manga

559
00:51:57.059 --> 00:52:01.920
I'm interested in reading the manga and
watching the anime but it's just kind of

560
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.200
like
it is such a Time sink

561
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.619
that uh

562
00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:16.859
that it's like that's why I have it as a
a 10 000 Patron goal that a 10 000

563
00:52:16.859 --> 00:52:21.540
patrons we're gonna do a three hour
video about one piece

564
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.660
um

565
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.859
because it's it's gonna take
a lot of work and so we're gonna need 10

566
00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:32.540
000 patrons before we can do it

567
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:40.040
to Dante's Cove even have a plot or was
it just hot guys shirtless

568
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:47.359
that's a good question
because I don't remember one

569
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:57.380
oh I don't have my thing out here that
lets me rest my feet

570
00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:18.359
oh I've actually seen him before
I can't remember what I saw where I've

571
00:53:18.359 --> 00:53:24.440
seen him or what I've seen him in but
I've actually seen him before

572
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.359
reading the manga isn't that much of a
time commitment as watching the anime

573
00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:36.780
I've gotten through about half of the
manga in a few days of intense a few

574
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.500
days wow

575
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.819
my problem with reading especially like
manga and comic books and stuff like

576
00:53:44.819 --> 00:53:50.099
that is that I read the dialogue as I
imagine it would be spoken

577
00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:54.240
and so I'm like I'm like acting it out
in my head so it takes a long time for

578
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.599
me to read stuff
um I think that's why I read so slowly

579
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.859
I just put out the two the first two
volumes of the Sailor Moon manga

580
00:54:04.859 --> 00:54:09.660
yesterday
um at Toys R Us of all places

581
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:14.400
um to start my research on the
Revolutionary girl Lieutenant Sailor

582
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.940
Moon video that we're gonna work on uh
later in the summer

583
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.440
I take my time reading manga because I
like to really look at the art I usually

584
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.660
don't kind of fall in love with the art
of manga but with uh the summer Hikaru

585
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:42.420
died I've just been like engrossed in
the art of that

586
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:48.960
that series looks amazing it's stunning
like it's the best the best Manga art

587
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.740
I've ever seen granted I haven't read a
whole lot of manga

588
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.619
um but it's like the best art in a manga
that I've ever seen

589
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.780
for the magical girls video where you're
looking into Western influences of anime

590
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:18.599
and vice versa it's interesting how they
go back and forth uh we don't know yet

591
00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:23.940
um we have to sit down and watch
revolutionary girl lieutenant and uh

592
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.839
first we need to do the Sandman uh good
Omens video

593
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:32.839
and then we're gonna go into the magical
girls video

594
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.380
um it's really hard for me to say what a
video is about before we start writing

595
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:43.079
it because when we break the it we call
it it's like breaking the video is kind

596
00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:47.640
of figuring out exactly what's in it
um like we know that we're going to talk

597
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:52.440
about revolutionary girl lieutenant and
Sailor Moon that's about it

598
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.339
um
as far as the content of it the theme of

599
00:55:56.339 --> 00:56:02.460
it no idea like when we sat down to
write the when we decided let's make a

600
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.520
video about Hannibal we had no idea it
was about going to be about abusive

601
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.700
relationships
um and why gays love abusive

602
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.420
relationships
but that's what it ended up being after

603
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.079
writing it

604
00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:21.440
girl utensils

605
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.599
have you seen the movie The blackening
no I haven't but I really really want to

606
00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:32.099
it looks friggin hilarious
good it's good and it has a black gay

607
00:56:32.099 --> 00:56:36.780
man as a lead character he's also oh
that's uh is that on streaming yet I

608
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:40.380
know it was in theaters but it didn't
come I think I think it was in one

609
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.619
theater near me which I'm like I'm in
Toronto it should be every movie should

610
00:56:43.619 --> 00:56:48.059
come out near me God damn it there's
like eight theaters within like a 10

611
00:56:48.059 --> 00:56:52.260
minute drive from me
um

612
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:57.540
but uh I haven't seen it yet but I wanna
it's like that's on my like watch

613
00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.839
immediately as soon as it comes out on
streaming list

614
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:05.700
it is on streaming awesome
I wear it

615
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:10.640
hey Siri at 10 p.m remind me to watch
the blackening

616
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.000
I don't know if Siri made the

617
00:57:19.319 --> 00:57:23.960
wonderful
thank you Siri

618
00:57:25.079 --> 00:57:28.260
I don't look abusive relationships but I
love me some dark and twisted

619
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.980
relationships

620
00:57:34.859 --> 00:57:40.619
it's very telling that
three of our most viewed videos are

621
00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:45.480
about gay abusive relationships
I'm like should I just keep should I

622
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.640
just make videos about gay abusive
relationships

623
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.460
wow he's like really cute but then he
takes his shirt off and he's got like

624
00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:02.359
the chest of a 1980s wrestler holy

625
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.880
that's mind-boggling

626
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:17.460
it's not 10 over in Canada yet no it's
just about nine o'clock uh in Toronto

627
00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.900
and
um I usually stream for about two hours

628
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:26.040
these days so I'll probably finish at
about 10 o'clock

629
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.180
um but if I don't finish at 10 if I go
later or whatever my reminder will be

630
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.960
consistently on my phone so I will see
it and I can look it up and watch it

631
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.420
because a funny movie is exactly what I
need right now

632
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.540
as long as you don't go out and have
some for research has some for research

633
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:51.480
have oh I can't have any relationships
for research or for fun I'm I am

634
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.339
chronically single so

635
00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.579
it's weird for me to listen to people
talk to Siri like it's a real secretary

636
00:59:02.579 --> 00:59:08.099
I have apple
um speakers on every floor of my house

637
00:59:08.099 --> 00:59:13.920
so no matter where I am I can just call
out for to make a reminder

638
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:20.400
or to turn my TV on or to play a song or
whatever it's very convenient

639
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.980
um
also slightly dystopian but dystopian in

640
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.819
an acceptable way

641
00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:34.940
Medusa you could probably yeah you could
probably take Siri

642
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:44.400
I recommend the show killing Eve kind of
similar Vibes to Hannibal but has more

643
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.000
comedy and is you know everyone's been
telling me to watch killing Eve and

644
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.440
maybe that's the next
toxic queer relationship that we could

645
00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.799
cover and get lots of views for
Maybe

646
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:04.020
I changed my series name to computer
like Star Trek you can change Siri's

647
01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.980
name
I had no idea I knew like I have my

648
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.799
series sounding like a hot Australian
dude because I'm like you know if I had

649
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:16.200
an assistant uh that would absolutely be
where my what my assistant would be

650
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.440
um
I didn't know you could change Siri's

651
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.920
name though

652
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.280
the talent of getting the right fitting
yet deceiving clothing

653
01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:37.920
sexy Australian series sounds like it
sounds like a catch

654
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.520
Google assistant is really good but I
don't use it because it's Google yeah I

655
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.740
don't trust Google with anything I I
trust Apple because apple is like

656
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.359
notoriously
high on privacy

657
01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:55.700
um
like uh even like to the point where

658
01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:00.480
when the police brought I forget what
criminal it was they had done something

659
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.700
I think they were they bombed something
I can't remember the exact details

660
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:10.020
um but they were they the the FBI
brought them their phone and they said

661
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.020
we want into the phone and apple was
like um

662
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:17.400
find the password good luck best of luck
to you we're not opening the phone if we

663
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.400
open the phone for you for this
situation we're gonna have to open it

664
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.900
for another one we're not starting that

665
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.559
close
if you think about fastos from the Mt

666
01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:34.980
MCU
eternals in Oppenheimer have a beef with

667
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:41.599
each other yeah because fastos was
really the reason the bomb was created

668
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.760
Apple's primary product isn't user data
yeah that's what I like about Apple and

669
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.780
lots of people about Apple and I
completely understand why because of you

670
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.359
know
producing a lot of their stuff in

671
01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:57.780
basically sweatshops in China
um

672
01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:03.540
but like as far as their user agreement
goes it's the most user friendly of all

673
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.319
the tech companies

674
01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:10.859
like it likes it it I was gonna say it
likes people

675
01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:14.420
um
of all the corporations it has the most

676
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:20.520
respect for people I guess
um

677
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.380
like I trust it way more than I trust
Google

678
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.640
like when I when we're writing YouTube
videos we we use Google Docs for writing

679
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.680
those but when I'm writing stuff that
like I'm going to publish

680
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.700
um I use Apple products because I don't
want anything getting leaked for

681
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:44.180
anything that could potentially be money
down low Right Down the Line

682
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.780
so anyone know if

683
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.980
Peach killer is going to be

684
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.160
jillago Beach killer
I've heard of this person

685
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.559
I don't like Google or Apple I don't get
either it's so hard

686
01:03:10.559 --> 01:03:19.500
I do have a Google pixel phone as my uh
my company phone for Telos and that was

687
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.740
mostly because I was like I need a
company phone that is separate from my

688
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.180
phone so that actors can get in touch
with me and it not just be coming into

689
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.559
my normal system so I can separate work
and life

690
01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:33.680
um

691
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.059
but uh
I haven't really I we haven't done

692
01:03:39.059 --> 01:03:43.160
auditions yet so I haven't used it like
at all

693
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.740
although I'm excited for Wiccan and
hulkling to come into the MCU I hope

694
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:53.460
speed doesn't get sidelined he's often
forgotten treated like wiccan's twin bye

695
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.760
brother oh speed is definitely going to
be sidelined because I don't even think

696
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.780
they're going to bring in hulkling

697
01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:03.480
I think we're going to get Wiccan as a
gay character but he's not going to have

698
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.839
a boyfriend I think that's what they're
going to do

699
01:04:06.839 --> 01:04:12.119
currently that is my
that is my opinion on it hopefully I'm

700
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.460
wrong
but I have no faith in anything Disney

701
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.619
does he's so cute

702
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.359
look at his cheeks he's so cute how old
is he

703
01:04:24.359 --> 01:04:28.160
22. okay I'm allowed to say he's cute

704
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.119
I made the mistake of getting a Google
pixel 7 Pro what a piece of junk on my

705
01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:41.880
oh wow really I think that's what I got
well whatever the most recent Google

706
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.920
pixel is is the one I got makes really
good pictures takes really good pictures

707
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.280
really good video too I was really
surprised because apple is usually like

708
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.180
Primo with the video but the pixel
actually does better low light video

709
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.660
especially

710
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:04.140
I could easily take you I'd like to take
Joe Locke

711
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.240
I hope Christopher Nolan directs the
next Bond I saw today that Greta Gerwig

712
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.720
said that she'd love to direct a Bond
movie and I was like that would be such

713
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.099
a kick in the nuts if the next Bond
movie was directed by Greta Gerwig

714
01:05:17.099 --> 01:05:20.940
whereas where Christopher Nolan is
basically begging Barbara broccoli to

715
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.200
hire him that would be such a kick in
the nuts to Nolan uh I would actually

716
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.859
love to see Nolan direct a Bond movie
because Barbara broccoli would come in

717
01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:33.720
and say okay
uh great Direction wonderful we're gonna

718
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.520
do the the fine touches on the audio and
stuff like that

719
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.359
I think Oakland will be introduced but
once both are adults to avoid the queer

720
01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:47.160
youth exist rhetoric I don't I don't
know

721
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.359
I have no faith I've lost all faith in
Marvel like I I haven't watched anything

722
01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:57.720
from Marvel since
I watched She-Hulk I like She-Hulk

723
01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.660
um
that was the last Marvel thing I watched

724
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.859
I haven't had any interest in anything
else that's been coming out for Marvel

725
01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:06.920
um

726
01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:12.359
and uh
I am gonna watch uh Agatha coven of

727
01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:17.099
chaos when that comes out specifically
because Marvel has not said that Joe

728
01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:22.140
Locke is playing Wiccan and I'm still
not sure he is

729
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:26.280
I still think he might be playing
Nicholas scratch

730
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.819
um and so I'm gonna watch it to see if
he's actually playing Wiccan or not

731
01:06:35.819 --> 01:06:40.799
who is more to blame for the
Marvel or Disney Disney

732
01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:47.940
Marvel is run by a progressive executive
who uh has been pushing for more

733
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.319
um representation for queer people and
people of color in the comic books

734
01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:56.160
um that's Kevin feige Disney has been
the one pushing back against that kind

735
01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.280
of against any kind of queer
representation in the movies that can't

736
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.660
be edited out for China
um Disney is the one the first that

737
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.260
forced Marvel to produce more movies
that force them to do a bunch of Disney

738
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.119
Plus shows that basically stretched the
Marvel Brand thin it is Disney's fault I

739
01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:17.039
don't blame Kevin feige until a reason
for me to blame Kevin foggy is given I

740
01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:20.480
will give him the benefit of the doubt

741
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.020
I'd only watch Marvel movies nowadays if
they include the X-Men or Spider-Man

742
01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:35.700
I haven't bothered with the camera the
phone won't maintain the signal oh Wi-Fi

743
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.480
or mobile I'm glad you're not having
issues with it everyone else I know is

744
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.460
having nothing but problems with it oh
wow

745
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.460
maybe I don't have the newest one again
I barely used it

746
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.400
um
I've mostly used it to play Nintendo DS

747
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.740
games
to be honest

748
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:10.579
oh thank you Bastion I got these uh from
Zenni it's a on online glasses place

749
01:08:11.099 --> 01:08:16.199
my pixel 7A hasn't maybe I have a 7A or
maybe I don't have a 7 Pro

750
01:08:16.199 --> 01:08:20.279
I have a pixel I know that
and it has a really good low light

751
01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:24.779
camera that's that's about the
the gist of it it's been sitting on my

752
01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:30.120
my bedside table for weeks because I've
just I got it and I was like

753
01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.560
we haven't started casting yet and like
actually casting yet and so I haven't

754
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.239
had to give out the number to anyone yet

755
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.020
I subscribe to title because Spotify
raised their subscription again and the

756
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.460
audio quality is really good
I forgot title was a thing I subscribed

757
01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:01.259
to Apple music again because it's
I can just tell Siri to play a song and

758
01:09:01.259 --> 01:09:05.819
the song plays I think you can do that
through Spotify but I I never got onto

759
01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:08.400
Spotify
actually I think I do have a Spotify

760
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.359
subscription
why do I have a Spotify subscription

761
01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:20.339
totally unrelated but have you read the
Pawn's Revenge it's a gay webcomic

762
01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:26.719
similar to killing stalking I have never
heard of the Pawn's Revenge

763
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.239
ongoing model had 54 chapters

764
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.140
published by Legion
as a male as a male prostitute in the

765
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:52.140
slum Geo is at the bottom of the social
hierarchy upon among pawns sure he's

766
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.100
tired sure he's tried to break away but
each attempt has only left him with more

767
01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.719
wounds until one day he gets rescued by
a serial killer who kidnaps him along

768
01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:06.300
with his pimp the Killer song rock is on
a mission for his lover a former

769
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:12.120
prostitute plotting to turn the tables
why he rescues J.O is unclear but a

770
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.860
slick talking man was definitely
not part of anyone's plan regardless J.O

771
01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:20.940
is no ordinary Pawn now that he has
entered the game he will use every trick

772
01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.900
up his sleeve or in his pants to get
revenge

773
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:30.199
oh I must read this I must read this

774
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.199
this is necessary reading

775
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.960
yes yes yes thank you for bringing that
up to me

776
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.620
although I'm excited for Blue Beetle I
don't think it will make much money at

777
01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:12.840
the box office hopefully it will be a
hit on streaming similar to Encanto

778
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.080
um

779
01:11:18.179 --> 01:11:22.620
I think the reason it's not going to be
a hit is because I agree it's not going

780
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.100
to be a hit I don't think and it's not
because of the quality of the movie it's

781
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:31.739
because people are just so over DC now
that they have no faith in any of the

782
01:11:31.739 --> 01:11:35.940
stuff that's coming out and the
basically DC is getting a soft reboot

783
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:40.080
with James Gunn Superman movie
um which will happen eventually when the

784
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.480
strikes are over
um

785
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.260
and I think the D I think DC fans will
kind of go back and check that out but

786
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.640
for now I think DC is basically on hold
which is real for Aquaman because

787
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.219
they spent like 300 million dollars on
Aquaman too and that's supposed to come

788
01:11:53.219 --> 01:11:55.940
out in December

789
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:11.040
yeah DC keeps making
movies that out of characters nobody

790
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.540
knows who they are it's confusing

791
01:12:18.659 --> 01:12:22.140
kind of a lovely person with such a rich
storytelling voice highly recommend it

792
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:27.260
just don't
get her talking it will take a while

793
01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:38.000
oh thank you Katie dog

794
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.320
oh thank you Earl uh we're actually we
released the first teaser poster

795
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.920
for telos's first movie uh to
the Indiegogo supporters

796
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.140
last night I think or the night before

797
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.179
Greta Gerwig directed A James Bond movie
we would either get the first female

798
01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:13.800
Bond or Bond would still be a man but it
would be re but it would be structured

799
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.159
like Fury Road
I would actually love to see a James

800
01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:20.659
Bond Fury Road type movie

801
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:26.880
Fury Road was so good
that was so freaking good

802
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.500
I still can't believe it didn't win best
picture

803
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.840
I have no interest in the Marvels

804
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.560
which is sad because I actually liked
the first Captain Marvel I really like

805
01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.500
Maria is
it's Maria Rambo right

806
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:04.640
I think so
um

807
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:12.739
but and I feel bad for saying this
the actress who plays Ms Marvel

808
01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:20.100
seems so at least in the trailers seems
so annoying to me

809
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.960
like
really grading

810
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.120
and
like the screeches and stuff and I get

811
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.020
that it's supposed to be like a fangirl
thing and stuff like that but I'm I just

812
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:38.300
I feel I'm like I don't think I could
watch that

813
01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.500
Monica right Maria's her mom right sorry
will you be discussing queer rap and

814
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.640
coding in the Barbie movie uh we talked
we did a podcast about the Barbie movie

815
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.480
so I don't expect there to be a video
about it

816
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.260
um
unless it like around Oscar season maybe

817
01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.080
if it gets like a bunch of nominations
but uh

818
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.320
the
it's just kind of like one sentence

819
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.179
to talk about the queer rep in the
Barbie movie it's like you know there's

820
01:15:27.179 --> 01:15:31.380
lots of queer actors in the movie which
is very appreciated

821
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.340
um no Real Queer characters though
except arguably Alan I would argue that

822
01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.719
Alan's queer character
excuse me

823
01:15:39.719 --> 01:15:44.940
um but other than Alan all the Barbies
and Ken's do kind of have a pair

824
01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.060
um

825
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:52.920
but uh it's obviously super queer
friendly because every gay I know

826
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.480
went to see it this weekend

827
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.820
I'm gonna patiently wait for Telos to
release something and use every inch of

828
01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:13.640
my being to advertise it you will be sad
upon by the wealthy verse I swear this

829
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.480
oh maybe we should add a furry character
to the first movie then

830
01:16:21.659 --> 01:16:25.679
I literally there's two white boards up
on the wall right beside me that are a

831
01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:29.219
breakdown of the movie and its
characters and everything

832
01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:34.380
um because it's kind of a murder mystery
and so we had to like really get into

833
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.280
detail of who knows who who wants to
kill who who like everyone has a motive

834
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.860
kind of thing
um

835
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.699
and

836
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.320
I'm like oh maybe we should make one of
them a furry

837
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.739
oh rule 34 the hell out of it well the
actors might not like it but

838
01:17:04.739 --> 01:17:08.400
maybe I'll put no I can't put that in
the contract

839
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.880
but you know I don't think any of the
actors that I'm talking to no one's

840
01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.780
famous
so I think you know I don't think anyone

841
01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:19.580
would complain about getting a fan base

842
01:17:21.719 --> 01:17:27.320
Alan could be midge's baby's father Alan
ain't no bother

843
01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:37.760
I like the way you think Bastion I like
the way you think

844
01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.560
imagine if gretoker wig made a Bond film
from the perspective of a Bond girl

845
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.540
oh that would actually be really good
I want to see that movie

846
01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:52.560
even if it's not Bond if it's just like
a movie from the perspective of the bond

847
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.520
of the the stereotypical Bond girl I
think it would be so interesting

848
01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.500
especially the ones that are also
villains

849
01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:07.199
Alan about to have his whole era
honestly I've always kind of found

850
01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:13.920
Michael Sarah cute and particularly cute
as Alan so I mean I would

851
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.520
you know

852
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.820
still don't think Michael Sarah is an
actual actor they just leave him in

853
01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:28.280
movie sets and he acts like his normal
self

854
01:18:30.659 --> 01:18:35.100
Bond girl does sound like a a cool title
for a movie

855
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:41.040
although if it wasn't actually made by
uh

856
01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.580
Barbara broccoli
um

857
01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.780
you probably get hit pretty hard with a
copyright claim not copyright claim

858
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:53.179
you'd be taken to court wouldn't just be
like YouTube

859
01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.080
on the way home from the Barbie movie
one of my friends made a really good

860
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.100
case for Alan being non-binary coded
absolutely since all the girls are

861
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.699
Barbie and all the guys are Ken making
Alan a sort of third gender absolutely I

862
01:19:17.699 --> 01:19:21.360
immediately read Alan as non-binary
um

863
01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.719
because you know he's he's not a Ken but
he's kind of a guy but he's on the side

864
01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:33.659
with the Barbies and so I immediately
like because it is very much like black

865
01:19:33.659 --> 01:19:38.159
and white gender coding and Alan is just
in the is the one in the middle I

866
01:19:38.159 --> 01:19:44.159
immediately read Alan as as non-binary
and he's also I think the only Ken that

867
01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:47.219
wears makeup
like he has like eyeliner on and

868
01:19:47.219 --> 01:19:51.780
foundation and stuff
hearing magic Ken and sugar daddy Ken

869
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.580
where the gay discontinued dolls
earring earring magic can absolutely I

870
01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:02.219
wish that they had gotten like
like Chris Evans to be Aaron hearing

871
01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:07.080
magic can or something like that
Collingwood John Cena showed up as a

872
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.140
mermaid
which is like a fever dream I was like

873
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.679
what the

874
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:31.140
I was actually watching the first Bond
movie oh the first first one is Dr no

875
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.940
right I think the first one is Doctor no

876
01:20:36.719 --> 01:20:40.739
I didn't know John Cena is in the movie
so when he I didn't know he was in it

877
01:20:40.739 --> 01:20:44.640
either like I had seen pictures of him
as a mermaid and I thought that it was

878
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.000
just like a funny photo shoot he had
done or something and then he popped up

879
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.360
in Barbie and I was like what
by watching

880
01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.980
Bastion honestly like I feel like I need
to see it again because I'm like did I

881
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:07.280
like I'm epileptic did I have a seizure
and imagine this movie happened

882
01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.239
I'd initially assume Scott Evans would
be playing one of the queer kittens

883
01:21:15.239 --> 01:21:19.380
since they've had him talking to the
queer yeah so did I

884
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.840
um and I mean he and nagurigawa
um who were both gay they they both

885
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:30.840
kissed Ryan Gosling in the movie so
that's that that's the gay male

886
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.159
representation there
this is

887
01:21:35.159 --> 01:21:40.800
I just love that like they're like
they went for it with the uh

888
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.600
the you know like
the Barbies of all different races and

889
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.940
different you know body sizes and like
obviously you know like stereotypical

890
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.140
Barbie was the main character but all
the other Barbies kind of had equal

891
01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:01.040
screen time and I really really like
that I really appreciated that

892
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:14.159
Ursula Andress called Dr No a crappy
Thriller I mean none of the the early

893
01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:18.000
Bond movies are considered Classics but
I don't think any of them are

894
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.140
particularly good movies
like I don't think that there was

895
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:30.980
actually like a good Bond movie like
good on the the level of like

896
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.739
um

897
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.699
when I say good I mean like I I love the
Bond movies I've seen them all multiple

898
01:22:38.699 --> 01:22:42.960
times
um I was obsessed with Jaws the

899
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.199
character Jaws when I was a kid
um

900
01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:51.480
but I don't think the first like
actually legitimately

901
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:56.699
like
could be considered award-worthy

902
01:22:56.699 --> 01:23:01.219
Bond movie happened until Casino Royale

903
01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.600
my favorite movie is an absolute
dumpster fire but it's my dumpster fire

904
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.659
do you have a favorite Alan Moore comic
or movie based on an Alan Moore comic uh

905
01:23:21.659 --> 01:23:24.960
movie based on an Alan Moore comic would
be V for Vendetta because I think that's

906
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.179
the only one he hasn't disowned
um and I think V for Vendetta may

907
01:23:30.179 --> 01:23:36.300
actually be my favorite Alan Moore comic
comic as well watchman's really good

908
01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:40.620
um
and the killing joke but I think I think

909
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.060
V for Vendetta is my favorite one

910
01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.920
shocking I go for the one with the queer
representation

911
01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.540
who would have thought for me of all
people

912
01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.840
foreign

913
01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.620
tattoos and short hair

914
01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.340
I think there are a lot of comics he
hasn't disowned but they're not the

915
01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:18.300
superhero ones
I don't think he's I don't know how many

916
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:23.760
Comics he's disowned but he's disowned
most of the movies made from his comics

917
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.780
I think V for Vendetta is the only one
that he hasn't the V for Vendetta movie

918
01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:31.679
is the only one that he has an
outrightly disowned

919
01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:34.580
I might be wrong though

920
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.900
oh am I Frozen
says excellent connection

921
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.580
oh
I see why

922
01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:18.140
oh dear my camera battery died one sec

923
01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.800
thank you

924
01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.679
camera should be returning to action any
moment now

925
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.780
or not

926
01:26:15.179 --> 01:26:21.080
I'm gonna move you in there
then do that we

927
01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.780
okay should be good to go now sorry
about that

928
01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:33.239
this
to for context this is the battery that

929
01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:39.000
I'm running my webcam off of it's not a
webcam it's a Sony a74 but I'm running

930
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.360
it off of this
because it's weird

931
01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.679
what celebrity have you met that's rude
and another who's nice I've never met

932
01:26:58.679 --> 01:27:03.920
any celebrities who aren't wrestlers
actually

933
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:10.260
in person I've met porn stars but only
online I've talked to them but I've

934
01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.699
never actually like

935
01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.219
um
met any actors

936
01:27:17.219 --> 01:27:20.060
or celebrities

937
01:27:21.239 --> 01:27:24.360
do you think we'll get a comic book
adaptation of gentlemen's club it

938
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:29.820
actually started as a comic book
Nick wrote it as a comic book and a

939
01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.000
friend of mine was going to do the art
for it but then it just this was years

940
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.139
ago year this was like 2016.
um

941
01:27:37.139 --> 01:27:42.719
but then it kind of 2016 or 2015.
um but then it kind of fell through and

942
01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:46.800
Nick rewrote it as a novel
and

943
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.500
like I think Nick would love to have a
gentleman's club as a comic book as like

944
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.420
a graphic novel
um but artists are expensive and so it

945
01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:02.940
would be it would cost a lot to get it
adapted into a graphic novel and Nick is

946
01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:07.139
so so very precious with the stuff in
the book that he wouldn't want to lose

947
01:28:07.139 --> 01:28:11.600
anything so adapting it would be pretty
difficult

948
01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.020
you do this you do that the pencil is in
panel 44 are too loose kind of thing

949
01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:58.520
industry phrase the person who typesets
organizes the panels and directs a team

950
01:28:58.739 --> 01:29:02.280
I have no I I don't know anything about
Comics

951
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.340
um

952
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.920
I know more about like manga and manwa
and that's because it's basically all

953
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.460
done by one person
um

954
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.840
so yeah I don't know
how it would work but it's something

955
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.699
that Nick's Nick wanted it to be a comic
book like he was really excited of

956
01:29:20.699 --> 01:29:25.080
having like a trans superhero out there
like a trans mask superhero out there in

957
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:30.900
the comic space uh who wasn't defined
like he's the trans superhero

958
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:34.380
um like that's not what defines him as a
character

959
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.560
um
and then uh

960
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.360
the comic book thing didn't work but
then you know wrote it as a book a

961
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.440
really good book Link in the description
if you want to read it

962
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:50.159
um it is available through most
bookstores

963
01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:55.739
um most easily through Amazon but also
most bookstores and uh

964
01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:59.300
it's it's a lot of fun

965
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:13.679
if Telos ever wants to break into that
market count me in 12 years and on of

966
01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:18.420
comics and art
I'll be interesting because Telos

967
01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:23.219
published Avalon night before Telos was
a production company

968
01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:27.679
um
so it's uh

969
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.800
it would be interesting to break into
the comic space

970
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.600
I just got a new Kindle Rafael it
actually was my my first Kindle

971
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.080
um I've never had a Kindle before I've
had like iPads and stuff and I've used

972
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.000
the Kindle app but I found the Kindle
itself I got the paper white one

973
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.739
it's it's so light obviously much
lighter than the books I read and I've

974
01:30:49.739 --> 01:30:52.020
actually gotten back into reading
because of it

975
01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:55.860
excuse me I'm finishing reading iron
Widow which I got like 50 pages into

976
01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:59.400
iron Widow the book
excuse me months and months and months

977
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.000
ago
and uh

978
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
but never finished it and now I'm
finishing it and I'm really enjoying it

979
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.500
oh you also got the paper white it's
really nice Nick bought one yesterday uh

980
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:26.040
ordered one yesterday the Oasis one it's
like bigger and has buttons and stuff

981
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:32.159
I'm like I'm I'm fine with my little one
because he was like I I

982
01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:37.159
need to focus on something I need I need
books

983
01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:29.780
did everything freeze again
what is going on with YouTube right now

984
01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.620
the American Gods graphic novel could
have been awesome but we'd have to get

985
01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.600
Sam Keith out of retirement
it's funny that if the graphic that the

986
01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.040
graphic novel of American Gods wouldn't
be great considering Neil Gaiman started

987
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:03.719
writing graphic novels well comic books
um

988
01:33:03.719 --> 01:33:11.000
your roommates are watching the feud
oh the Family Feud

989
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:18.060
new name for you pods

990
01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:22.560
I got pod
I'm not gonna try and pronounce the rest

991
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.860
of it

992
01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.679
that's Merc

993
01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.739
oh God
there's a picture of him in a white tank

994
01:33:37.739 --> 01:33:41.040
top where he's like holding up the
bottom of the tank top with his mouth

995
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:47.120
and I'm like
well that's my new fetish right there

996
01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.500
[Music]

997
01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:03.000
I miss Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage
when they were wrapping up The Rock

998
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.080
I forgot the rock was a thing I saw that
I thought it was another drive-in movie

999
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.940
I saw
on my vacation in San Francisco lost

1000
01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:17.520
our res at a restaurant because they
came in oh reservation

1001
01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.400
when they found out they paid for oh
that was nice of them

1002
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:28.100
just Resurrection paddles and zap him in
the butt wake UPS

1003
01:34:36.659 --> 01:34:41.580
that is really cool I've never met like
any like celebrity celebrities

1004
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:45.060
I've gotten to know a couple of porn
stars who are like

1005
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:50.280
you would think the porn stars are like
detached because they're so hot but then

1006
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.920
like at least some of the one I've
talked to some who are

1007
01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:00.780
uh just
not great

1008
01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.100
um but I've gotten to meet some who are
well talk to some who are like absolute

1009
01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.699
sweethearts

1010
01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.960
I'm thinking about casting one in the
movie

1011
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.580
because he's a particularly good actor

1012
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.000
and now Nicholas Cage is a horror icon
Nicholas Cage is an icon of all things

1013
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.380
AKA

1014
01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:52.500
I wish more gay porn stars could cross
over to mainstream since some are

1015
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.860
actually quite good they are and there's
actually a character in the movie We're

1016
01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:59.760
making who is a gay porn star uh there's
two of them actually but one of them

1017
01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.159
dies
um

1018
01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:06.420
and so it's like it would just kind of
make sense to cast

1019
01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:11.340
a porn star as the role because then you
know he's not gonna feel

1020
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:14.520
self-conscious walking around in his
underwear

1021
01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.880
um
but can he play an airhead is the

1022
01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.580
question
uh

1023
01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.780
I will have to
run it by him once we start doing

1024
01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:29.880
casting
which pornstar is the best actor that's

1025
01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.739
that's a difficult question
um Sean Ford is a surprisingly good

1026
01:36:34.739 --> 01:36:38.600
actor
um

1027
01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:42.600
uh oh crap
uh Blake Mitchell

1028
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.199
is also
I think Blake Mitchell I would say is

1029
01:36:46.199 --> 01:36:49.380
probably the best actor
of all the at least of the gay porn

1030
01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:52.679
stars
like Blake Mitchell is a surprisingly

1031
01:36:52.679 --> 01:36:56.100
talented actor
um

1032
01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:00.000
he actually was trying to break into
acting for a while but all the casting

1033
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.120
directors were like ew you did porn
gross blue

1034
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.060
and I'm like he looks like a heartthrob
and can act what are you doing

1035
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.480
so

1036
01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.260
we shall see we'll see what happens

1037
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.120
I meant pink she came into the
restaurant I worked in and hung out with

1038
01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.120
us for a few hours before going to her
concert that's really cool

1039
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:35.040
I promise this is not a fetish question
it's a great way to start a question uh

1040
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.239
would you ever date a guy with
incontinence like maybe they're kind of

1041
01:37:39.239 --> 01:37:45.300
sickly but still worth being with even
with stuff that isn't convenient like

1042
01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.440
incontinence like they fart

1043
01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:54.540
because if it's just farting
I've had a lot of friends who just fart

1044
01:37:54.540 --> 01:38:00.920
all the time
have you been friends with straight boys

1045
01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:23.719
I can play an airhead some say I've done
my whole life

1046
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:33.139
no I haven't seen swallowed that
that sounds like quite a uh

1047
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.739
quite a title for a movie

1048
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:44.480
incontinence is can't hold in p
oh

1049
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.719
I mean sure I know some people who who
kind of like especially when they laugh

1050
01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:53.159
they can't really hold in their pee
it's only p

1051
01:38:53.159 --> 01:38:56.760
and I mean if they were a really really
nice person

1052
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.360
like

1053
01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.920
I think my my expectations for how nice
a boyfriend is supposed to be is

1054
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.340
probably too high but
maybe that's why I'm single

1055
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:23.280
Sean Ford is multi-talented
Sean Ford is probably one of the most

1056
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.840
beautiful men I've ever seen
honestly I I'm not joking like he's got

1057
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:33.620
this Botticelli Angel type face it's
it's

1058
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.659
almost like inhuman

1059
01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.940
it's like you'd think like wow he's
beautiful he must be an

1060
01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:50.420
no and that that's what makes it even
worse he's like really nice

1061
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.639
the porn stars that most of the porn
stars I have gotten to talk to are nicer

1062
01:39:56.639 --> 01:40:00.500
than most of the like
like the porn stars who are like a 10

1063
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:06.480
are way nicer
than the guys I've talked to who are

1064
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.620
like us a five

1065
01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:13.920
not all of them some porn stars are
actual

1066
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.340
um
one's name is uh

1067
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.760
PF I'm gonna say I'm going to say p f
I'm not going to say his actual name uh

1068
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.420
but he he is a
he's a piece of work

1069
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:34.560
human pee only smells after a while
fresh it smells like nothing unless

1070
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.920
depends on their
um

1071
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.880
their uh diet I think if you have like
asparagus your pee stinks

1072
01:40:47.219 --> 01:40:51.260
Sean Ford's everything isn't fair at all

1073
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.199
yeah yeah

1074
01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:11.840
now I'm wondering who has the initials
of PF

1075
01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.840
oh Dolly V you can't be that homophobic
you've been a subscriber for at least

1076
01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:21.320
three days

1077
01:41:22.679 --> 01:41:29.540
or else you wouldn't be allowed to
chat in this chat

1078
01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.540
as a kinkster you'd be surprised how
often dieting comes into the lifestyle

1079
01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:42.480
fun fact if you want to taste good lots
of pineapple absolutely I have not had a

1080
01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.880
boyfriend or any kind of regular sexual
activity for about a decade but I

1081
01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:56.219
actually love pineapple and so you know
nice bonus for anyone who you know

1082
01:41:56.219 --> 01:41:59.659
wants to date me I guess

1083
01:42:00.119 --> 01:42:07.159
I don't eat a lot of red meat and I love
pineapple

1084
01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:17.179
I know who you're talking about and yes
he is

1085
01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:24.920
always ready with pineapple

1086
01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:30.480
can you believe I've never seen Ron
Jeremy's singapob I don't think I've

1087
01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:35.100
actually seen Ron Jeremy's thingama Bob
to be honest I haven't watched a lot of

1088
01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.000
straight porn so

1089
01:42:38.699 --> 01:42:42.239
pineapple is really good for when you're
craving sweets and it's super high in

1090
01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:47.040
fiber so it completely like deletes the
amount of sugar in it

1091
01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.340
so if you're like trying to do like
ketogenic stuff pineapple is actually

1092
01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:56.719
really good because the fiber intake
is higher than the carb intake

1093
01:43:03.119 --> 01:43:08.760
pineapple does pineapple really make
someone taste good and how so

1094
01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.080
um it does I don't know how but it's the
same way like if someone smokes they

1095
01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.639
theirs is going to taste bad if someone
eats a lot of red meat like steak theirs

1096
01:43:17.639 --> 01:43:22.020
is going to taste bad
um and for some reason if they eat a lot

1097
01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:27.420
of pineapple and I think Peaches I know
pineapple for sure but I think peaches

1098
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:29.580
um it makes it taste good for some
reason

1099
01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:34.340
couldn't tell you why
but apparently it does

1100
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:44.159
why do I sinus infection I hate
oh I hate I've had sinus infections oh

1101
01:43:44.159 --> 01:43:48.060
God sinus infections are the worst
especially the ones where you just smell

1102
01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.440
bad stuff all the time

1103
01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.100
kind of surprised though James is kind
of

1104
01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:06.600
Kansas are underperforming I'm also
really I have major body insecurities so

1105
01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.139
even though like I could show you like
I'm on a couple of the apps I'm on hinge

1106
01:44:10.139 --> 01:44:15.000
for instance and there's some guys on
hinge who look like friggin models who

1107
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.739
are like like Grayson you you could be
sending me their pictures like that's

1108
01:44:19.739 --> 01:44:24.659
that's what they look like like they are
beautiful and they're very friendly and

1109
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:30.300
they want to meet and I am very very
insecure about meeting them because I'm

1110
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:34.260
like oh once they actually see me in
person they're gonna really change their

1111
01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:38.219
mind and yes I'm in therapy and I'm
trying to deal with that

1112
01:44:38.219 --> 01:44:41.580
um
but uh

1113
01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:47.480
so I'm also you know it's also partially
my fault

1114
01:44:54.900 --> 01:45:00.719
tomatoes for tomatoes for volume garlic
for aftertaste water for hydration and

1115
01:45:00.719 --> 01:45:05.639
Gatorade for consistency hi I'm your
local internet freak and has been

1116
01:45:05.639 --> 01:45:09.860
what Gatorade for consistency

1117
01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.900
I love lemon lime Gatorade I could live
off of it but it's really high in sugar

1118
01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:29.340
my dad when when I was really little my
dad worked in a garage before he before

1119
01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:33.179
a car fell on him and he broke his back
in his neck and um

1120
01:45:33.179 --> 01:45:35.880
I would go over there and the other guys
who worked there would just give me

1121
01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:40.739
Gatorade because they knew I absolutely
loved lemon lime Gatorade

1122
01:45:40.739 --> 01:45:45.659
and one day I took one without asking
and my mom was like you stole that and I

1123
01:45:45.659 --> 01:45:50.340
I thought I was going to jail because
you know three or four years old and she

1124
01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:54.360
made me go over and apologize to them
and then they like all went out and

1125
01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:59.659
bought like a crate of lemon-like
Gatorade for me

1126
01:46:13.679 --> 01:46:18.360
there is a Bellamy movie called pina
colada and I discovered it before the

1127
01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.739
drinks whatever it does

1128
01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:25.020
foreign

1129
01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:32.540
I discovered a lot of stuff in porn
before I knew it was real

1130
01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:37.500
I call multiple pieces of asparagus
asparagus

1131
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.060
God geese are horrifying

1132
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:48.060
though I've never had asparagus
I'm not big on vegetables that's not

1133
01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:51.119
true I do like some vegetables I like
broccoli I like

1134
01:46:51.119 --> 01:46:53.179
um

1135
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.440
um lettuce
tomato a vegetable or a fruit I don't

1136
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.520
know if anyone's ever decided that
um

1137
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.540
I like celery

1138
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:15.360
porn lied to me about those things
straight porn like lied to me about the

1139
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.580
instantaneousness of female orgasms

1140
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:29.100
I've only done the female thing once but
apparently I was good at it

1141
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:33.860
tomato is a fruit and yellow watermelon
is actually a vegetable really

1142
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:37.320
watermelon is another thing that I could
just live off of

1143
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:43.040
I could absolutely just eat watermelon
ever for every meal of the day

1144
01:47:44.699 --> 01:47:49.440
but being in a relatively cold climate
it's almost never in season so you can

1145
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.980
really only get it in the summer or you
can get it in the winter but it's super

1146
01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.639
expensive

1147
01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:01.219
right in front of my salad

1148
01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:08.040
I hate that I forget his name now the
bottom in that scene ended up being a

1149
01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.639
trump supporter

1150
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:22.860
have you played at Astra the incredible
furry sci-fi Slow Burn erotic political

1151
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:25.639
romance job

1152
01:48:25.739 --> 01:48:30.920
uh no
I can't say that I have

1153
01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.800
I'm not good with visual not it sounds
like a visual novel I'm not good with

1154
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.760
visual novels
I'm not good with like any video games

1155
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:42.000
with a lot of dialogue like I've been
trying to play Final Fantasy 16 and

1156
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.980
there's just too much talking so I can't
get into it

1157
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:52.139
do you have an alternative for Twitter I
sure do I'm on blue sky I'm on threads

1158
01:48:52.139 --> 01:49:01.260
I'm on Instagram I'm on Tumblr
um there's the uh the other thing the

1159
01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:05.040
Discord
I'm on all the things

1160
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.460
the only thing I'm not on is Facebook
oddly

1161
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:13.100
um but yeah I'm on all the things I'm
just waiting for Twitter to die

1162
01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:27.060
are bye guys more likely to be switch
what's the difference is is there a

1163
01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:30.619
difference between verse and switch

1164
01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.199
I'm not on Blue Sky because they don't
fight

1165
01:49:37.199 --> 01:49:42.119
yeah I got uh someone
um one of

1166
01:49:42.119 --> 01:49:47.280
um my subscribers was very nice enough
to give me a blue sky invite and I've

1167
01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.659
since gotten two invites I gave one to
Nick obviously and I gave one to another

1168
01:49:51.659 --> 01:49:57.000
subscriber but as my invites come in I
will be posting

1169
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.480
um
on uh

1170
01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.800
uh Twitter
so if you follow me on Twitter

1171
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:10.920
um I will be posting when I get invites
uh as they come in so that I can help

1172
01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.340
more people get over to Blue Sky I think
it's actually a kind of a brilliant move

1173
01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.300
because threads kind of blew up and then
died immediately because everyone

1174
01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:22.739
realized that oh this is
you know giving

1175
01:50:22.739 --> 01:50:30.179
Mark Zuckerberg more power which he's
one of the Lesser evil Tech guys but

1176
01:50:30.179 --> 01:50:34.739
um
uh threads was also kind of undercooked

1177
01:50:34.739 --> 01:50:37.820
and uh

1178
01:50:38.699 --> 01:50:42.960
so it doesn't didn't you would think the
integration with Instagram would make it

1179
01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.380
easy but
I have way more Instagram followers than

1180
01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.619
I do threads
but uh

1181
01:50:49.619 --> 01:50:54.239
I think Blue Sky being exclusive when it
does go public it's gonna have all the

1182
01:50:54.239 --> 01:50:58.199
stuff ready to go and I think it's going
to be I think it's going to kind of

1183
01:50:58.199 --> 01:51:01.820
hopefully blow up and take out Twitter

1184
01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.600
if Elon doesn't do it first

1185
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:13.500
switch is about place in dominance you
can bottom and be dominant verse is

1186
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:19.440
for your preferred insert YouTube safe
innuendo here position while doing it

1187
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.639
okay okay

1188
01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.900
can't play Zelda on a verse

1189
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.420
if only Tumblr improved and returned to
its former glory

1190
01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:46.679
I honestly I've never really used Tumblr
I've kind of I've been getting I've been

1191
01:51:46.679 --> 01:51:51.179
using it a bit more now although I saw a
horrifying thing on Tumblr that kind of

1192
01:51:51.179 --> 01:51:56.719
scarred me for life and now I'm like
scared to open it

1193
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:08.699
sounds like I'm a switch verse bottom
I think

1194
01:52:08.699 --> 01:52:12.739
I think that would make me a

1195
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:20.840
dominant verse
if that is a thing

1196
01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:31.280
I go between top and bottom depending on
the guy I'm talking with

1197
01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:35.100
what was the thing
um

1198
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.000
it was a video
of a seagull

1199
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.800
swallowing a squirrel hole
and uh

1200
01:52:46.679 --> 01:52:50.219
and I can't get it out of my head and I
don't like that it's in my head and now

1201
01:52:50.219 --> 01:52:53.760
I'm scared to go back on Tumblr because
I'm like what are you going to show me

1202
01:52:53.760 --> 01:53:00.500
that is going to break my mind further I
don't need that

1203
01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:06.860
a seagull seagull not a pelican seagull

1204
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.179
and I've hated seagulls my entire life I
grew up on an island seagulls were just

1205
01:53:12.179 --> 01:53:15.719
like hateful and now I'm
like oh I hate you even more because

1206
01:53:15.719 --> 01:53:19.440
where I live now there's a bunch of
squirrels that run around and they're

1207
01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:22.619
just so cute and they run around with
their little nuts and stuff and it's

1208
01:53:22.619 --> 01:53:28.800
like so adorable seeing them like
skitter around and so I'm like

1209
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.639
no these squirrels are my friend they
come up to me and like

1210
01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:36.000
sniff me or whatever squirrels do when
they come near you

1211
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.020
and uh

1212
01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:43.920
and I'm like no no leave the squirrels
alone you hateful hateful devil devil

1213
01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.219
Birds

1214
01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:54.780
why are so many birds complete
right the word the birds that you would

1215
01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:58.199
think would be like crows and
ravens

1216
01:53:58.199 --> 01:54:02.600
are the nice ones they're not

1217
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.300
I got whacked in the face by a seagull
taking off once now I live by the Sea

1218
01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:21.300
and I'm always vigilant my my
horrifyingness of a seagull started with

1219
01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:25.860
my mom was eating a hot dog one day uh
we were sitting in the car and my mom

1220
01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:31.320
was eating a hot dog and the
the seagull flew in the window and got

1221
01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.600
the hot dog in its mouth and like yanked
it out of the bun and I've just been

1222
01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:40.580
horrified of Seagulls ever since

1223
01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.340
oh pigeons are fine
I have no problem with pigeons but

1224
01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:49.739
apparently European pigeons are like
evil but North American pigeons are very

1225
01:54:49.739 --> 01:54:54.119
chill though I do wish that they would
realize that a car can hit them and then

1226
01:54:54.119 --> 01:54:57.600
when a car is coming they should fly
away instead of continuing to just walk

1227
01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:00.719
across the street
they should have you know a better sense

1228
01:55:00.719 --> 01:55:04.219
of self-preservation than they do

1229
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:07.860
because I'm always worried that they're
going to get hit by because I slow down

1230
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:11.300
but I don't know if anyone else does

1231
01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.880
a parrot ate a chicken nugget that's
like

1232
01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:21.540
cannibalism
is a cannibalism when birds eat other

1233
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:26.340
birds
I mean no because like Hawks and stuff

1234
01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:30.719
do that all the time
I actually saw a hawk in a in a parking

1235
01:55:30.719 --> 01:55:35.460
lot the other day it was just sitting on
a car and it looked confused

1236
01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:40.100
I took a picture of it because I was
like what the

1237
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.619
chickens are known to eat eggs
birds are horrifying

1238
01:55:49.619 --> 01:55:52.639
I don't like birds

1239
01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.679
yeah I guess we eat other mammals we we
don't eat people so I guess like if a

1240
01:56:01.679 --> 01:56:04.260
seagull ate a seagull that would be
cannibalism so yeah I guess that makes

1241
01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:06.500
sense

1242
01:56:12.179 --> 01:56:17.340
do yours eat meat I thought deers were
were vegetarian

1243
01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:22.679
vegetarian
herbivores

1244
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.880
horses eat me I grew up with horses I
never saw a horse eat meat

1245
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:49.040
orcas eat orcas will eat anything
and they will just kill anything for fun

1246
01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.219
orcas are
everyone has this idea of orcas as like

1247
01:56:53.219 --> 01:56:56.520
these sweet
you know giant creatures of the sea and

1248
01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:01.440
it's like no they are evil orcas are
evil orcas will kill great whites just

1249
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.460
for fun
great white sharks they leave the great

1250
01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:11.300
white sharks alone they are doing
nothing to nobody leave them alone

1251
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:26.880
I thought Dolphins were the of
the sea well dolphins are a type of orca

1252
01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:29.880
I think
they're very closely related to killer

1253
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.179
whales

1254
01:57:36.659 --> 01:57:40.520
yeah that's it orcas are dolphins

1255
01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:52.199
I blame Free Willy
is there anything out there that eats

1256
01:57:52.199 --> 01:57:57.119
moose
and if the Moose is dead wolves will eat

1257
01:57:57.119 --> 01:58:00.900
it
but if a moose is alive nobody

1258
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:05.780
with a moose
even Bears Don't Go Near moose

1259
01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:17.159
yes orcas do eat moose I've seen that
where a moose is like drinking the water

1260
01:58:17.159 --> 01:58:20.820
and the Orca jumps up and eats it I've
seen that I'm telling you orcas are

1261
01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:27.060
evil they will eat anything and they'll
kill for sport they're nuts

1262
01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.000
everyone's like oh yay Free Willy I'm
like

1263
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.139
I feel bad for the great white who's
just like swimming along having a day

1264
01:58:34.139 --> 01:58:39.780
and like kind of like chilling and then
a pod of great whites or a pot of orcas

1265
01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:43.739
come in and just beat it to death
they don't even eat it it's not food

1266
01:58:43.739 --> 01:58:47.360
they're just like we're gonna beat you
to death

1267
01:58:48.239 --> 01:58:52.619
orcas are the humans of the sea
really though if orcas ever got access

1268
01:58:52.619 --> 01:58:56.360
to guns we'd be

1269
01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:06.659
we had a bear Scare at work once a baby
bear

1270
01:59:06.659 --> 01:59:10.920
wandered into the school grounds and we
had to go into lockdown oh but it's only

1271
01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:14.580
a baby
although Mommy's coming

1272
01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.940
so yeah I understand why the lockdown
happened

1273
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:21.000
depends on the kind of bear too if it's
a black bear then you're probably fine

1274
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.139
black bears are really chill

1275
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:43.619
there's a group of orcas that have been
sinking Yachts I

1276
01:59:43.619 --> 01:59:48.719
I remember that
so yeah maybe maybe they're not entirely

1277
01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:51.020
bad

1278
01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:55.760
imagine if Oppenheimer had been an orca
instead

1279
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.199
well Truman would have been the Orca
Oppenheimer would have been a shark and

1280
02:00:01.199 --> 02:00:04.860
then Truman would have been the Orca
who's like so you made this thing we

1281
02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:09.719
should use it oh I don't think we should
use it oh we should use it

1282
02:00:09.719 --> 02:00:12.719
orkenheimer

1283
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.460
definitely wasn't ready for
revolutionary girl Lieutenant I thought

1284
02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:31.139
it wasn't gonna get crazier than the
trip to India for the explosive Curry

1285
02:00:31.139 --> 02:00:35.760
and out of nowhere the cowbell looks
episode happened

1286
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.320
I still haven't watched it so I'm very
confused now

1287
02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.320
intrigued

1288
02:00:51.239 --> 02:00:56.280
orcas are the largest dolphin it's like
a frog and toad thing all dolphins are

1289
02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:00.199
whales not all whales are dolphins

1290
02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:06.840
the only whale I like are well I like I
beluga whales are cute but I like sperm

1291
02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:11.400
whales
because they're gigantic and like pretty

1292
02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.760
peaceful
until you you know people were stabbing

1293
02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:20.639
them and trying to gut them for their
oil in their head and stuff but like

1294
02:01:20.639 --> 02:01:24.440
sperm whales are like pretty chill

1295
02:01:27.119 --> 02:01:30.360
so we're the Oppenheimer is the face of
the Manhattan Project when he was

1296
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:35.040
thought of whatever's thought of as a
whatever scientist at one point with the

1297
02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.719
others on the project being Legends in
their own right I think it's his I am

1298
02:01:39.719 --> 02:01:44.219
become death the destroyer of worlds
quote that kind of made him the front of

1299
02:01:44.219 --> 02:01:46.860
that
because he was the one that came out

1300
02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:50.900
afterwards saying the bomb was a bad
idea

1301
02:01:52.139 --> 02:01:57.139
so I think that's why he kind of became
the face of the Manhattan Project

1302
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:05.639
when in a whale watch years ago and the
whale came to check us out I was about

1303
02:02:05.639 --> 02:02:09.420
eight feet from an
eye two feet across

1304
02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:15.020
two feet across
God that's like that's lovecraftian

1305
02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:23.719
whales dolphins and porpoises are part
of the animal group known as

1306
02:02:23.719 --> 02:02:28.820
catastia
or quotations

1307
02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:36.239
Orca serial killers
didn't the the crew of the pequod after

1308
02:02:36.239 --> 02:02:40.320
they got sunk by the sperm whale ended
up getting like attacked by

1309
02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.619
orcas later on
I miss remembering that

1310
02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:56.780
Dolphins actually are rapists yes

1311
02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:01.980
the sea creature that freaks me out the
most though is leopard seals

1312
02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:06.300
leopard seals scare the out of me I
would go swimming with a great white

1313
02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:09.179
shark
I would happily go swimming with a great

1314
02:03:09.179 --> 02:03:12.659
white shark with hammerhead sharks
probably not tiger sharks but like a

1315
02:03:12.659 --> 02:03:15.900
great white shark absolutely I would go
swimming with a great great white shark

1316
02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:20.040
because if they're not hungry they're
not coming for you

1317
02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:26.280
um leopard seals though
leopard seals will you up they will

1318
02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.560
they will tear you apart for fun

1319
02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:48.599
sea lions are such adorable sea uncles
I love the videos well the videos of

1320
02:03:48.599 --> 02:03:54.739
like sea lions kind of jumping up onto
boats to escape orcas

1321
02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:02.060
I'm like don't push him back in he's
he's jumping up for a reason

1322
02:04:05.219 --> 02:04:08.340
Happy Feet was the movie that made me
scared of leopard seals I didn't know

1323
02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.940
what leopard seals was were until I saw
Happy Feet and I was like what the

1324
02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.060
are these things and then I like watched
a documentary about them and I was like

1325
02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:20.820
these are serial killers of the North
of the south of the South Pole

1326
02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:25.520
um polar bears are the serial killers of
the North

1327
02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:31.020
how would you know the great how would
you know the white shark isn't hungry uh

1328
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:35.099
you can you can you can tell
if because you can tell when a shark is

1329
02:04:35.099 --> 02:04:38.780
hunting and when it's just gliding

1330
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:44.159
Penguins also jump out of the water to
get away from orcas

1331
02:04:44.159 --> 02:04:49.080
yeah penguins are another bird I don't
mind I like penguins I'd like to like

1332
02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:54.360
pet a penguin
most flightless birds are terrifying but

1333
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:59.280
I like penguins
like ostriches and emus and stuff scared

1334
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.840
the out of me but I like penguins

1335
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.179
James did you hear about the Florida
schools changing the history of slavery

1336
02:05:09.179 --> 02:05:12.239
I'm not shocked about anything that
comes out of Florida anymore

1337
02:05:12.239 --> 02:05:17.639
it used to be the Texas was the most
backward State now Florida has just like

1338
02:05:17.639 --> 02:05:21.440
lapped it ten times over

1339
02:05:22.739 --> 02:05:28.940
there are a lot of gay penguins
penguins are the best Birds

1340
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:38.360
what's your opinion on Caso worries I
don't know what a cassowaries is

1341
02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:45.800
let's look let's look up casawari this
is gonna it's gonna terrify me

1342
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:53.060
oh God no they look evil nope nope nope
it has a Crest on its head it's evil

1343
02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:00.119
birds like that just freak me out I was
attacked by a peacock

1344
02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:04.920
when I was little
it got my cousin kicked dirt at it and

1345
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.340
so it started chasing my cousin but she
got away and so it came after me

1346
02:06:22.619 --> 02:06:28.199
I've seen giant river otters not like in
person but I've seen them like in

1347
02:06:28.199 --> 02:06:30.980
pictures and stuff

1348
02:06:36.239 --> 02:06:40.380
even if a shark is hungry I don't think
it would hunt a human yeah like when

1349
02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.800
sharks attack humans it's because
they're on surfboards

1350
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.360
um sharks don't attack humans when when
the shark can see what the human is

1351
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:52.980
because it's like you have no fat on you
it is not worth the effort that I will

1352
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:58.320
exert to get the to eat you
um so they really don't care about

1353
02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:02.040
humans
um great whites tiger sharks exert much

1354
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:05.820
less energy they are they will attack
humans

1355
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:09.659
um
but great whites won't

1356
02:07:09.659 --> 02:07:14.400
which is why I like great whites I
actually ordered a blanket and it's like

1357
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:19.560
uh it's like a
a blanket that you zip into and it's a

1358
02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:24.599
shark and I can't wait for the fall for
the weather to get cold I'm gonna stream

1359
02:07:24.599 --> 02:07:28.159
in my Shark blanket

1360
02:07:28.619 --> 02:07:33.739
kiwis are cute yeah kiwis are like Derpy
Birds

1361
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.159
the gangster drag queens of birds

1362
02:07:42.599 --> 02:07:47.460
leopard seal versus great white I think
great white winds leopard seal is

1363
02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:52.080
probably faster so it could get away but
the the great the the Great White's

1364
02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:57.260
mouth is just so much bigger
that uh

1365
02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:01.260
it
a leopard shark I don't think would have

1366
02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:07.639
a chance against a great white
unless it swam away

1367
02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:16.080
a quacker parrot I've never I'm not of
I'm Birds freaked me out because things

1368
02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:19.440
that fly kind of freaked me out
um

1369
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:24.599
for some reason crows and ravens and
blue jays corvids don't freak me out

1370
02:08:24.599 --> 02:08:28.380
um pigeons don't freak me out
but I don't think I've been around

1371
02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:32.480
parrots enough to be freaked out by
parrots

1372
02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:40.320
the One Direction to NHL fan pipeline
that is the most rare that is that is

1373
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.760
the most random fan to Fan pipeline I've
heard since yuriana used to killing

1374
02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:48.719
stalking how do you go from a One
Direction fan to an NHL fan how does

1375
02:08:48.719 --> 02:08:51.199
that happen

1376
02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.900
I could not imagine two more different
things

1377
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:07.880
for some reason a lot of Fick writers
are into writing NHL fanfic

1378
02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:14.820
why aren't they writing wrestling fanfic
there's so much

1379
02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:18.679
stuff just ready to be written

1380
02:09:22.619 --> 02:09:26.639
um I've known a lot of hockey players
and I wouldn't say that hockey players

1381
02:09:26.639 --> 02:09:31.980
are necessarily all hot
like go for soccer players or

1382
02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:35.780
rugby players or

1383
02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:43.280
even basketball hockey
players not so much

1384
02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:50.099
when One Direction would go on a break
and broke up NHL fans fanfics went up

1385
02:09:50.099 --> 02:09:53.300
that's so weird

1386
02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:02.099
oh New York mice and rats are not mice
and rats they are they are mutated like

1387
02:10:02.099 --> 02:10:06.020
MMA competitive Fighters

1388
02:10:10.199 --> 02:10:17.460
oh gymnasts
gymnasts and dancers I swear to God

1389
02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:21.659
I have a weakness for specifically
gymnasts like I have a weakness for

1390
02:10:21.659 --> 02:10:24.320
gymnasts

1391
02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.119
a hockey player and a dentist

1392
02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:41.360
it's like a romance between a wrestler
and a pain specialist

1393
02:10:48.239 --> 02:10:51.860
I've actually never watched Ted lasso

1394
02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.520
I think I was like interested in maybe
watching it and then there was like a

1395
02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:00.300
big controversy that he was an Iran fan
or something I can't remember what it

1396
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.420
was that it didn't it didn't make me
like oh I can never watch that it just

1397
02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:08.639
kind of like
killed the moment at the time

1398
02:11:08.639 --> 02:11:12.000
I am super excited for the new Ninja
Turtles movie I'm definitely going to

1399
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.960
see it I love the animation style I love
the personality they've given the

1400
02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:20.599
turtles I I'm super excited for it

1401
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.119
I love that they're actually like
teenagers their voice some of their

1402
02:11:30.119 --> 02:11:34.020
voices I think I think it's Donatello's
voice hasn't cracked is it Donatello I

1403
02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:40.260
think it's Donatello uh his voice hasn't
like completely broken yet it's it looks

1404
02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:44.820
really fun I can't wait to see it
there was actually when I went to see

1405
02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:49.020
Barbie there was a Barbie Ninja Turtles
crossover ad

1406
02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:54.000
that had a lot of people in the audience
like the audience was like 90 women and

1407
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.940
then 10 gay men
um

1408
02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:00.119
so I feel like it wasn't the key
audience for Ninja Turtles but a lot of

1409
02:12:00.119 --> 02:12:06.179
people laughed at it so I think it was
smart smart kind of cross-pollination

1410
02:12:09.119 --> 02:12:14.040
Macaws are large parrots that like to
talk and annoy people my neighbor bred

1411
02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:20.360
them when I was a kid they mocked Us by
getting us to go outside and laugh at us

1412
02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:24.540
dangerous though due to their beaks and
Claws that's what freaks me out about

1413
02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:27.119
birds
you never know when they're gonna just

1414
02:12:27.119 --> 02:12:29.900
take your eye out

1415
02:12:33.719 --> 02:12:37.159
what time is it

1416
02:12:45.599 --> 02:12:52.579
he had to wear leather clothing
do you have to wear leather clothing

1417
02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:58.619
owls are like really cool looking until
they're like wet and you see what they

1418
02:12:58.619 --> 02:13:01.380
actually look like under the feathers
then they're horrifying then it's like

1419
02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:06.119
ah I get where the the art of like demon
Kings and stuff like that from the

1420
02:13:06.119 --> 02:13:10.699
Middle Ages came from somebody saw a wet
owl

1421
02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:22.320
I'm having the best birthday week next
week's TMNT comes out on my birthday and

1422
02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.920
Heart Stopper comes out the day after oh
that's uh for some reason I didn't

1423
02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:29.540
realize TMNT came out next week

1424
02:13:29.639 --> 02:13:33.360
because I definitely want to see that
definitely going to be watching Heart

1425
02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:38.099
Stopper then I think uh is it the week
after Hearthstone or maybe it's the end

1426
02:13:38.099 --> 02:13:43.940
of August when uh red white and royal
blue comes out I can't remember

1427
02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.719
yeah there's a new Ninja Turtles movie
that's coming out that the animation

1428
02:13:51.719 --> 02:13:55.500
style is kind of closer to
um

1429
02:13:55.500 --> 02:14:00.900
Puss in Boots The Last Wish
and it looks really good uh Jason you

1440
02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:06.659

other stuff I have to make videos

1441

I have to make videos and then I'm doing

1442
02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:17.119
a talk at Ottawa Pride uh it's the first
time I'm going to be doing a live talk

1443
02:15:17.119 --> 02:15:22.980
so I'm going to have it recorded
um so it can go up for patrons

1444
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:27.860
um
and so that's exciting and terrifying

1445
02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:32.659
mostly terrifying because I don't know
what we're going to talk about yet

1446
02:15:38.099 --> 02:15:43.699
I still don't know if I read the red
white and royal blue book before

1447
02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:50.360
if you like want to read it before or
after the movie

1448
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:56.940
thank you ka it's been a long time since

gave a live talk uh and it's actually

1451

it's going to be basically a a talk
between me and Nick kind of like a live

1452
02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:12.780
podcast

1453

1456
02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:44.639
something interesting
happened to me I've had to walk with a

1457
02:16:44.639 --> 02:16:48.599
cane for the last three weeks
I feel like less like an old man and

1458
02:16:48.599 --> 02:16:52.639
more like a stately gentleman oh

1459
02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:00.000
will they let you stream or post it to
your channel

1460
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.460
