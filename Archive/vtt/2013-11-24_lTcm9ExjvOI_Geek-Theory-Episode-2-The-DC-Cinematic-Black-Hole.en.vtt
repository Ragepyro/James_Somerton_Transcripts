00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.630
Warner Brothers and DC comics are
absolutely obsessed with creating their

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
own cinematic universe much like Marvel
has done over the past few years Man of

3
00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
Steel the recent Superman movie was
their first attempt at creating such an

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.080
interconnected universe we all know that
the next Superman movie will feature

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
Batman in what capacity though we're not
quite sure will it be a team up will

6
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.900
they be fighting against each other or
will Batman be absent altogether with

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
only Bruce Wayne playing into the story
that last option is the one I'm hoping

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.930
for and it's also the least likely to
happen so I'm not getting my hopes up

9
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.989
but why are they so determined with
Superman and Batman into a single movie

10
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.710
especially since Man of Steel was the
first really successful Superman movie

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.500
in decades even though it performed well
below Warner Brothers expectations well

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
that's the reason right there Batman is
a license to print money for Warner

13
00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.289
Brothers Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight
trilogy grossed almost 2.3 billion

14
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.780
dollars worldwide Man of Steel has taken
in 662 million worldwide which is

15
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.799
definitely respectable but nowhere near
the numbers for the dark knight or the

16
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.110
dark knight rises so you take that man
who can bring in a fortune and Superman

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
who does pretty well at the box office
on his own and throw them together and

18
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
voila there you have the beginning of
the DC Cinematic Universe but the

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
problem is that Batman is really the
only DC character that has consistently

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.240
done well at the box office Superman has
been hit-or-miss at best Green Lantern

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.560
was an absolute disaster to say the
least and they haven't really had the

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.920
guts to put anyone else on the silver
screen no matter how many times people

23
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.540
cry for a Wonder Woman movie so Warner
Brothers in DC are basically betting the

24
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.270
farm that a Superman and Batman team-up
will bring in billions of dollars and to

25
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
be perfectly honest they're probably
right but it's going to take a lot of

26
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.500
work to create a cinematic universe that
can realistically feature characters

27
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.340
like Batman Superman the Green Lantern
Wonder Woman in the flash let alone

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.459
Aquaman movies are not comic books and
sometimes the suspension of disbelief is

29
00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.860
a little harder to come by I know that
DC wants a sin

30
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.480
matic universe that can compete with
Marvel but I think they may be going

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.310
about it in the wrong way Batman is the
only DC character with a proven track

32
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.440
record in feature films so why not milk
that property I'm not saying that they

33
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.180
should just blindly make more Batman
movies because I along with a lot of

34
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.040
other people feel that Batman is a
little overexposed but there are plenty

35
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.450
of characters within the Batman universe
that are right for cinematic betrayals

36
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.160
they could create a cinematic universe
based entirely around Batman characters

37
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.590
such as Robin Batgirl Nightwing Batwoman
even Commissioner Gordon they could even

38
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.640
have the story follow on directly from
the Dark Knight trilogy Batman is gone

39
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.260
yes but crime still exists so other
people have to take up the mantle of

40
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.930
crime fighter in Gotham City and the
surrounding areas so the characters

41
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
could easily interact with each other DC
and Warner could beat marvel to the

42
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.239
punch by having that woman be the first
major LGBT superhero to hit the big

43
00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.870
screen and they could have different
tones depending upon which characters

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.450
are in each movie such as lighter tones
for Batgirl and Robin appealing to a

45
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.080
younger demographic making it safe for
you to bring the small kids to movies

46
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.330
again and have darker tones for
Commissioner Gordon batwoman Nightwing

47
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.180
more in line with man of steel and the
dark knight series and if the person

48
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.170
playing Robin wants to leave the series
no problem there have been so many

49
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.650
different characters betraying the Boy
Wonder in the comics that an actor

50
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.820
change would be very little and could
quickly be explained away and you

51
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.370
wouldn't have to spend a whole lot of
time in each movie introducing new

52
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.750
villains because Batman's most
well-known villains frequently spill

53
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.700
over into these other characters stories
there is so much potential here but it's

54
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.840
like it hasn't even been considered by
the people at Warner Brothers had they

55
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.030
done this instead of Batman vs Superman
they might have even avoided the whole

56
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.519
Ben Affleck backlash and we would all be
better off so what do you guys think do

57
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.760
you think the Batman Cinematic Universe
is a more realistic goal for Warner in

58
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.120
DC or do you think they can actually
pull off a Justice League movie within

59
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.620
the next couple of years let me know in
