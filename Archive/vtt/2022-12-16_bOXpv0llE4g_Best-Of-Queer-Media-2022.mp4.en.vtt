00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
hey everyone 2022 was
really a year but one thing that I was

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
shocked by was how much amazing media
with queer themes and characters

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.219
actually came out this year so I decided
to do a top eight queer movies or TV

4
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
shows of the year and I'm actually going
to be joined today by Nick the co-writer

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
on all of my videos and since he's
joining in today I wanted to announce

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
that his novel gentlemen's club a really
fun story about a teenage queer

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
superhero is going on sale for the whole

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.520
queer superhero Thriller every reader
needs and that I personally think is one

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420

years and the paperback is also

the queer nerd in your life Link in the

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.579
description but before we get started
don't forget to like And subscribe and

13
00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.079
share this video everywhere since
YouTube hates to let my own subscribers

14
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.300
know that new videos are out so without
any further Ado let's take a look at the

15
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.860
best queer media of 2022 in no
particular order

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.479
in our own opinion
Sandman Neil gaiman's acclaimed graphic

17
00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.320
novel series finally reached the small
screen with a smash realistically while

18
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
the comic is popular and highly regarded
I prefer this story as a streaming

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
series rather than I would have as a
film while the sprawling visuals and

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.960
Beauty atmosphere are cinematic its
cerebral elements would have had to get

21
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.979
cut to accommodate a feature length
television especially streaming simply

22
00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.840
offers a wider range of what could be
explored including an open exploration

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.340
of queerness make no mistake Sandman
from its conception is a story about the

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.659
very exploration of Dreams what dreams
mean to people and the ways that dreams

25
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.220
reflect on our reality and especially in
this first Arc what a world without

26
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
dreams is want to become gaming creates
mythology ever so tangential to DC's

27
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.799
principal cast of characters centered
around personifications of The Human

28
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.119
Experience a family of siblings called
the endless all of whom are named after

29
00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.280
an abstract concept starting with the
letter D Destiny dream desire death

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
Despair and because gaming focuses on
personal battles in lieu of third act

31
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.120
cookie cutter monster fights or beams of
light shooting into the sky Studio heads

32
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.300
especially given the state of Warner
Brothers these days doesn't have any

33
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.920
reason to understand why it would be a
hit outside of course gaiman's dedicated

34
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.080
yet Niche fanbase though really the
largest red flag to the rotating door of

35
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
middle-aged straight men who spend a
fortune renovating Executive offices for

36
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.400
their brief sojourn at the Warner
Brothers headquarters it would be

37
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.959
gaiman's weird insistence of putting so
many damn queer people into his [ __ ]

38
00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.000
even gaiman's original 1988 run of
Sandman was pretty gay for the streaming

39
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.260
adaptation he seemed to be adamant that
it would be even care in conjunction

40
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.980
with adding more color to the original
cast of characters in a world which

41
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.140
consistently accuses creators of forcing
diversity and wokeness Gaiman can safely

42
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.220
say he was doing it before it was cool
given that the endless were developed to

43
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.480
function as Superior even to Gods
especially as they are depicted in other

44
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.519
titles dreams peerage are they
themselves beings of cosmic significance

45
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.140
so great that societal Hang-Ups around
sex and gender would be irrelevant the

46
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.340
often antagonistic character of desire
for instance is depicted as either

47
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.280
neither and or both genders desire as it
would apply to everyone would befit any

48
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.120
range of attractions desire doesn't need
to have a gender it only needs to be

49
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.099
tantalizing what helps Sandman stand out
most of all however is gaiman's Comfort

50
00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.299
depicting queer characters who are
either villainous despicable or simply

51
00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.680
flawed make no mistake they are depicted
alongside and sometimes even interact

52
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.720
with queer characters who are vulnerable
however with corporate lens queerness

53
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.459
notes from Executives often outline that
lgbtq plus characters must be glowing

54
00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.720
beacons of morality Paragons of goodness
or tragic figures which

55
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.060
while annoying is a very justifiable and
preferable reaction to generations of

56
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.560
queer-coded or even explicitly queer
villains but that shouldn't mean that we

57
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.819
snap in the opposite direction queer
people can be [ __ ] and we can be

58
00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.620
competent and a ruthlessness and Sandman
is comfortable depicting us as this as

59
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.300
well as compassionate and kind
inherently heroic albeit flawed deeply

60
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.560
flawed albeit kind granted it certainly
helps when you have Alan heinberg on

61
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.460
board all do credit of course to Neil
Gaiman but he's never turned down an

62
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.520
opportunity to collaborate with
like-minded creatives with credits such

63
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.060
as Sex In The City the Young Avengers
and the good

64
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.020
Wonder Woman movie he's one of the most
identifiable queer creators in

65
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.340
mainstream media today Gaiman himself is
an award-winning writer for the small

66
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.880
and big screen though he did want to
expand the range Awareness on Sandman

67
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.080
and it means a lot to include queer
voices in their own representation Heart

68
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.220
Stopper heartstopper tells the story of
the absolutely Charming coming-of-age

69
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.060
romance between two boys Nick and
Charlie based on the graphic novels of

70
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.660
the same name by Alice oseman
heartstoppers seemingly came out of

71
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.800
nowhere when it was released this past
summer acting as counter programming to

72
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.300
the typical Doom and Gloom of most queer
focused stories in mainstream media this

73
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.740
wasn't about gay bashing or death it was
just about two boys falling for each

74
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.820
other and one of them coming to terms
with his own bisexuality the show also

75
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.419
featured a wonderfully diverse
Supporting Cast with lesbian couple Tara

76
00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.440
and Darcy actually having their own
engaging storyline throughout the show

77
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.300
and trans character L actually getting
to be a trans character whose storyline

78
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.259
doesn't revolve around trauma
transphobia or hate her story is about

79
00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.660
learning that people will like her and
even love her for exactly who she is the

80
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.580
Netflix show received almost Universal
Acclaim from critics with many praising

81
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.419
it for being the rare queer-centric show
to depict a more innocent side of being

82
00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.259
a queer teenager and actually being
pretty safe for parents to watch with

83
00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.560
their kids without having sex pushed to
the Forefront though some people did

84
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.300
take issue with what they called a
sanitized look at queerness most viewers

85
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.620
embrace the show since premiering it's
been renewed for two additional Seasons

86
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.800
which will likely wrap up the story
that's being told in the graphic novels

87
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.120
and season 2 has already completed
shooting but the show hasn't been

88
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.020
without its controversies after the
cancellation of another Netflix show

89
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.979
with two queer lead characters first
kill the streaming service was accused

90
00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:32.280
of choosing a gay-centric show over a
lesbian-centric show since at a glance

91
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.660
first kill had higher viewership numbers
than heartstopper the cancellation grew

92
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.560
out of more nuanced information that
most streamers don't usually make public

93
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.639
though in this case that would be the
completion rate of the series meaning

94
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.360
how many people watched the first
episode and then finished watching every

95
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.819
episode in the season within the first
30 days lots of caveats there viewership

96
00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.780
for first kill dropped off drastically
about halfway through the season while

97
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.500
it stayed solid for Heart Stopper which
was also a much cheaper show to produce

98
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.240
but luckily though first kill was
canceled there is a lesbian couple in

99
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.900
heartstopper and some great Sapphic
horror representation in other Netflix

100
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.860
properties like the Fear Street Trilogy
and even stranger things and of course

101
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.940
I'd be remiss not to mention the toxic
fandom that grew up around the show that

102
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.620
demanded kit Connor the actor playing
Nick on the show reveal his sexuality to

103
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.240
the world at the age of 18. there's a 45
minute long video on my Channel with me

104
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.780
talking about that so I won't go into
too much detail about it here but

105
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.300
suffice to say it sucked
don't do that to people Heart Stopper

106
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.220
managed to be a ray of queer sunshine in
a year otherwise filled with hateful

107
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.539
politicians and bigoted internet trolls
and while many people my age and older

108
00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:49.139
felt like they couldn't watch it because
it would just remind them of the teenage

109
00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:54.840
years that they never had it did act as
a spot of Hope for queer youth desperate

110
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.680
for some good news this year and the
good news keeps coming with Yasmin

111
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.740
Finney the actress who played Elle on
the show joining the cast of the new

112
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.620
Doctor Who and Joe Locke Charlie joining
the ever expanding MCU with a yet

113
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.720
unspecified role in The One Division
follow-up Agatha coven of chaos and with

114
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.020
season two of Heart Stopper coming to
Netflix this summer we won't be wanting

115
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.780
for non-depressing queer content for a
while

116
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.160
it's about time
everything everywhere all at once

117
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.539
probably the greatest theater going
experience I've had in a long time

118
00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:32.159
everything everywhere is such a unique
cinematic experience that it continues

119
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.839
to put to shame every iteration of this
new wave of Multiverse movies this movie

120
00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:41.520
of course hinges on the trans-pacific
PowerHouse Michelle yo to offer some

121
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.020
emotional realness to a film that
supports reality itself Evelyn Quan Wang

122
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.860
is an overworked overstressed and
overwhelmed mother wife daughter and

123
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.519
small business owner under a barrage of
tax audits for her strange spending

124
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:58.080
habits her unquiet mind fills with
regret for each decision that she has

125
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.580
made leading her to this point she does
not see her life but sees a hundred

126
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.040
other lives she could have lived if only
she had made different choices she is so

127
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.580
disillusioned with her own life that she
struggles to connect with anyone in it

128
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.200
her lesbian daughter longs to be taken
seriously into no longer have to live up

129
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.399
to her mother's expectations Evelyn's
husband has grown so distant that he

130
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:24.360
wants to consider divorce and
netherland's business is in shambles

131
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.339
unlike the range of flashpoints and
Multiverse of madnesses roaming the

132
00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:33.360
hulls of California studios everything
everywhere was not meant to merely be a

133
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.019
Multiverse movie but meant to be a
representation of what it feels to not

134
00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:40.940
only watch your life pass you by but all
the other lives that you could be living

135
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.019
something that struck a chord in this
late stage covered world with so many

136
00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:50.220
people wondering what the heck am I
doing with my life how can you value

137
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.240
your own life when you don't even know
whether this is the life you should or

138
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.560
want to live in how do you keep track of
all these fantasies and decisions you

139
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.399
didn't make and what can you do to enjoy
the opportunities that you have in this

140
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:05.700
life when you do nothing but wonder
about the opportunities you did not take

141
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.899
and yes the movie is quite queer with
Evelyn's daughter Joy being the force

142
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:13.740
that is going to consume the Multiverse
the rift between joy and her mother

143
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.180
grows so large that Joyce spirals into
self-destruction figuratively and or

144
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.160
literally Evelyn at first is comfortable
with Joy's queerness in fact at one

145
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.120
point she expresses her belief that
someone convinced joy to be a lesbian

146
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.019
though later in the film Evelyn is
exposed to other versions of herself who

147
00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:35.580
are lesbians and sees other iterations
of herself who are different variations

148
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.940
of queer how can you be uncomfortable
with someone else's queerness when you

149
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.800
realize that in another world you could
have been also queer how can you hate

150
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.480
anyone for anything they are when the
world affords you an infinite range of

151
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.519
opportunities and experiences why should
you disapprove of anyone when you are

152
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:57.000
who you are because of a collection of
circumstances and choices culminating in

153
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.060
your very personhood everything
everywhere stands out among Multiverse

154
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.800
movies for this reason using multiple
realities to ask and provide guidance on

155
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.060
these big questions but also because it
actually let itself go into the Absurd

156
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.899
when every other movie just uses
alternate realities as an excuse to

157
00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:17.760
break out the all green screen and
underpace some digital effects artists

158
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.800
everything ever at once invites you to
Revel in the absurdity of reality and

159
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.959
maybe that a little bit of absurdity is
good for an overworked overwhelmed soul

160
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:32.220
Interview with the Vampire Interview
with the Vampire based on the novel of

161
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.360
the same name by the iconic novelist
Anne Rice who passed away this past year

162
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.760
just a few days before my own mom was
phenomenal the vampire Chronicles on

163
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.959
which interview is based are notoriously
queer in and of themselves with a cast

164
00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:49.200
of almost exclusively bisexual
characters with a few gender

165
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.800
non-conforming characters thrown in as
well such as lestat's mother Gabrielle

166
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.640
the pre-production of this show was
scrutinized and criticized from the jump

167
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.360
even from me fans were very worried
about the show changing the race of two

168
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.140
of the main characters Louis and Claudia
and changing the time period of the

169
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.480
story from the Antebellum South to the
early 20th century but in my opinion

170
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.860
they pulled it off and then some by
changing Louis from the owner of a

171
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.720
plantation to the owner of multiple
brothels he's still using people to make

172
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.680
his money and Jacob Anderson best known
for his role of gray worm in Game of

173
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.079
Thrones absolutely knocks it out of the
park playing Louie Louie is kind of a

174
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:32.880
whiny [ __ ] in the books sorry Louis
stands but he's so much more complex and

175
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.079
engaging in the show and Bailey bass is
Claudia an aged up version compared to

176
00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:40.620
the five-year-old in the book and the 10
year old in the movie is a 14 year old

177
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.779
force of absolute Terror and Charisma
making a star at a Bailey bass almost as

178
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:49.440
soon as she enters the cast but
post-release the most controversy grew

179
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.060
out of two aspects of the show one just
how gay it was somehow people had

180
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.779
managed to read the vampire Chronicles
and not pick up on all of the vampires

181
00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:01.320
being Queer as hell and they were very
angry that there were men kissing each

182
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.040
other on their TV screens but actual
fans were looking forward to the

183
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.700
queerness and were certainly not
disappointed but the second controversy

184
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.720
actually grew out of the the existing
fan base for the books that being that

185
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.920
the absolute toxic abusive and downright
evil depiction of the series star Lestat

186
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.660
de Leon Cole played here to gaslighting
Perfection by Sam Reed while Lestat was

187
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.779
certainly emotionally abusive and
manipulative in the original book as

188
00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:28.320
well as the film adaptation he never
reached the level of violent toxicity

189
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.339
that he did in the show beating Louis to
within an inch of his vampiric life on

190
00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:36.120
one occasion personally I think this is
brilliant because it's playing with the

191
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.899
unreliable narrator Trope that we know
was employed retroactively to Louis

192
00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:44.040
Story Once Lestat became the main POV
character for the book series in the

193
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.820
books it's well known that Louis made
Lestat out to be a much worse person

194
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.480
than he actually was which is what I
think is happening here especially with

195
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.980
the very powerful influence of a very
powerful vampire no spoilers who happens

196
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.040
to hate lestock because of an
interaction they had a few hundred years

197
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.060
ago it makes perfect sense for Louis to
describe Lestat as being the Devil

198
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.680
Himself and it will be deliciously juicy
when Lestat gets to tell his side of the

199
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.700
story the series currently has a 99 nine
percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and

200
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.420
was listed as one of the best new shows
of the Year by multiple media Outlets

201
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.779
after the release while the ratings were
soft for its traditional television

202
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:23.880
release with about a million viewers per
episode its digital releases on AMC plus

203
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.540
each episode coming out one week before
they aired on traditional cable

204
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.519
represented the top rated launch for a
new series ever on the service so we'll

205
00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:36.740
be seeing a lot more of Anne Rice's
creatures of the night in years to come

206
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.860
what we do in the shadows vampires are
gay it's just a thing sorry no it's not

207
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.519
woke garbage it's always been a thing to
the point of Street vampires being

208
00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:52.019
errantly homophobic there I said it sexy
monsters for straight people is Peak

209
00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:57.480
queer appropriation when we had nothing
we invented the sexy monster when all of

210
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.959
Street Media was about Gallant Heroes
rescuing the princess from the monster

211
00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:05.279
gay people who had been decried as
society's monsters turned around and

212
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.820
said well if this is monster [ __ ]
it's actually kind of hot not just gay

213
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.019
people but any kind of unashamed sexual
deviance including asexuals really

214
00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:17.339
because Society was so anal retentive
about purity that when you did have sex

215
00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:21.600
they were gonna be weird about whether
you enjoyed it or not hegemony is so

216
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:28.320
weird which is why when you get a horny
vampire Convent they end up feeling just

217
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.240
like family this layer of Staten Island
vampires was already very established to

218
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.779
be sexually fluid in their first three
seasons specifically through the

219
00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:41.279
character of Laszlo cravensworth who was
proudly omnisexual from the very first

220
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.360
up episode yet in spite of Disney's
acquisition of fox and their IPs the

221
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.560
show winners and improv heavy cast
decided to couldn't double down on just

222
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.920
how gay it was going to get for this
fourth season and not only were there

223
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.300
more explicit discussions of queerness
and very explicit often coming from that

224
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.079
very signature line delivery and
nandor's confusion over why he needs to

225
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:04.980
explain that he had boy wives but the
season itself has commentary about

226
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.639
queerness Believe It or Not mark my
words what we do in the shadows will be

227
00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:13.260
discovered as an Untold Brilliance of
social commentary one day using the idea

228
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.220
of immortal vampires to criticize our
societal misconceptions about history

229
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.779
our contemporary Society but also
demonstrating what kind of people we

230
00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:25.620
become when we don't have to really be
worried about eating or dying consider

231
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.839
just how much of our existence revolves
around being alive and how much anxiety

232
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:34.860
do you experience from knowing that
you're not going to be young forever all

233
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.220
those times you say well maybe next year
and how many hobbies and interests

234
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.300
you're putting off just because you need
to pay for food and shelter what if you

235
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.740
didn't have to worry about either of
those things what if you could just do

236
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.660
all the things you wanted to do with no
social expectations no timeline no need

237
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.699
for resources what reason would you have
to make a bucket list in the first place

238
00:16:56.699 --> 00:17:00.959
just do the thing and these vampires
kind of looked down on people who have

239
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:05.220
these Hang-Ups they're doing fine
outside the confines arms and they don't

240
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.939
understand why people are so married to
them in a brilliant moment of meta

241
00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:14.280
commentary about queer characters coming
out in media Guillermo a human and

242
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.959
former slave slash servant comes out to
his family trying to get an emotional

243
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:23.339
moment to celebrate the courage he had
to muster to do this the Empire Queen

244
00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:28.140
Naja doesn't feel inclined to give him
the credit I mean who isn't gay a lot of

245
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:34.020
people oh okay I'll get the trumpets out
sorry queerness and the often absurd

246
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.340
pursuit of personal desires are her
world she doesn't feel that coming out

247
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.059
needs to be celebrated because she
doesn't understand why anyone in this

248
00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:46.320
environment would ever need to be in the
closet in the first place she and her

249
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.700
vampire Bros are so detached from social
expectations she understands that

250
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.980
sexuality gender fashion and etiquette
really have no impact on who a person

251
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.660
really is coming out is unremarkable
because any kind of social hangup is a

252
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.260
matter of preference and therefore
unremarkable which can be a good good

253
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.580
thing and can also be a bad thing after
centuries of disconnecting from the

254
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.799
world you kind of lose your ability to
exist in it so maybe some tethers of

255
00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:17.700
polite Society are necessary in this
strange little television show about

256
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.720
vampires who are completely separated
from reality there's this running

257
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.160
commentary about privilege the real
privilege isn't wealth but what wealth

258
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.900
or immortality can afford the ability to
do the things that you want and not

259
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.660
worry about the things that you need
Chucky

260
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.840
Chucky is one of my favorite shows of
all time it's at once scary campy funny

261
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.679
and touching season one which came out
last year introduced us to Jake and

262
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:47.880
Devin a gay teenage horror power couple
fighting to survive against the titular

263
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.320
serial killing doll the first season
ended with a giant bloodbath leaving our

264
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.640
pair of final boys in the Foster system
but after Chucky comes back into their

265
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.419
lives and blows everything up
literally they along with their friend

266
00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:04.799
Lexi are sent to a reform school run by
the Catholic Church where we get

267
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:09.059
fabulous callbacks to horror icons like
the Exorcist and The Omen throughout as

268
00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:12.660
well as some original religious horror
iconography since Chucky likes to kill

269
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.860
in style Jake and Devin's relationship
is strained though when one of a

270
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.000
seemingly endless parade of Chucky dolls
convinces Jake that he's actually good

271
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.140
after A Clockwork Orange style
deprogramming adding emotional tension

272
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.039
to a story already piling up with dead
bodies and elsewhere in the show we get

273
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:33.120
to see Camp Queen Jennifer Tilly give
the performance of a lifetime as Tiffany

274
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.679
Valentine Chucky's serial killing ex who
once inhabited the body of a doll but

275
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:41.820
now inhabits the body of oscar-nominated
actress Jennifer Tilly we even get a

276
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.299
standalone episode with Tilly at the
center of a bloody dinner party murder

277
00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:49.500
mystery clue style and elsewhere in the
show we get Glenn and Glenda the

278
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.340
non-binary children of Chucky and
Tiffany who were once one split

279
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.600
personality inhabiting a doll but are
now two people both played by non-binary

280
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.080
actor Lachlan Watson best known for
playing Theo on the chilling Adventures

281
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.400
of Sabrina their dynamic as basically
the good twin and the evil twin plays

282
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.580
out throughout the season sometimes
wanting to kill their dad sometimes

283
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.799
trying to kill their mom but always
being there for each other an absolutely

284
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:18.179
Bonkers Christmas episode closes out the
season with more blood thrown around on

285
00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:22.620
screen since a bad night at the house of
blue leaves the second season of the

286
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.419
show managed to introduce multiple new
characters that I really cared about and

287
00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:31.559
further developed Jake and Devin's
relationship past just a cute teenage

288
00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:35.880
crush and into this kind of love that
can only happen once you've been through

289
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.679
a war together Don Mancini who's been
the Evil Genius behind Chucky from the

290
00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:45.600
very beginning except that horrible 2019
remake which I will never forgive brings

291
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.160
so much campy fun and real heart to this
slasher TV series that it's one of the

292
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.840
very few shows I'm willing to watch week
to week I usually only binge watch shows

293
00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.179
once they're finished now but Chucky had
me rushing to my TV ever every week to

294
00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:04.980
follow the over-the-top Adventures of
Jake and Devin Glenn and Glenda Tiffany

295
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.919
and Chucky Lexi and Nadine and Nina a
paraplegic woman possessed by Chucky and

296
00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:15.960
held captive by Tiffany who's kind of in
love with her she's played by Fiona Dora

297
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.640
the daughter of Chucky's voice actor
Brad Dourif and she Nails it she even

298
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.580
plays a young version of her father in
flashbacks and it's uncanny this show is

299
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.380
so weird between killer dolls crazy
psychiatrists further developing

300
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.940
characters set up all the way back in
1988 and Devin saw while playing no less

301
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.280
than three different characters it might
be one of the oddest shows on cable

302
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.080
and I love every minute of it it's like
Heart Stopper for slasher fans

303
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.539
in other words
the perfect show for me our flag means

304
00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:57.360
death nobody really expected this quirky
to come about Pirates to be as gay as it

305
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.100
was I mean for us in the know we know
that pirates were pretty gay and the

306
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.240
fact that taekwatiti was attached to the
series both as a contributor and co-lead

307
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.720
this definitely signaled that it would
at least appeal to our queer

308
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.100
sensibilities but it was surprising to
us pleasantly that there was first such

309
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.559
a stark depiction of non-binary identity
and then an actual gay romance subplot

310
00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:24.120
between two secondary characters however
and maybe this is because we're just so

311
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.380
used to being baited even that didn't
prepare us for the decoding of the

312
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.980
romance between Steve Bonnet and
Blackbeard as a matter of fact the

313
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.600
iconic kiss between these incarcerated
Pirates was improvised by taikwa TV reez

314
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.740
Darby was of course in on the subtlety
the script even without the kiss was

315
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.000
designed to bring them into romantic
territory probably smartly the actors

316
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.020
realized that garnishing a true fan base
for the show especially among its queer

317
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.220
viewers would require more than crumbs
even if the provided crumbs had been

318
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.940
substantial the show takes a
defamiliarized approach first of all to

319
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.500
depicting piracy that said our modern
conceptions about piracy are often

320
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.500
flawed hardly the bloodthirsty yet loyal
crew of visually smelly men that you may

321
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.039
be familiar with from the Pirates films
when in fact piracy was born out of an

322
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:15.179
ideological resistance to British and or
Spanish colonial rule and though the

323
00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:19.500
framing of the show is absurd the fact
of the matter is that this is indeed

324
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.120
based on real people and real events and
probably broaching a lot closer to

325
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.440
reality than you may realize just don't
Wikipedia these people and learn what

326
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.520
actually happened to them in real life
our flag means death however is a

327
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.720
significant stride forward in queer
media in general hardly about queerness

328
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.400
in any specific way nobody really needs
to justify their sexuality or gender in

329
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.600
spite of having discussions about it
this is a good story which is told about

330
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:51.840
queer people who don't like queer people
won't tune in but people who just want a

331
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.080
good story will keep watching and feed
them to the demand for the upcoming

332
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.520
second season hopefully the outrageous
success of this series will shed a light

333
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.100
on how queer stories can be told to
Executives and other creators alike

334
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.280
American Horror Story
okay spoilers for this one American

335
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.260
Horror Story has been
hit and miss for most of its run while

336
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.960
some Seasons like Asylum are Rock Solid
from start to finish some waiver halfway

337
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.520
through like the admittedly iconic coven
and others fall flat on their face like

338
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.299
double feature I was beginning to wonder
how many ghosts witches serial killers

339
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:30.980
aliens vampires and even the Devil
Himself the show could keep churning out

340
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:36.419
so in the latest season simply subtitled
New York City started being advertised

341
00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:41.700
with the most vague commercials of any
season yet which is saying something I

342
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.659
didn't know what to expect and then the
show started airing and we were

343
00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:51.360
introduced to two forces of evil killing
gay men in 1980s New York a serial

344
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.659
killer and a seemingly Supernatural sex
Spirit the usual craziness in Camp of

345
00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:01.380
other Seasons didn't materialize this
time around with the real focus on the

346
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.820
show being the way gay men are ignored
by society and how they gauge their own

347
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.500
worth based on attractiveness and sex
appeal and not much else I was intrigued

348
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.240
by the mystery and motives surrounding
the main serial killer and confused by

349
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.080
the inclusion of the supernatural
elements that seemed all sorts of out of

350
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.679
place it felt like no other season of
the show before it focusing heavily on

351
00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:27.120
realistic characters with an almost
entirely queer cast playing an almost

352
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.400
entirely queer cast of characters I kept
waiting for sex demons from the sewer to

353
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.480
pop up or something when the main serial
killer is taken out with three episodes

354
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.740
left to go in the season
I was worried we'd have another season

355
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.640
on our hands where everything just falls
apart in the Final Act but then it

356
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.380
didn't because the characters who had
been showing odd but not that troubling

357
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.940
ailments throughout the season seeing
the sex Spirit

358
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:58.500
even being assaulted by him are finally
confronted with the truth

359
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.760
the Real Horror
AIDS had arrived in New York City and

360
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.360
the faceless demon we've been confused
by all season is actually an allegorical

361
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.440
stand-in for the then unknown virus
secretly ravaging the gay community

362
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.760
without being acknowledged without the
Flash and Pizzazz of a serial killer it

363
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.340
was ignored and even ignored by we the
audience of the show it was just a weird

364
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.480
thing on the periphery until it wasn't
until there was no ignoring the Grim

365
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.440
Reaper hovering around our cast of
characters in the final two-part episode

366
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.659
of the Season almost everyone in our
cast dies all but one gay character and

367
00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:37.500
we're shown the horrifying results of
AIDS infections before the days of

368
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.600
protease Inhibitors we see the slow
painful death of our caste far worse

369
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.320
than the relatively quick deaths brought
on by a serial killer we even see

370
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.760
several straight female characters one
had been married to a gay character

371
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.840
before he came out and another for whom
a gay character had been a sperm donor

372
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.799
and they fall victim to the disease as
well showing the audience that no one

373
00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:03.419
was safe from this vicious virus that
the leather-clad Grim Reaper doesn't

374
00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:07.500
care if you're gay or straight in a
surprisingly powerful and Abstract

375
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.820
moment we see the countless gay men
piling into an open grave one after

376
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:17.279
another this Force takes them away never
to be seen again but within memories

377
00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:21.659
American Horror Story New York City the
11th season of this long-running horror

378
00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:25.140
Anthology was not at all what I was
expecting

379
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.220
and for the first time in the series
left me feeling actually horrified by

380
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.419
the abstract realism in the final
moments of the show it might just be the

381
00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:37.559
final season of the show
and what a way to go out

382
00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:41.700
forcing the audience to witness a killer
that felt very Supernatural in the early

383
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.620
days of the epidemic cold heartless
without motive and with authorities

384
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.039
unable or unwilling
to stop it

385
00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:54.720
so as I said this year had a surprising
amount of really good and sometimes

386
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.620
great queer content and we didn't even
talk about shows like A League of Their

387
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.279
Own which I haven't gotten a chance to
watch yet or foreign series like young

388
00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:06.600
Royals and semantic error or the
animated shows like the return of the

389
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.860
owl house or the ongoing Brilliance of
dead end paranormal park or the overtly

390
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.400
queer and delightfully offensive hell of
a boss

391
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:20.000
but don't worry
the holidays are coming

392
00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:23.900
and we're getting ready to go to hell
