00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.030
Whenever I think I’ve dropped the mic on
Disney, something like the summer of 2021

2
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.030
happens.

3
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.079
Where do we start?

4
00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.070
With the gay fishboys who are definately not
gay?

5
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.780
The bisexual Loki who avoids all same-gender
companionship like the plague?

6
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.600
Or the genderfluid Loki who is only ever referred
to as a man?

7
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.039
Raya, and her life-long frenemie, though they
might have come a little bit earlier in the

8
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.039
summer, in late spring, they were both swathed
in a consistent lesbian mood?

9
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.640
The close.

10
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.940
Friendship.

11
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.300
Between Sam and Bucky?

12
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.560
Or just… this shot of Prada Bucky alone?

13
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.330
But you know, we can’t talk about Falcon
and the Winter Soldier being gay because Anthony

14
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.250
Mackey, who plays the titular Falcon, and
then the second iteration of Captain America,

15
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.149
said in an interview himself that the characters
are not gay.

16
00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.110
“So many things are twisted and convoluted.

17
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.360
There’s so many things that people latch
on to with their own devices to make themselves

18
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.289
relevant and rational.

19
00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.301
The idea of two guys being friends and loving
each other in 2021 is a problem because of

20
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.340
the exploitation of homosexuality.

21
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.910
It used to be guys can be friends, we can
hang out, and it was cool.

22
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.520
You would always meet your friends at the
bar, you know.

23
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.250
You can’t do that anymore, because something
as pure and beautiful as homosexuality has

24
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.610
been exploited by people who are trying to
rationalize themselves.

25
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.330
So something that’s always been very important
to me is showing a sensitive masculine figure.

26
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.800
There’s nothing more masculine than being
a superhero and flying around and beating

27
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.360
people up.

28
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.349
But there’s nothing more sensitive than
having emotional conversations and a kindred

29
00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.860
spirit friendship with someone that you care
about and love.”

30
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.670
Imagine that.

31
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.720
Something as beautiful as homosexuals being
exploited by…

32
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.720
Homosexuals.

33
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.050
Okay I’m not really sure what he thinks
is going on here.

34
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.450
Is he just under the impression that there’s
this horde of straight people who are clamoring

35
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.450
for gays on-screen?

36
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.780
I mean… there are.

37
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.349
It’s called shipping and it’s valid.

38
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.090
(Please ship responsibly.)

39
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.980
But a majority of the people reading into
the relationship between Sam and Bucky were

40
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.060
gay people.

41
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.439
And regardless of whether you’re gay or
straight, if you’re shipping characters

42
00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.599
it’s probably because you feel a little
starved for seeing actual on-screen representation.

43
00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.400
Or because you recognize natural romantic
chemistry between two characters that you’re

44
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.650
not quite sure how the creators missed.

45
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.659
Either way this seems like a weird place to
set up my soap box and address a topic that

46
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.090
apparently nobody thought was much of an issue.

47
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.260
And if Mackey wanted to speak to something
that actually is an issue, he could have acknowledged

48
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.909
the fact that Marvel films, in spite of evergreen
popularity and being the most expansive franchise

49
00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.540
in history, does not see fit to include something
as… beautiful as homosexuality in their

50
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540
movies.

51
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.810
Mackey could have also acknowledged that yes,
he did in fact, see the sheer amount of gay-baiting

52
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.419
in FatWS.

53
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.739
Intentional or not.

54
00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.519
But then I thought…

55
00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.519
Maybe it’s me.

56
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.260
Maybe I’m the problem.

57
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.019
Maybe it isn’t that obvious…

58
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.359
Like yes I know I get flamed for reading queerness
into things (even when it’s entirely appropriate).

59
00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.359
But come on…

60
00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.659
Sam and Bucky is kind of obvious, right?

61
00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.859
So no, I’m not the problem.

62
00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.829
Are the producers really that oblivious?

63
00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.300
They must have seen it when they watched it.

64
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.680
Because it’s hard to watch some parts and
take a straight reading away from it.

65
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.260
Nevermind that if either of them was a woman,
they would go out of their way to point out

66
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.610
the romantic tension.

67
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.900
We see that.

68
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.120
Queer-people, that is.

69
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120
We see the tension.

70
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.459
We see the looks, the touching, the closeness,
the rivals-to-lovers trope playing out in

71
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.510
full force.

72
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.390
I mean, how can a straight person look at
some of these plot elements, character beats,

73
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.000
and coded language and say:

74
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.020
“Oh yeah.

75
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.460
Bucky going into a complete tailspin over
the loss of his perfectly platonic friend

76
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.880
to whom he had become emotionally dependent
upon in order to navigate shared trauma was

77
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.240
absolutely a straight mood.”

78
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.090
My first question was: is there a point of
queer baiting where gays are sensitive enough

79
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.350
to pick up on the coded language, but straights
can’t see it?

80
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.020
Is gaydar actually a thing?

81
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.390
The answer to that apparently is: ‘yeah
probably.’

82
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.970
And if there is such a sweet spot, Disney
is getting very adept at hitting it.

83
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.730
In a way where moreso than any other American
studio, they love to plant their queer representation

84
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.900
in that sweet spot of the gays weeping at
their feet in gratitide for shreds of acknowledgement,

85
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.200
while the straights are, largely, too oblivious
to notice.

86
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.120
Which is a whole issue on it’s own.

87
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.320
Whereas other studios and networks seem to
either avoid gay topics altogether, or they

88
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.090
dive right in like Netflix.

89
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.490
The only other major form of media which seems
to like playing in this kind of representation

90
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.490
titillation game is anime.

91
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.030
Which I will get to.

92
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.360
But my follow up to that question about the
oversenstive queer rep-detection was: ‘When

93
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.360
we flock to twitter to talk about how this
coded media represents us… why are straight

94
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.040
people so willing to sitck up their noses
and tell us that we’re obviously mistaken.’

95
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.070
Representation gaslighting?

96
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.340
We literally lived these experiences.

97
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.540
Why are we being told that we’re mistaken
when we acknowledge our own lived experiences

98
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.010
being depicted either literally, or allegorically.

99
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.810
No wonder the gays all have anxiety disorders.

100
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.580
Look at all the overanalyzing we’re forced
to do!

101
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.700
Out of all the coded and baited content we’ve
been given over the years… have we reached

102
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.280
a point where straight people also have started
reading into it?

103
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.620
And now we’re at a point where, somehow,
the straights think that these queer expiriences

104
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.090
are actually part of the straight expirience?

105
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:25.300
There must be some kind of explanation for
this willful blindness.

106
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.580
So going over the previously mentioned example.

107
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.580
I’m assuming this is something that’s
ubiquitous enough that everybody has some

108
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.070
kind of opinion on it.

109
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.260
A discussion of the many ways in which Falcon
and the Winter Solider is stuffed full of

110
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.270
coded queer messaging has been done to death
by now.

111
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.730
But it’s worth revisiting it to sort of…
confront the perspective that this is somehow

112
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.070
straight.

113
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.560
Falcon and the Winter Soldier follows the
first adventure of Sam Wilson and James “Bucky”

114
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.450
Barns following the disappearance of Captain
America after the events of Endgame, Thanos’

115
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.130
invasion of Earth, and the reappearance of
everybody who had been ‘snapped’ by Thanos.

116
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.670
Sam and Bucky being among them.

117
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:12.650
Together, they have to combat a terrorist
group who is...

118
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.100
Fighting to assure that everyone is treated
with dignity, fairness, and afforded the appropriate

119
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.800
human rights.

120
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:27.340
So the ‘bad guys’ are a multinational
team headed by a mixed-race woman of colour

121
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.010
who are fighting for the people who didn’t
get snapped.

122
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.010
See.

123
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.000
Following the snap, or the blip, as it’s
called, half of the population disappeared.

124
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.860
Urban centres became virtual ghost towns and
rural areas became desolate.

125
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.930
There was a mass migration from impoverished
or rural nations towards the urban centres

126
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.650
of wealthy ones.

127
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.340
After a five-year span of everyone finally
starting to get a handle on things…

128
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.340
Bam!

129
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.340
Everyone comes back.

130
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.760
Global organizations began scrambling to organize
a smooth transition for ‘blipped’ people

131
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.580
to return to their homes and lives, as if
nothing had happened.

132
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:09.570
Unfortunately, this meant forcing former migrants
out of the places that had become their homes.

133
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.560
Leading to mass deportations and an even more
significant refugee crisis.

134
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.150
As organizers seemed to offer more resources
to people who had been blipped, the people

135
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.750
who had been there all along are forced into
refugee camps, shanty towns, and trapped in

136
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.760
a cycle of bureaucratic impoverishment.

137
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.760
The ‘Flag Smashers’ are an organization
which arose to steal resources to help these

138
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:39.260
people, and demand appropriate action from
world powers who simply labeled them as terrorists.

139
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.310
And they… were the bad guys?

140
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:46.120
Yeah it’s not a great look for a guy spangled
in the american flag to be fighting against

141
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.810
the impoverished of the world who are just
trying to organize and be heard by the global

142
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.980
powers.

143
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.200
Especially when one of the last shots in the
show was a bunch of people of colour being

144
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.950
murdered by a white guy with absolutely no
repercussions.

145
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.149
This doesn’t necessarily pertain to gay
themes.

146
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:04.200
Except for the fact that the Flag Smashers
fight for people who are shoved around, pushed

147
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.870
aside, and altogether are forgotten and ignored
by their leaders.

148
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.940
This is a very similar situation to how the
queer and gay communities have been treated

149
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.529
by our governments for a SIGNIFICANT portion
of history.

150
00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:19.590
But throughout this adventure is a running
plot of Sam and Bucky… not really liking

151
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.840
each other for some reason.

152
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.290
And it’s never really explained why?

153
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.370
So, when Mackey responds to the persistently
observed romantic chemistry between his own

154
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.491
captain america and Bucky, he seems very critical
of fans for engaging in his franchise in a

155
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:35.400
way he doesn’t like.

156
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.920
Especially when he himself is dismissing these
observations as predatorial — somehow — while

157
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.900
claiming to be protecting something as beautiful
as homosexuality from people who want to see

158
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.310
heroic homosexuals and homosexuals themselves
on screen.

159
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.640
While seemingly ignoring the substantial ways
in which he and Sebastian Stan were written

160
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.990
and directed to be romantic.

161
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.210
You’ve got the rolling-in-the-grass scene
which… is a staple of romantic action movies

162
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.240
for decades.

163
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240
A literal couples’ therapy session.

164
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.020
There are the looks, the touching, and all
the other normal rivals-to-lovers character

165
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020
beats.

166
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.200
Bucky’s reference to his dating life where
everyone had tiger pictures in their profile.

167
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.480
Which… is a very vague reference to a brief
trend on Tindr where guys would post pictures

168
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.050
where they were petting tigers.

169
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.540
So you know which gender he’s looking up
on Tindr.

170
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.279
Which, YES these are very specific, vague,
uses of film language that can be very easily

171
00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:29.279
passed-over.

172
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.920
But for the last… what?

173
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.710
100 years of cinema, this was the only way
that we were ever represented so we’re very

174
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.580
used to reading into these cues.

175
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.210
I’m sorry that some writer thought it would
be funny to put it there.

176
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.140
And it’s not like Mackey bears the sole
responsibility for the queer denial of obvious

177
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.460
queer coding.

178
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.310
Director Kari Skogland spoke specifically
to the Tiger Pictures throwaway reference

179
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.310
saying:

180
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.790
““I think we just thought of it as an
oddity of the times, because he’s so confused

181
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.790
by it,”

182
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.790
I mean, I’m 32.

183
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.010
And I’m confused by the need to post a picture
of yourself with a tiger in a dating profile.

184
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.520
Apparently straight guys are big on posting
pictures of them with fish?

185
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.810
Anyway that’s an incredibly specific reference,
relating to an incredibly specific social

186
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.540
phenomenon just to get dismissed away with
a shallow explanation like that.

187
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.120
And because we’re gay, we read into these
things.

188
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.470
Is this a secret covert gay coup that the
showrunners are planning?

189
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.240
To subvbert Disney’s heterosexual agenda
by sneaking in gay stuff and then publicly

190
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.330
denying it?

191
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.290
Because this is so obvious, there’s no way
that the writers just thoughtlessly threw

192
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.420
in a line that's specifically tied to a singular,
temporary event in recent history that neither

193
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.880
really fits nor does it really enrich the
story.

194
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.460
Given the way Disney’s writer assembly line
churns out these scripts so meticulously,

195
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.339
it seems weird that it would just be there
for no reason.

196
00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:53.300
Then again this is the same show which has
Sam saving the day by giving a speech to a

197
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.910
bunch of politicians which convinces them
to pursue the best interests of the people.

198
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.910
“Sure, Jan.”

199
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:04.810
You’ve got a show about a genetically-altered
super soldier, a World War 2 soldier who was

200
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:10.620
brainwashed into being a Soviet assassin,
and a pilot with wings becoming a symbol of

201
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.640
American idealism.

202
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.120
And somehow politicians bending to the benefit
of the populace at large is the most unbelievable

203
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
thing.

204
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.710
I mean there’s a whole discourse around
how fiction establishes fantasy worlds which

205
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.490
exist under a certain set of rules, but still
require a certain element of social connectivity

206
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.810
to our reality.

207
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.940
But that’s not this video.

208
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.600
And honestly videos about literary theory
like that are probably not in the works.

209
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600
Unless you’d like to see that.

210
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.430
If so, leave a comment below.

211
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.430
Engagement!

212
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:44.070
So what concerns me most about the Sam and
Bucky ship-slash-non-ship is that it was so

213
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.830
clear and obvious without being explicitly
stated.

214
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:53.200
So no, I don’t believe that the writers
were oblivious and no, I don’t believe they’re

215
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.040
secretly trying to hustle some sweet-sweet
gay superhero action into the show.

216
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.790
Keep in mind the popularity of Stucky.

217
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.330
It was so prevalent, that one might hazard
a guess that the ongoing popularity of Chris

218
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.910
Evans’ Captain America was owed to the fan
fervour for the meta-fictitious romance with

219
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.620
Stan’s Bucky.

220
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.880
Also keep in mind that romantic tension between
Steve and Bucky was never explicitly written

221
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.730
or directed into the story.

222
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.950
Instead, it just naturally grew out of the
performances of these two actors.

223
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.220
Contrast that against Falcon and the Winter
Soldier — where it was so brazen it almost

224
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.520
hurt to watch.

225
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.550
So my worry is that these NEW gay references
with plausible dieniability came directly

226
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.029
from the executives.

227
00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:35.830
As a way to kinda… fan the flames for Stucky
and fast-track whatever ship name Sam and

228
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.830
Bucky have.

229
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.830
Sucky?

230
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.830
Sacky?

231
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.830
Sake?

232
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.830
Bam???

233
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.339
The ongoing gay-baity rumours certainly helped
the show cycle around gay media, and earn

234
00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:46.130
a lot of shares and engagement on gay social
media.

235
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.240
Is this a very calculated move designed to
get some extra engagement for these characters

236
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.060
by making it so oblivious to us, the gays,
while even the actors and directors are prone

237
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.530
to write it off as ‘just normal straight
boys’?

238
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.550
Us gays are pretty good at getting things
to trend on Twitter, after all.

239
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.420
Sure, at first there’s the initial annoyance
of Gay-baiting.

240
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.340
And then I just get a little… uncomfortable?

241
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.030
That very clear gay expiriences are being
lifted from gay stories (where they belong)

242
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.720
and then thrown into a piece of media that
everyone — okay a lot of people — come

243
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.720
away with the belief that these are perfectly
straight expiriences.

244
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720
Like.

245
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.230
On one hand, yes, dismantling toxic masculinity
means making it acceptable for two straight

246
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.600
men to be emotionally intimate with each other.

247
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.460
But on the other hand, there is a bi-or-homophobic
reading of that where a dude’s masculinity

248
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.459
is tough enough to be emotional with bros,
but still fragile enough not to bite the bullet

249
00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.029
and just…

250
00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:40.610
You know?

251
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.800
Instead it just goes like:

252
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
“HEY GUYS.

253
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800
IT’S OKAY.

254
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.850
I’M NOT *ACTUALLY* GAY.

255
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.620
I’M JUST EMOTIONAL WITH MY BROS.

256
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.070
I’M NOT GAY.”

257
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:53.340
That statement, while seeming to fight against
patriarchal values of masculinity, actually

258
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:59.170
re-enforces an existing hierarchy where straight
is closer to masculinity than gay is.

259
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.040
It’s like the woke-man’s way to say no-homo.

260
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040
So.

261
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.209
Why is Mr. Mackey, so quick to deffend homosexuality,
while at the same time doing everything he

262
00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:11.050
can to affirm Sam Wilson’s heterosexuality?

263
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.930
Instead of saying that art is in the eye of
the beholder, and that whether the character

264
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.500
is straight or gay would not detract from
his accomplishments and interpersonal relationships?

265
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:26.460
The real kick in the proverbial balls was
that these comments dropped in Pride month.

266
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:33.300
And — unfortunately, Anthony Mackey’s
no-homo comments set a precedent for Disney

267
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.029
all month long.

268
00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:42.930
Gonna be upfront.

269
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.930
I loved Loki.

270
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.100
I would have actually got to love it a whole
bunch more if social media wasn’t swarmed

271
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.900
with bi/pan Loki celebrations and debates.

272
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.560
Oh god this is gonna be a mess.

273
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.660
I’m gonna get cancelled.

274
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.209
But in the case of Loki…

275
00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:59.160
I’m just not sure if it qualifies as representation.

276
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:06.260
I realize the point about me being an exclusively
gay man is that *I* don’t need to feel represented

277
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.260
by Loki.

278
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.060
But just in a matter of tallying the sum of
the show’s part’s I’m not wholly sure

279
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.430
how anyone could.

280
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.450
In the words of Russell T. Davies, the creator
of Queer As Folk, he said this about Loki:

281
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.700
“Loki makes one reference to being bisexual
once, and everyone’s like, ‘Oh my god,

282
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.450
it’s like a pansexual show.’

283
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.470
It’s like one word.

284
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.760
He said the word ‘prince,’ and we’re
meant to go, ‘Thank you, Disney!

285
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.510
Aren’t you marvelous?’

286
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.690
It’s pathetic.”

287
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.399
This is a queer creator who, in the 1990s
and Early 2000s, ran a show about open and

288
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.380
explicitly gay, lesbian, and bisexual characters.

289
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.040
And in this formula, Queer as Folk was so
popular on Showtime that it’s runtime had

290
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.510
to get extended by an extra 15 minutes because
the network was selling more adspace than

291
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.450
would fit in just an hour-long timeslot.

292
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:58.090
And if that aired in the early 2000s — entering
into Bush-era america — why does our bisexual

293
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.519
Loki only get a one-line vaguary about princes?

294
00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:03.519
And no.

295
00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:07.030
Nobody’s asking for Tom Hiddleston to have
a full-contact sex scene.

296
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:12.019
Loki is neither the place for that, nor would
any marvel movie benefit from a sex scene.

297
00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:13.019
And sure.

298
00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:19.110
We can still have the Loki-Sylvi love plot
but like… some more significant references

299
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.750
to bisexuality would be more appreciated.

300
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.890
Film and television are visual mediums, and
if there is a component of your story that

301
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.390
is not represented visually, then it has failed
in a significant way.

302
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.730
Also because, if necessary, that little ‘prince
and or princess’ exchange between Sylvie

303
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.500
and Loki can be removed and it wouldn’t
change the story.

304
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.980
According to rumours, when Mobius imprisons
Loki in a time loop, it was initially going

305
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.250
to be Loki getting kneed in the balls by a
jilted lover — a man.

306
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:53.070
Which would have been a great way to call
attention to the bisexuality of his character,

307
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.940
because it references a former MLM trist without
obstructing the developing romance between

308
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.760
Loki and Sylvie.

309
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.840
For what it is.

310
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:06.180
But a problem with bisexual representation
is two things.

311
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.770
First, that Bisexual characters are usually
depicted as villains.

312
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:15.540
It’s a way to paint villains as being deviant,
by saying they’re excessively horny perverts

313
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.540
who want men and women.

314
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:23.179
An additional problem with Loki verbally confirming
bisexuality is that Loki’s, in the MCU and

315
00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:29.080
the source material, are very well known for
being liars.

316
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.210
Especially while he’s in a situation where
he’s trying to manipulate Sylvie, there’s

317
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:39.410
greater textual evidence to suggest that he’s
trying to relate to her by earning her trust.

318
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.650
Can we really take that as substantial evidence?

319
00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:47.270
But the second problem is that Bisexualiuty
has, in many instances in film and television,

320
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.430
been used as a ‘cop-out’ for self-congratulatory
queer representation.

321
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.220
And then sitcking the bisexual character in
excsluvely heterosexual romances.

322
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.520
Which is annoying, and maybe even a contributing
factor to some of the animosity towards bisexual

323
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.910
identity in queer circles.

324
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.340
And no, bisexuals don't owe anyone ‘proof’
of anything.

325
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.010
Especially because identity is internal.

326
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.320
However fiction has different rules.

327
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.000
All we can verify of a given character is
what, we, the audience sees on screen.

328
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.950
Any verbal references and assumptions can
be dismissed.

329
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.790
There’s actually a rule in TV and film that
unless you see a character die — there is

330
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.580
no proof that they are dead.

331
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.930
And that normally holds up.They can pop back
up at any time.

332
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.280
So Loki can talk about his past all he wants,
but unless we have flashbacks or other indications

333
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.020
— we, as an audience, can’t truly accept
what is said.

334
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.150
Which is… exactly what Disney wants.

335
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.260
They want to say they have diversity without
doing anything to commit to it.

336
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.870
It’s one thing to be struggling to force
our own presence into media, but now we’re

337
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.809
just asking to be represented in media that
is controlled by straight people.

338
00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:56.930
Which means our representation is essentially
‘gifted’ to us, and that we ought to be

339
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.390
grateful no matter how it comes out.

340
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.390
Which inevitably sets a precedence for straight
creators deciding what is and is not acceptable

341
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.900
queer representation.

342
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.790
Which is limited to what they’re comfortable
depicting, and to experiences they are aware

343
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.790
of.

344
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.720
You’d think Loki wouldn’t have this problem
given that the head showrunner was, herself,

345
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720
bisexual.

346
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.799
However, her willingness to depict honest
bisexual expiriences were prevented by executives

347
00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:22.860
and producers.

348
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.390
So her creative vision was limited by what
the producers were comfortable with.

349
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.520
And their agendas remain ambiguous,

350
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.820
Suffice to say.

351
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:36.310
After all the effort to slip that one line
of bisexuality into the show, guess who didnt

352
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.780
get invited back for the second season of
Loki?

353
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.780
…

354
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.780
...Her.

355
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.930
Everyone else is coming back.

356
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.990
Not her.

357
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.780
But forget about even bisexuality, because
apparently the straights can’t wrap their

358
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.160
head around that for some reason — Loki
tried to go a step further and serve some

359
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.640
nonbinary representation as well.

360
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.720
And… well…

361
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.890
It was an attempt.

362
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.560
In the first episode of the show, we see an
identification card that depicts Loki’s

363
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.540
‘sex’ as ‘fluid.’

364
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.260
To a lot of the uninformed, this is great
nonbinary representation.

365
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:13.530
To the young queers who still have a twinkle
of optimism in their eye, this is a great

366
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.530
first step.

367
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.650
To those of us who have nonbinary friends
who are old enough to become cynical about

368
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.650
it.

369
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:20.650
This is annoying.

370
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.160
I feel like they wanted to drop in a queer
nod, but didn’t really feel it was important

371
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.390
to switch up their gritty, 70s bureau aesthetic.

372
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.150
Or that the ‘fluidity’ was referencing
Loki’s shapeshifting abilities which…

373
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.860
I’m not sure if he’s even shape-shifted
into a woman in the MCU.

374
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.980
But either way, Loki’s abilities in the
films are focused around creating illusions

375
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.919
which distract from the reality.

376
00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.900
Not actually changing his chromosomes.

377
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.260
He does in the comics!

378
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.940
But not in the movies.

379
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.600
Also damning is how, in spite of the TVA’s
‘wokeness’ around including ‘fluid’

380
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.360
on the intake form, literally everyone in
the show’s early episodes makes an explicit

381
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.950
point of referring to Loki as a man.

382
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.831
Again, which is reprised when Hiddletson’s
Loki asks the other Lokis if they’ve ever

383
00:22:03.831 --> 00:22:06.980
met a woman loki to which they shudder and
say ‘no.’

384
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.070
Sexism lite, okay…

385
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:16.679
But if Loki is ‘sex-fluid’ why would a
qualification about man and woman even matter?

386
00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:20.400
The inability of the showrunners to distinguish
a difference between sex and gender is not

387
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.530
a trait that they want to share with TERFs.

388
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.620
And this is, I think we will find going forward,
a problem that will become more and more prevalent

389
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.620
in media.

390
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:34.110
Because it seems to me that media in which
we are explicitly represented is the least

391
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.080
likely to contain any kind of queer expiriences.

392
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.460
Other than maybe coming out.

393
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:45.950
And yet, we find a myriad of our experiences
in stories where we are not explicitly represented.

394
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.179
Which then annoys us to no end because we
have to submit a formal research thesis when

395
00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:54.340
we try and convince people that these are,
in fact, our experiences.

396
00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:03.740
Which… this has happened a lot this year
at Disney…

397
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:10.720
There wasn’t really any early indication
that Raya and the Last Dragon was going to

398
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.830
be gay but.

399
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.020
Here we are.

400
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.840
When the movie hit Disney+, there was A swarm
of lesbians fans who picked up on all the

401
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.010
innuendos that were too subtle for most of
the straights to see.

402
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:26.390
Whereas my discussion for Falcon and the Winter
Solider was focused around how gay-coded expiriences

403
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.309
are being co-opted into normative masculinity,
and how Loki was about the erasure of bisexuality

404
00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:36.730
and nonbinary expiriences in lieu of vague
self-identification which does not necessarily

405
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:42.090
match the characters’ portrayal, Raya speaks
to a phenomenon that has already happened.

406
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.170
Gal pals.

407
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.169
On a first watch of Raya, I saw some cute
chemistry between Raya and the antagonist,

408
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:49.169
Namaari.

409
00:23:49.169 --> 00:23:53.830
I thought, sure it’s there if you want to
see it but it could just be an instance of

410
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.410
girls being friends.

411
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.570
And then I listened to exactly what had just
come out of my mouth.

412
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.511
Because in spite of the aggressive gay flirting
in Raya and the Last dragon (not to mention

413
00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:10.480
the pet name which roughly translates to ‘Strangely
Beutiful’) I had been conditioned by society

414
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.249
to just write it off as just girl things.

415
00:24:13.249 --> 00:24:18.220
The permissibility of girls to be emotional,
and thus, emotionally and physically close

416
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.660
with each other has made it difficult for
lesbians to exist in visible ways.

417
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.150
Not that girls shouldn’t be emotional, but
there must be some lingering homophobia around

418
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.480
to look at two girls holding hands and say:
“BFFs” before girlfriends.

419
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.570
We really ought to look at lesbian erasure
and get concerned for the future of queer

420
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.600
representation.

421
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.320
That one day, maybe one day soon, our stories
and expressions are going to be swallowed

422
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.220
into an amoebous heap of “HEY IT’S ACTUALLY
STRAIGHT AFTER ALL” media.

423
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.020
Where the identities that queer people have
struggled and endured to live and validate

424
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:56.240
will be depicted through straight characters
who have not had any suffering associated

425
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.620
with their straightness.

426
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.400
Not that Raya herself had many elements of
her story as being coded queer.

427
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.800
Her suffering is more related to a literal
apocalypse than alienation, social ridicule,

428
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.660
or willful parental abandonment.

429
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.890
But the ways in which she expresses a very
tumultuous physical attraction to a rival

430
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.350
really should not require a heterosexual explination.

431
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:22.059
And yet when people try to argue in favour
Raya’s gay leanings, they are met with corrections

432
00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:25.400
specifying that these are, in fact, straight
things.

433
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.420
And that lesbians are just reading too much
into it.

434
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.919
And even though the voice of Raya, Kelly Marie
Tran, confirmed in interviews that her portrayal

435
00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:37.470
of Raya was intendedly gay, there is still
a persistent wall of denial.

436
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.470
Well.

437
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.170
If Raya was too subtle, Disney was going to
double-down on squashing rumours of gays in

438
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.210
their studio.

439
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:50.370
In Pride month, of all times.

440
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.120
Pixar’s Luca was set to come out in–

441
00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.789
Well, he wasn’t going to come out, but the
movie WAS gonna get released in June of 2021.

442
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:04.730
And from the first trailer, the word on gay
Twitter was “Calamari by Your Name”.

443
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.620
Actually, it was all of Twitter.

444
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.679
Film YouTube was abuz about how Disney had
finally made a gay animated movie.

445
00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:14.559
Straight guys were excited to see Disney’s
version of Call me By Your Name meets The

446
00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:15.700
Shape of Water.

447
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.930
By the time the movie hit Disney+, I was half-convinced
they were actually gonna do it.

448
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.930
But no.

449
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:21.930
They’re just.

450
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.930
Very good friends.

451
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:42.410
Just a… question for all the affirmed straight
men watching this right now, all two of you.

452
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:52.830
Is it gay to—

453
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.440
Okay.

454
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.420
So the movie was unabashedly blunt in its
depiction of literally every gay man’s gay

455
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.080
expirience growing up gay.

456
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.929
And yet, director, Enrico Casarosa, was absolutely
ardent in his denial that the film was gay

457
00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:10.929
in anyway.

458
00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:11.929
Thanks Mickey!

459
00:27:11.929 --> 00:27:15.910
Yeah they’re gonna slap our community-generated
flags on Mickey Mouse ears and sell our identity

460
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.720
back to us at a mark-up sure.

461
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.530
But they’re also going to — ONCE AGAIN
— make it very clear that there are no gay

462
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.330
characters in Disney Movies.

463
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.470
And when there ARE gay characters… are they
REALLY?

464
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.870
Thank god for the Eternals…

465
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.250
Unless they kill the husband.

466
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.460
Please don’t kill the husband.

467
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.950
But Luca is… of course, an instance of a
very clear-as-day gay expirience whose literal

468
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.240
climatic sequence was about showing your true
colours—

469
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.410
That once again meets a wall of straight people
who say: “Yes.

470
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.150
This is an absolutely heterosexual thing to
exprience.

471
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.150
Yes.

472
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.150
Getting disowned.

473
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.400
Having your family threaten to send you away
because you’re ‘curious.’

474
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.770
Found family of misfits.

475
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.770
Et cetera.

476
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.770
Et cetera.”

477
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.770
Apparently that’s all straight now.

478
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.470
“Some people… they'll never accept him.

479
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.990
But some will.

480
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.549
And he seems to know how to find the good
ones.”

481
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.950
Certainly not the first time Disney made an
animated movie about fish people with heavy

482
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.950
gay undertones.

483
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.351
I don’t even understand why this is a debate
— Hans Christen Anderson invented ‘fish

484
00:28:11.351 --> 00:28:14.289
people as a literary genre’ and he himself
was quoted saying:

485
00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:15.289
“Yeah.

486
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:16.840
Fish are pretty gay.”

487
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.350
Actually with Luca there wasn’t as much
of that as I was worried about.

488
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.640
The director notwithstanding.

489
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.850
And Disney actually got their voice actors
to shut up about gay readings this time.

490
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.520
Until Jack Dylan Grazer, voice of Alberto,
came out as bisexual soon after its release.

491
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.530
Glub-glub hun-ty.

492
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.540
But still.

493
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.429
A lot of straight people I saw even heaped
on the pile of gay fish boys.

494
00:28:37.429 --> 00:28:41.520
...I’m... sure there was a better way to
phrase that but I’m not sure that I should…

495
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.540
Anyway, the coding in Luca was so obvious
that even straight people looked at it and

496
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.590
said yep they pretty gay.’

497
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:53.200
In fact, recently director Enrico Casarosa
gave comments where he admitted how there

498
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.030
could be a gay reading of his film.

499
00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.510
You know… because apparently he finally
decided to watch it.

500
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.670
But even among straight people who agreed
that the fish boys were pretty gay, they gave

501
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:09.830
Disney a pass because ‘they were just kids’
and apparently kids aren’t allowed to be

502
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.830
gay.

503
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.830
Which…

504
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.370
I have more than a few words to say about
that.

505
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:20.510
But as Disney is a media producer that specifically
develops media for children, isn’t that

506
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.480
always going to be the defence?

507
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.870
That having gays in their media is too mature
for children.

508
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.490
Which I’d like to ask what these straight
people think needs to be depicted in order

509
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.000
for it to be gay.

510
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.730
Because that is, and continues to be the rallying
cry for Disney’s systemic removal of queer

511
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.640
content which neither codes nor brushes off
these identities.

512
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.840
Casualties of this include Love, Victor being
shafted to Hulu, and The Owl House having

513
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.400
its final season cut short once it moved to
Disney+.

514
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.480
There, I mentioned Owl House.

515
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.730
Are You happy now?

516
00:29:52.730 --> 00:30:00.300
It’s not just the fact that I’m annoyed
at the ongoing queer coding.

517
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.270
Because I am annoyed, and I’m very willing
to continue making videos about how annoyed

518
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.270
I am.

519
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:10.570
But it’s particularly annoying here because
we’re seeing in real time our identities

520
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.360
being removed from our range of experiences.

521
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.330
And then an errant denial that these were
ever our experiences to begin with.

522
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.440
And it’s this denial that Disney is fostering.

523
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.220
That the stories that queer creators have
been waitng generations to depict in their

524
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.530
unabridged forms, are actually straight stories.

525
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.179
And that they have been all along.

526
00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:34.980
And if these stories are straight stories,
than what’s the point in having queer people

527
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.090
tell these stories?

528
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.120
Or be depicted in these stories?

529
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.380
Instead, the role of queer characters is simply
to self-declare and move on to the next scene.

530
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.740
If we’re in it at all.

531
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.370
We’re not going to reach public acceptance
if we allow the people who don’t want us

532
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.860
around to dictate the terms of our existence.

533
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.860
WE’RE HERE.

534
00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.860
WE’RE QUEER.

535
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.179
(Except if we’re causing a fuss, we don’t
want to upset anyone.)

536
00:30:56.179 --> 00:31:00.429
Because committing to visual depictions of
homosexuality or bisexuality — just a lil’

537
00:31:00.429 --> 00:31:05.150
smootch, or even holding hands, or some romantic
dialogue — would be confronting a group

538
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:10.950
of people who ‘just don’t think homosexual
content should be directed at children.’

539
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.169
Nevermind that out of anyone, it is queer
children who need this media the most.

540
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:19.340
Queer children are coming into a world where
they may not have real-life role models or

541
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.280
family who are like them.

542
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.490
Feeling that alone and isolated is a huge
contributing factor for anxiety and depression

543
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.150
among queer youth, and adults too.

544
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:33.030
Having media to supplement what is missing
in real life is the best way for people to

545
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.679
see shared experiences.

546
00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:38.900
But those messages aren’t going to come
across the way they need to if these experiences

547
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:44.299
are removed from identifiable queer characters,
and then appropreated into media depicting

548
00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:45.640
straight people.

549
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.240
And when it comes to separating our identities
from our experiences, that isn’t even the

550
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.390
only problem.

551
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.059
Namely, that people are more likely to take
fiction as reality.

552
00:31:55.059 --> 00:32:00.419
And by trusting fiction, and what the creators
say about their fiction, we are letting that

553
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:04.429
mould and shape our cultural idea of reality.

554
00:32:04.429 --> 00:32:08.520
And if queer people are not in that reality
that’s bad.

555
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.740
If media establishes expectations about queerness
that are not true, that’s going to be bad

556
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.779
for queer people who are trying to figure
out how to fit into the world.

557
00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:21.799
And it’s bad for straight and cis people
who are trying to relate to us, and becoming

558
00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:25.570
frustrated that we aren’t like how we are
in the media they watch.

559
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.179
Somehow, we went from fighting to tell our
stories, to setting up media producers as

560
00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:32.559
the gatekeepers of what is or is not a valid.

561
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:36.450
And I can’t quite say why we are so complicit.

562
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:42.470
But somehow, Disney especially, established
itself as the cultural touchstone of identity.

563
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.200
Disney doesn’t decide what matters.

564
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200
We do.

565
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.120
And yet there’s this precedence that when
Disney makes a movie about you — you’ve

566
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.549
made it.

567
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:54.990
Once you get your Black Panther, or your Moana,
or your Raya, Mulan, your Coco… you’ve

568
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.690
been accepted into the Disney dictated world
of legitimacy.

569
00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.120
It makes people feel seen.

570
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.570
It makes people feel included.

571
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:02.730
Especially for kids.

572
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.679
But gay kids don’t get that.

573
00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:08.750
There’s no gay superhero or Disney princess
or prince for them to look to.

574
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.799
And you might say, there’s a historical
figure for them to look up to.

575
00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:13.799
Sure.

576
00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:14.799
But media matter.

577
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:20.279
And as far as media, especially Disney, gay
kids don’t exist.

578
00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:25.799
So maybe we should explain that, actually,
do they.
