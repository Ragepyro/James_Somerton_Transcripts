00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
you're sitting in a PAC theater the
lights go down and you can hear a

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.889
whisper of anticipation ripple through
the crowd but then it goes silent before

3
00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.010
the movie even begins you're already on
edge or maybe you're sitting alone at

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.210
night in bed do you feel safe until you
open up the book on your bedside table a

5
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.109
Stephen King classic that gives you
chills even though you've read it ten

6
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.559
times you're curled up on your couch
it's late at night the lights are off

7
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
and you're about to watch the latest
episode of a TV show that gives you

8
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.480
nightmares these three situations all
end with a smile as you laugh at

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.780
yourself for being afraid we love being
afraid horror movies books and TV shows

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.270
give us a thrill that's hardwired into
us as human beings the thrill of being

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.550
afraid
having your pulse race muscles tense but

12
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.680
knowing in the end that you're safe

13
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.939
I fell in love with horror movies when I
was six years old that's when I saw

14
00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.560
Friday the 13th part 7 a new blood for
the very first time it was my first

15
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.600
slasher movie and my first horror movie
in general and besides being kind of

16
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.619
shocked to see blood on the screen for
the first time I wasn't the least bit

17
00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.520
scared
granted Friday the 13th part 7 is more

18
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.350
akin to an x-men movie than Texas
Chainsaw Massacre the main character

19
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.149
literally kills Jason by using psychic
powers but it was still a horror movie

20
00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.420
and a great gateway to the genre for the
next two decades I devoured that genre

21
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.170
I had a shelf dedicated to my horror
movie VHS a--'s DVDs and now blu-rays

22
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.259
Halloween Friday the 13th
Nightmare on Elm Street Hellraiser Texas

23
00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.429
Chainsaw Massacre all the greats I
eventually moved on to the grandparents

24
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.319
of the horror genre the Universal
Monsters Dracula Frankenstein the

25
00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.310
Wolfman the mummy and the Invisible Man
and in my mid-teens after letting

26
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.639
everyone know that I was gay and getting
to know more people in the queer

27
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:28.569
community I came to a realization gays
really love horror movies of course

28
00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.100
there are exceptions I still can't get
my roommate to watch 2017 it but for the

29
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.329
most part it seemed like every gay guy
and girl absolutely adored horror movies

30
00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.690
from the top-tier ones like The Exorcist
to the bottom of the rung

31
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.380
direct-to-video sequels to the
Leprechaun child's play and sleepaway

32
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.120
camp there's even a massive amount of
gay themed slasher movies on Netflix

33
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.750
usually involving frat brothers so where
did this gay fascination with horror

34
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.069
come from James Jenkins of vallencourt
books notes that the connection between

35
00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.720
gay fiction and horror goes all the way
back to the gothic novels of the early

36
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
1800s many gothic authors Lake Matthew
Lewis William Thomas Beckford and

37
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.419
Francis Latham were gay and that
reflected in their work according to

38
00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.769
Jenkins the traditional explanation for
the gay horror connection is that it was

39
00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.090
impossible for them to write openly
about gay themes back then or even

40
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.019
perhaps express them at all since words
like gay and homosexual didn't exist so

41
00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.150
they sublimated them and express them in
more acceptable forms using the medium

42
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.379
of a transgressive
genre like horror in 1890 Lippincott's

43
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.430
monthly magazine commissioned a short
story by then little-known author Oscar

44
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.049
Wilde that would eventually become the
novel the Picture of Dorian Gray the

45
00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.500
story follows the titular Dorian Gray
who has had a portrait painted by an

46
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.030
artist named basil once he's seen the
portrait he wishes that it would grow

47
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.280
old and age instead of him and his wish
having been granted the portrait becomes

48
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.319
a twisted reflection of Dorian's
deviance and vices the wish for eternal

49
00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.829
youth is certainly present in gay
culture but the dandyism of the Picture

50
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.730
of Dorian Gray is much more obvious in
other parts of the work for instance

51
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.799
when basil has his first meeting with
Dorian Gray when our eyes met I felt I

52
00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:19.000
was growing pale a curious sensation of
Terror came over me I knew that I had

53
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.430
come face to face with someone whose
mere personality was so fascinating that

54
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.760
if I allowed it to do so it would absorb
my whole nature my whole soul my very

55
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.490
art itself and then later saying we were
quite close almost touching later in the

56
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.050
novel Lord Henry a dear friend of the
artist basil says to Dorian you mr. gray

57
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.310
you yourself with your rose red you thin
your rose white boy hood you have had

58
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.300
passions that have made you afraid
thoughts that have filled you with

59
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.669
terror daydreams and sleeping dreams
whose mere memory might stain your

60
00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.050
cheeks with shame Oscar Wilde does not
present any of the characters in a

61
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.849
picture of dorian gray as overtly
homosexual in fact Lord Henry is married

62
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.260
and Dorian begins dating an actress but
he's more in love with the art of her

63
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.610
acting in fact when she tells him that
she'll stop acting to be with him he

64
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.800
dumps her and he's not the slightest bit
upset to hear about her suicide in 2005

65
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.860
Joseph Carroll professor of philosophy
and literature at the University of

66
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.300
Missouri wrote among heterosexuals
feminine characteristics act as a

67
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.949
stimulus or trigger for male sexual
desire one chief reason a feminine see

68
00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.520
can be easily integrated with a
homoerotic persona is that a feminine

69
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.450
see indirectly suggests that the
effeminate male could himself be an

70
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.410
object of male desire early
in the story before the more

71
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.570
supernatural elements kick in Dorian is
upset that the portrait will forever

72
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.590
remain beautiful and young while he will
wither and aged the tears welled in his

73
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.260
eyes he tore his hand away and flinging
himself on the divan he buried his face

74
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.970
in the cushions as though he were
praying Joseph Carroll finds scenes of

75
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.170
women lying thrown and weeping are
common enough in Victorian fiction but

76
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.720
scenes depicting males in that posture
are vanishingly rare once the novel saw

77
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.940
its final publication at least for the
1800s

78
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.130
critics zeroed in on the effeminacy of
the novel especially the main character

79
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.810
over the next century critics and fans
would discover the more overt

80
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.680
homosexuality in Oscar Wilde's most
famous work now instead of pulling

81
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.160
quotes from novels and intellectual
articles for the rest of the video I'm

82
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.970
going to start focusing on more modern
interpretations of gay horror and I'd

83
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.100
like to talk about the worlds the most
famous monster that you never knew was

84
00:06:48.100 --> 00:07:00.479
analog ously queer Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein or the modern prometheus

85
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.290
Victor Frankenstein the titular mad
scientist shows little to no interest in

86
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.360
his wife-to-be and is determined to
create life on his own his own perfect

87
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.190
man something explored without subtlety
in the Rocky Horror Picture Show

88
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.550
but when digging up the body parts that
he'll eventually use to compile the

89
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.479
monster he makes sure to pick the
sexiest body parts he can find he wants

90
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.070
an Adonis just like Frank inverter once
born against his own free will as we all

91
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.169
are Frankenstein's monster is rejected
by its creator as something terrible a

92
00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:37.570
regretful mistake that ought to be done
away with

93
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.950
he even flees from the monster because
it's so hideous Frankenstein's reaction

94
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.580
to the birth of his creation isn't that
far off from the reaction of many overly

95
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.120
religious parents when they find out
that their child is gay they look at

96
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.410
them as monsters ungodly and although
most of these parents don't actually

97
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.240
attempt to kill their children though
that does happen

98
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.069
they may cut them out of their lives an
emotional murder if you will but at the

99
00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.259
same time there is a homoerotic subtext
between Victor Frankenstein and his

100
00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:10.940
monster the monster tracks down his
creator and Victor discovers that the

101
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.949
monster is intelligent well-read and
curious he is extensively everything a

102
00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:19.970
man like Victor would want a lover
there's a direct connection between them

103
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.199
Victor's repulsion toward the monster
could read as the Victorian equivalent

104
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:28.610
of no fats no fems every time
Frankenstein's creature sometimes refer

105
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.979
to as Adam is seen by the local
population he's met with horror he

106
00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:37.690
hasn't done anything to them but they
look at him as a monster anyway and

107
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.709
rejection drives him to become the
monster they see him as eventually Adam

108
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:47.420
begs Victor to create for him a mate
he just wants someone like him someone

109
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:53.029
who knows his struggles someone to share
his life with he like any other person

110
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:57.170
deserves as much sound familiar though
Victor initially agrees he eventually

111
00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.649
destroys the potential bride Adam the
monster is not allowed to have a mate

112
00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:07.760
not allowed to have someone to love and
be loved by because he's a monster

113
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.970
he's not like normal people he doesn't
deserve to have what everyone else does

114
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:18.290
because he is different and so you see
the parallels between Frankenstein's

115
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.870
monster and being gay now this all
changed a little bit with the film

116
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:29.120
adaptation James Whale himself a gay
director helmed 1931 s Frankenstein and

117
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.500
it's 1935 sequel the Bride of
Frankenstein whales oddly made sure to

118
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.300
remove the more overt homoerotic subtext
between Victor and his monster by adding

119
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.930
the character of Fritz for Victor to
speak with and by making the monster

120
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.850
mute and also making Victor much more
socially active off-topic but Fritz is

121
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.450
the character we've all come to known as
Igor for some reason also Victor is

122
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.170
inexplicably renamed Henry in the movie
but I'm gonna stick to calling him

123
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.770
Victor for the sake of consistency
Victor is also much more socially active

124
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.700
in the movies as I said adding a further
layer of separation between him and the

125
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.720
monster Victor's relationship with his
wife-to-be Elizabeth is also much more

126
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.890
prominent in the films she's an active
part of his life even being there for

127
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.040
the
of the monster indeed the films never

128
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.449
seem to question Victor's sexuality but
on the contrary repeatedly emphasized

129
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:21.589
his heterosexuality whereas the novel
leaves this aspect of Victor's character

130
00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:26.300
more open to discussion the novels
Victor is obsessed with the creature who

131
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:32.029
repeatedly makes his pulse beat faster
and his brows sweat in 1935 s the Bride

132
00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:35.990
of Frankenstein the queerness is more
obvious an old friend of dr.

133
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.250
Frankenstein's doctor Septimus Pretorius
interrupts the evening of his wedding

134
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.040
with the request that they partner up to
create life

135
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.779
stopping Victor from consummating the
marriage with his bride the two men go

136
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:54.189
off to use his creativity and become the
same-sex parents of a monster

137
00:10:54.189 --> 00:11:00.019
Frankenstein the bringer of life and
Pretorius the nurturer the Frankenstein

138
00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:03.110
is reluctant to admit it
the thought of creating life with

139
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.449
Pretorius and thereby stifling the
female necessity inherent in the process

140
00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:13.339
inspires him Welles decision to cast to
known bisexual actors in the roles only

141
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:18.380
furthers the queer reading film
historian David scales said there is an

142
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.149
overriding fantasy of male male
procreation there is the persistent

143
00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:27.649
undercurrent of men creating life
without women the original cut of Bride

144
00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:31.100
of Frankenstein was actually 15 minutes
longer than the one we have now which

145
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.620
sits at just over an hour long that's
because the ending was drastically

146
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.730
edited and changed the reason for this
was that it conflicted with the Hayes

147
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.250
production code the era's version of the
MPAA what went against the code well it

148
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.000
was originally made obvious that the
heart of the monsters bride was taken

149
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.290
from Frankenstein's wife Elizabeth this
would imply the Frankenstein in

150
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.220
Pretorius is mutual goal was predicated
on the destruction of Frankenstein's

151
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.630
heterosexual relationship that he
literally sacrificed Elizabeth for the

152
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.800
realization of his other ambitions
effectively he would have chosen a

153
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.319
homosexual partnership over marriage and
since gay anything was a big no-no for

154
00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:17.660
the Hays Code that had to be cut down
instead Elizabeth is actually present

155
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.170
for the ending and escapes the
destruction of the lab along with dr.

156
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:26.390
Frankenstein while the monster
would be bride and the overtly queer

157
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.950
coded dr. Pretorius are left to perish
gotta let that breeding pair escape

158
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.360
right the very next year in 1936
Universal Pictures released a sequel to

159
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.620
1931 s Dracula entitled Dracula's
daughter a film that featured an

160
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.880
obviously lesbian antagonist and
countess maria zalewska the titular

161
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.860
Dracula's daughter lesbian vampires have
been a staple of the genre since 1872 s

162
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.260
novella Carmilla which predated Dracula
by almost three decades but this was the

163
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.010
first time that it was being shown on
film the lesbian elements were so

164
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.160
obvious that the Hays production code
office actually demanded changes be made

165
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.480
to the script before the movie even went
into production the scene that caused

166
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.839
the biggest issues was between the
countess and model

167
00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:23.500
Lily Warren you
[Music]

168
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:30.100
stand by the fire for a moment mustn't
catch cold

169
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:37.890
[Music]
are you looking at me that way

170
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:44.209
when I do
yeah sure do very well indeed do you

171
00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:51.999
like Jules Lily he's very old and very
beautiful for show to you

172
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.480
I don't think I'll pass tonight I think
I'll go if you don't mind

173
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:11.089
[Music]
production code enforcer Joseph green

174
00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:16.550
wrote to the producers this will need
very careful handling to avoid any

175
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.860
questionable flavor the whole sequence
will be treated in such a way as to

176
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.809
avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual
desire on the part of Maria or of an

177
00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:32.569
attempted sexual attack by her upon
delay Universal played up the lesbian

178
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:35.569
angle in the advertising for the film
though with posters for it declaring

179
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:40.670
save the women of London from Dracula's
daughter some critics of the day picked

180
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.569
up on the lesbian content and tore the
film apart for it the New York world

181
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:49.910
telegram angrily noted the countess's
tendency to wander around giving the eye

182
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:56.149
to sweet young girls further gay subtext
can be gleamed from 1941 s The Wolfman

183
00:14:56.149 --> 00:15:01.220
the idea of being a normal man by day
and then a deviant at night was one that

184
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.040
clung to the identities of a lot of gay
men at the time and now and you know

185
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.179
kind of birth furries so as you can see
classic horror represented the queer

186
00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:15.379
experience whether the initial authors
intended it to or not the sense of

187
00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:21.110
hiding being rejected and doomed to
never know true love of being looked at

188
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.369
as a monster in the eyes of the public
even if you've never done anything to

189
00:15:25.369 --> 00:15:31.040
hurt them the monster coming for your
children the mad scientist going against

190
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.279
nature the beast unable to control its
own urges the creature born against

191
00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:44.899
God's will that's what being gay was and
to some extent still is and so we

192
00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:49.999
identified with the monsters not so much
the heroes but we wouldn't be the

193
00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:55.220
monsters forever in a time when the gay
community was being ravaged by AIDS a

194
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.429
blood-borne disease not entirely
separated from the plague bringing

195
00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:05.749
vampire birth by Bram Stoker Hollywood
would unbeknownst to itself make us the

196
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:07.990
hero

197
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:19.670
American horror movies went through a
revolution of sorts during the 1950s 60s

198
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:25.759
and 70s shifting to more sci-fi than
horror aliens from other worlds and

199
00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:29.500
creatures born of nuclear fallout
peppered cinemas across the country

200
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.610
movies about the horrors of the nuclear
bombs such as Godzilla were easy enough

201
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.290
to figure out there wasn't a whole lot
of subtext to Godzilla being a byproduct

202
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.060
of the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki the sci-fi and Alien movies

203
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.100
were a bit more cleverly coded though
although never clearly stated aliens

204
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.189
were communists they were the Russians
the Chinese the Cubans or Vietnamese

205
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:59.269
they were infiltrating the wholesomeness
of America and preparing to destroy it

206
00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:04.520
from within they represented the other
the unamerican which for conservatives

207
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.929
at the time meant a whole lot more than
just communists it also meant civil

208
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:14.720
rights leaders women's rights activists
and homosexuals invasion of the body

209
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.720
snatchers the thing from the other world
and even plan 9 from outer space

210
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.610
directed by the infamous leak we read
would are just some examples of such

211
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.309
films after the Vietnam War horror began
to take a more inward look at America

212
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:31.909
movies like psycho which I'll talk more
about in part 3 Night of the Living Dead

213
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:35.990
and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre looked
at the horror that already existed in

214
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.340
America the homegrown evils Night of the
Living Dead for instance was a barely

215
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.780
veiled allegory for the burgeoning
American right wing the racists and

216
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.830
bigots refusing to pass on even
returning from the dead the

217
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:54.549
introspection of horror and the 60s and
70s made a lot of people in America very

218
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:59.929
uncomfortable the horror was no longer
coming from without but from within tobe

219
00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:03.559
Hooper's Texas Chainsaw and Wes Craven's
The Hills Have Eyes The Last House on

220
00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:08.179
the Left
all showing how normal Americans can

221
00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:13.340
turn how they could easily become
corrupted evil willing to kill their own

222
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.610
countrymen then in the late 70s and
early 80's a new form of horror arrived

223
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.190
in America
one that at least at first seemed to

224
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:30.610
leave good Christian Americans alone
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids

225
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.890
on June 5th 1981 the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention reported clusters

226
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.240
of pneumonia among gay men in New York
in Los Angeles over the next 18 months

227
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.440
otherwise healthy men of a certain
sexual persuasion began dropping dead

228
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.779
into every major city in the country
the CDC initially called this grid

229
00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:53.649
gay-related immune deficiency
it wasn't until August of 1982 that it

230
00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:58.120
was officially named AIDS it would be
another two years before the cause of

231
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.559
the syndrome a retrovirus called the
human immunodeficiency virus was

232
00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:06.789
discovered in the meantime political
pundits across the country on both the

233
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:10.090
right and left declared that AIDS was a
moral punishment since the vast majority

234
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.990
of people affected at first were gay men
they proclaimed that the disease was

235
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.610
God's Way of punishing the sinners that
only the truly righteous would escape

236
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:23.320
the plague believe it or not a lot of
priests mostly televangelists would

237
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.299
actually charge parishioners a fee to
guarantee that they wouldn't get the

238
00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:35.320
disease their reasoning for it was that
well you might have come in contact with

239
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.549
someone with it and even just being a
near one of those sinners was enough for

240
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:42.700
God to kill you
because that's what Jesus would do as

241
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.750
half of America panicked over AIDS and
the other half welcomed it as a biblical

242
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.639
cleansing or at best ignored its
existence a new trend had developed in

243
00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:56.350
American horror movies the teenage
slasher the slasher movie grew out of

244
00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.460
the fear of your fellow Americans onra
namely the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and

245
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.950
really found its place in pop culture
with the 1978 release of Halloween john

246
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.850
carpenter's masterpiece jump-started the
slasher genre and also created a

247
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.440
template that in the time of AIDS would
become the most prevalent theme in

248
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:21.700
horror namely the virgin lives basically
every slasher movie in the late 70s and

249
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.870
early 80's followed this format
exemplified by the Friday the 13th

250
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.789
series in which camp counselors are
murdered literally for having sex you

251
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:34.540
see a pair of counselors were off doing
the dirty when Jason Voorhees

252
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.130
developmentally challenged camper was
swimming when he began to drown they

253
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.860
weren't there to save him because they
were having sex his mother then kills

254
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.730
the counselors in question and when the
camp reopens many years later she

255
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.290
returns to exact her vengeance on a new
generation of horny teenagers then she

256
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.080
gets her head cut off and Jason all
grown up comes to kill the counselors

257
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.440
who killed his mom the ones who didn't
let him drown see apparently Jason

258
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.550
survived the drowning and has been
living in the woods around Crystal Lake

259
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:12.160
ever since like two decades and has
never told anyone that he was alive

260
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.580
never tried to find his mother just kind
of built a house for himself out there

261
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.450
and yet the logic doesn't really add up
suffice it to say the moral of the

262
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.430
Friday the 13th series was have sex and
get a machete to the head this became

263
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.450
Ober obvious once aids became widely
known it wasn't just a moral issue to

264
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.600
not have sex before marriage it was a
life-or-death one at least for the

265
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.890
people who didn't assume that only gays
got AIDS

266
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:44.290
then came Wes Craven's seminal work a
Nightmare on Elm Street telling the

267
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.550
story of teenager Nancy Thompson as she
is stalked by a killer that can murder

268
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.790
you in your dreams
a nitron Elm Street continued to play

269
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.050
into the fear your fellow Americans
genre Freddy Krueger the killer was once

270
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.280
upon a time just another man working in
the town of Springwood but eventually it

271
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.880
was discovered that he was a child
killer and later confirmed in the series

272
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.290
a child molester when his murder trial
ended in a mistrial due to the police

273
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.490
failing to get the proper search warrant
the parents in Springwood exact advisee

274
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:17.200
lanty justice against Krueger burning
him alive but Freddy didn't stay dead

275
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.160
and returned to Springwood as a dream
demon hunting down the children of those

276
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.910
who had killed him Nancy was one of
those children at the end of the movie

277
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.640
Krueger is defeated and Nancy lives
happily ever after

278
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.420
except for attacked on stinger ending
that Wes Craven hated until the day he

279
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.230
died less than a year later now without
the involvement of Wes Craven and

280
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.180
Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's
revenge was released the most

281
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.250
inadvertently gay horror movie ever made

282
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:52.110
[Music]
no that's not the gayest part gayer

283
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.770
something is trying to get inside my
body gayer

284
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.839
[Music]

285
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:17.770
[Music]
a leather bar and the director to this

286
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.960
day says that he didn't realize how gay
the movie was when he was making it

287
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.960
Freddy's revenge breaks with the
traditional formula of the slasher movie

288
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.790
by having the main character be a male
jesse definitely an interesting move in

289
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:37.600
1985 but one that just doesn't quite
work Jesse's family has recently moved

290
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.930
to spring wood quints identity into the
house that Nancy lived in in part one

291
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.590
shortly after moving into the house
Jesse begins to have nightmares that he

292
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.530
soon discovers are eerily similar to the
ones the houses former occupant had

293
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.580
finally Jesse meets Freddy directly in a
dream and spends the rest of the movie

294
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.750
trying to stay awake and convince people
that he's possessed by the child killer

295
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.920
Freddy is defeated in the end of course
but not until the movie has completely

296
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.059
subverted the slasher genre by turning
Jesse and not his would-be girlfriend

297
00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:11.980
Lisa into the damsel in distress in fact
the movie ends with Lisa needing to come

298
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:17.620
to Jesse's rescue jesse is quite
obviously put in the female role in the

299
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.470
movie the gayness of the film was
immediately picked up by the queer

300
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.420
audience and even became a favorite to
have on TVs and gay bars in the late 80s

301
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.540
besides the leather bar scene and
honestly how could you not tell that

302
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.780
that scene was gay these are the same
people who thought freddy mercury was

303
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.040
the epitome of masculinity there are
plenty of other obvious nods to Jesse

304
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.630
being gay when Jesse and Lisa come
closest to actually having sex he panics

305
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.220
and runs away because there's another
man's tongue in his mouth so he runs to

306
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.900
the house of his male friend Grady where
he proclaims something is trying to get

307
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:55.450
inside my body and Grady replies and you
want to sleep with me remember they had

308
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.870
no idea that this was gay well that's
not entirely true

309
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.610
the film screenwriter David Chaston was
gay and purposely wrote gay subtext into

310
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:08.140
the film though he denied it for years
he eventually admitted that homophobia

311
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.540
was skyrocketing
and I began to think about our core

312
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.650
audience adolescent boys and how all of
this stuff might be trickling down into

313
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.179
their psyches my thought was that
tapping into the angst would give an

314
00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:23.590
extra edge to the horror the actor
portraying Jesse Mark Patton has stated

315
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.190
that the film put the brakes on his
career in Hollywood after playing a gay

316
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.620
teenager and
1982's come back to the five-and-dime

317
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.280
Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean and then playing
an obviously coded gay character in

318
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.780
Freddy's revenge Patton believes that he
was typecast as gay effectively killing

319
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.559
his career at a time when conservatism
was flourishing in America and gay

320
00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:46.240
equaled AIDS Patton actually retired
from acting after the release of

321
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.039
Freddy's revenge becoming an interior
designer in 2010 Robert Englund Freddie

322
00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:55.330
himself said of the movie the second
Nightmare on Elm Street is obviously

323
00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:00.100
intended as a bisexual themed film it
was the early 80s Jesse's wrestling with

324
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.320
whether to come out or not and his own
sexual desire was manifested by Freddy

325
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.679
his friend is the object of his
affection that's all there in the film a

326
00:26:08.679 --> 00:26:11.940
Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's
revenge has become a cult classic

327
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.669
especially in the gay community and
although gay characters wouldn't appear

328
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:19.720
in any nightmare films going forward it
did remain an oddly inclusive slasher

329
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.190
franchise but before the decade of the
1980s ended another movie would whet the

330
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:30.640
appetite of gay horror fans The Lost
Boys released in 1987 is basically a

331
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:36.970
helix Studios movie with a bit more of a
budget and a lot less sex after moving

332
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.940
to the town of Santa Clara our
protagonist Michael falls in with a

333
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:45.429
crowd of typical 1980s bad boys who
happened to be vampires because he has a

334
00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:51.220
crush on the one girl in the group star
even though none of the other guys in

335
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.850
the group show any interest in her
whatsoever Michael decides it must be

336
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:59.710
because they all have vampire
girlfriends of their own exactly soon

337
00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.850
Michael needs to head vampire of the
group David who tricks Michael into

338
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:09.429
drinking some of his bodily fluids blood
obviously they're vampires what else

339
00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:12.850
could it possibly be it doesn't take
long for star to completely disappear

340
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.630
from the story except for a forced sex
scene that I'm convinced was a request

341
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.950
by the producers and Michael starts
donning the vampire cruise trademark

342
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:26.200
single earring gay history lesson in the
1950s 60s and 70s gay men would get one

343
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.130
of their ears pierced to show other gay
men that they were available for sex

344
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:35.760
when they were in cruising areas but
they would get their right ear pierced

345
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:42.060
and all the guys in this movie have
their left ear pierced so completely

346
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.300
different obviously completely different
not the same at all completely different

347
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:51.270
and what is with that poster of Rob Lowe
on the closet door would any straight

348
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.490
teenager have that on their wall
really

349
00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:04.570
and this shot I don't know I was an only
child but I don't think brothers get

350
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.979
quite this close but maybe I'm wrong
maybe all those stepbrother videos that

351
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:13.119
I've totally haven't watched online are
way more factual than I thought also

352
00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:18.759
single ear piercing as a horror movie
The Lost Boys isn't exactly scary but it

353
00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:21.999
definitely kick-started a lot of gay
kids into puberty there's also the

354
00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:25.779
underlying connection to the AIDS
epidemic the movie was released at the

355
00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:30.279
height of the epidemic in 1987 and the
presence of a monstrous disease in this

356
00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:35.229
case vampirism spread by bodily fluids
was not lost on the film's director out

357
00:28:35.229 --> 00:28:39.700
gay filmmaker Joel Schumacher who a
decade later would become famous for

358
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.619
codpieces and bat nipples that same year
Friday the 13th part 7 a new blood was

359
00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:49.359
released which in and of itself isn't
very gay but had a shocking amount of

360
00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:53.440
okay cast members especially for the
time including the main characters love

361
00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:06.909
interest yeah a bunch of us got together
to throw my cousin Michael surprise

362
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:13.899
birthday party I came over to invite
your daughter oh the burning passion the

363
00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:18.339
90s was pretty much a dead zone for gay
horror but in 2005 we got the first

364
00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:22.929
truly gay horror movie with hell-bent
there's no subtext here this is as gay

365
00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:26.409
as horror gets the majority of the movie
takes place in West Hollywood Halloween

366
00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:33.039
party for God's sake and the movie well
the movies ridiculous but in a good way

367
00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:36.309
most of the characters are more
preoccupied with getting laid than the

368
00:29:36.309 --> 00:29:39.279
killings that are actually going on
around them which admittedly is a

369
00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:43.599
convention of the slasher genre but for
some reason in hell-bent it feels even

370
00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:47.139
more silly than usual oh there's a
crazed killer out there murdering my

371
00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:49.209
friends I need a hookup as soon as
possible

372
00:29:49.209 --> 00:29:53.559
one thing I can say for the movie though
is that although it was made in the

373
00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:59.499
early 2000s it actually feels like a mid
80s classic slasher movie it ignores the

374
00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:04.529
more polished aesthetic of horror movies
at the time for a more grainy retro feel

375
00:30:04.529 --> 00:30:09.549
it was likely just a byproduct of having
such a low budget but I definitely count

376
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:14.050
it in the movie's favor
the next year in 2006 we got the

377
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.700
Covenant featuring an almost entirely
all-male cast with female characters

378
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.510
appearing mostly as out-of-focus figures
in the background the Covenant follows

379
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.370
the story of a group of male witches who
are all about to turn 18 at which point

380
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:32.470
they will ascend meaning they will
access their true powers the leader of

381
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:38.080
the group caleb is obsessively targeted
by the new guy in school chase you're

382
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.980
right they do sound like Sean Cody
models by the way chase is played by

383
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.210
Sebastian Stan aka the Winter Soldier
aka Bucky Barnes aka Captain America's

384
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:50.380
one true love Stuckey AAF anyway back to
the plot it turns out the chase is also

385
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.590
a witch and some nasty supernatural
occurrences start happening around town

386
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.250
once he gets there which puts caleb on
edge we eventually learned that Chase is

387
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.970
behind it all and that he wants to
consume the other witch's magic to make

388
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:06.790
himself more powerful he wants their
essences inside of him in the climactic

389
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.480
fight scene the two witches hurl liquidy
globs of opaque magic at each other in

390
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.230
the rain eventually chase is defeated
and caleb drives off with a girl there's

391
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.040
also this scene

392
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.220
[Music]

393
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:40.200
and this one just you know brother but
this movie is totally straight guys

394
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.620
there's nothing gay about it
nothing it doesn't even have a gay

395
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.520
director or writer like Freddy's revenge
or The Lost Boys I mean it was made by

396
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.990
Renny Harlin director of the long kiss
good night and die hard 2 and also

397
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.260
Nightmare on Elm Street part 4 the only
reason I can figure that this movie is

398
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.830
so damn homoerotic is that the producers
were trying to make a movie aimed at

399
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.640
teenage girls and that this was right
around the time that the Harry Draco

400
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.049
slash fiction really started to take off
now before I bring this video to a close

401
00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:14.100
I'd like to mention a movie that I
watched and you shouldn't in doing my

402
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.030
research for this I was told over and
over again to watch the movie 1313

403
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:24.090
haunted frat from 2011 and I did
basically a frat house filled with boys

404
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.049
walking around the grandpa's white
underwear is being haunted by a crazy

405
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:32.549
woman who possesses them that's it
there's no end of the story there's no

406
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:36.720
story there's barely a plot there's less
acting talent than in a typical porn

407
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.040
shoot and I don't know what the hell
this is to be honest this scene here

408
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.730
this goes on for 15 minutes he walks
around the house like this for 15

409
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:52.470
minutes in this shower scene 8 minutes
in this random ass scene of proto Zac

410
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.460
Efron touching himself 7 minutes the
bulk of the movies 1 hour and 15 minute

411
00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.150
runtime is made up of scenes like this
the other five or so minutes are made up

412
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.970
of this guy trying to get his frat
brothers to help him write a history of

413
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.030
the frat and discovering that it was
built on the site of a destroyed mental

414
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.270
institution I was convinced that I was
watching a porno that had all the sex

415
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:14.850
cut out honestly I mean the acting the
directing the blocking they're all poor

416
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.750
no quality no no that's mean the
blocking is actually much worse than it

417
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.600
is in a porno now that you've been
warned off of ever watching this

418
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.730
disaster of a photo play I'll do the
actual ending to the video throughout

419
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:30.870
the 20th century and early into the 21st
gayness has remained coated in horror

420
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.830
movies
with some minor very nice exceptions

421
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:40.080
Jesse from a knight Ron Elm Street -
isn't gay but he's gay the boys from the

422
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.379
Lost Boys and the Covenant aren't gay
but they're gay actual gay characters

423
00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:50.190
did show up in some movies like David in
the Bride of Chucky Lewis and American

424
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:54.509
Psycho and Tom and scream 3 Robbie and
scream 4 but they were all supporting

425
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:59.190
characters with no real arc and not a
whole lot to do in the story like every

426
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.549
other genre in Hollywood the LGBT
community has mostly been left out of

427
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:06.539
horror movies unless we're in a doomed
love affair a la Brokeback Mountain or

428
00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:11.159
doomed to die in general like in milk or
boys don't cry LGBT characters don't get

429
00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:15.270
a whole lot of attention considering how
niche the horror genre is it's kind of

430
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.929
amazing that we've gotten as much
mainstream attention as we have even

431
00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:23.490
when it's as coated as it is it's
usually pretty hidden but if we look

432
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:27.599
hard enough we can find ourselves in
these movies sometimes we don't have to

433
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:32.069
look that hard at all but there is one
instance in which Hollywood has been

434
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:37.050
more than happy to betray the LGBT
community in both horror and mainstream

435
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.210
movies it's not a new trend in fact it's
been around long before the gay rights

436
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.849
movement brought us into public light we
can always be the main draw for a movie

437
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:55.530
if we're the killer James Miller will
serve 10 years probation after killing

438
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.280
his neighbor in East Austin the defense
argued Miller stabbed his neighbor when

439
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.960
Spencer allegedly came on to him the
prosecution argued blood evidence didn't

440
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.190
match Miller story the jury agreed with
the defensive stance that he serves no

441
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.670
threat to the community
Miller's defense is also known as the

442
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.950
gay panic defense and while it's a rare
defense it is legal in most states the

443
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:21.420
gay panic defense is a legal tactic used
by people who have usually been accused

444
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.130
of murder the defendant accuses the
victim of being gay and having

445
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:30.030
approached them sexually
they claimed that they find the same-sex

446
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.330
advances so offensive and frightening
that it brings on a psychotic state

447
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.970
characterized by unusual violence the
first known use of this defense was in

448
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.620
1954 when a flight attendant named
William Simpson was murdered by two men

449
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:49.470
Charles Lorenz and Richard killin in
Miami Florida the two men had been

450
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.700
posing as hitchhikers and robbing people
who picked them up they'd been doing

451
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.590
this for months but instead of robbing
Simpson they realized that he was gay

452
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.510
and murdered him the two men were
convicted of manslaughter instead of

453
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:08.190
first-degree murder after Simpson was
characterized as a pervert during the

454
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:12.900
trial the gay panic defense has been
used to successfully limit the sentences

455
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.690
of or altogether acquit murderers of
LGBT people in America

456
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:25.110
ever since gay panic because there is
nothing scarier than a queer person and

457
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:30.260
for a long time Hollywood agreed

458
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:39.480
[Music]
members of the LGBTQ community have been

459
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.620
used as villains by Hollywood since
before film had sound if I tried to dive

460
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.090
into every movie with a gay bi lesbian
or transgender villain this video would

461
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:53.040
never get finished so I'm going to focus
on a few prominent films that really

462
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.070
grabbed the public's attention starting
in 1948 with Alfred Hitchcock's rope

463
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.040
adapted from the play of the same name
which itself was based on the true story

464
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:08.430
of Leopold and Loeb a gay couple who in
1924 murdered a 14 year old boy just to

465
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.480
see if they could get away with it
spoiler alert they don't rope follows

466
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.400
Brandon and Phillip two college students
who murder one of their classmates as an

467
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.770
intellectual exercise they want to prove
their superiority over the common man by

468
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.700
committing the perfect murder the sexual
tension between Brandon and Phillip is

469
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:39.000
obvious to anyone with functioning eyes
and ears how did you feel during it very

470
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.720
much anything

471
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:48.480
till his body went limp and I knew it
was over

472
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:58.579
and then then I felt tremendously
exhilarated how did you feel

473
00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:03.720
Hitchcock in fact wanted to see how far
he could push the American rating system

474
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.559
with the film the couple's interaction
is so intense at times that has been

475
00:38:07.559 --> 00:38:11.249
compared to watching a sex scene to
maintain that Hitchcock actually shot

476
00:38:11.249 --> 00:38:16.920
the film so that it appears to be one
long 80 minute take he did this so that

477
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.210
once the film was put before the Hays
Code was then rating his board they

478
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:26.549
wouldn't be able to really force him to
edit any of the movie out sexual tension

479
00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:31.920
or not without destroying the artistic
value of the film it's a pretty clever

480
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.180
move really Jimmy Stewart plays Rupert
in the movie the couples professor and

481
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.559
joins them for a dinner party the table
of which has been set over a chest

482
00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:44.579
containing their victim's body
it's alluded to several times in the

483
00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:48.569
film that he is more than just their
professor and that he has had a sexual

484
00:38:48.569 --> 00:38:53.309
relationship with one if not both of our
murderers rope is one of Hitchcock's

485
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:57.930
least successful films at the box-office
its financial failure being attributed

486
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.230
to the gay undertones
it also perpetuated two damaging

487
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:06.059
stereotypes of gay men that of the
dangerous if not psychotic homosexual

488
00:39:06.059 --> 00:39:09.720
and that of the gay man who thinks he's
better than everyone else

489
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.549
the superior Brandon and Phillips
assumption that they could get away with

490
00:39:14.549 --> 00:39:19.829
murder even with the victims corpse in
the same room as a dinner party shows

491
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:24.180
their belief that homosexuals are
superior to heterosexuals this was a

492
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.460
belief amongst straight people at the
time it was a sort of ooh those gays

493
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.619
think they're better than us it was
especially prevalent in England I guess

494
00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:37.610
they were still sore over the whole
Oscar Wilde thing

495
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.980
rope wouldn't be the last time Hitchcock
dealt with the LGBT community though he

496
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:48.770
did so again in possibly his most famous
film it was the beginning of the 1960s

497
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:55.430
following a decade of pure Americana
suburbs white picket fences and I Love

498
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:59.240
Lucy a time where every white man had a
job

499
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.920
women cooked dinner and even married
couples couldn't be shown sleeping in

500
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.790
the same bed together on TV a clean
proper image was paramount with men in

501
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:17.030
suits and women dressed smartly and
skirts and blouses hair quaffed pearls

502
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:22.600
at the neck the horrors of World War 2
in the upheaval of the 1960s and 70s

503
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:28.220
seemed a world away in either direction
and into this period of safe white-bread

504
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:34.480
suburban heteronormativity came Alfred
Hitchcock's Psycho

505
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.850
you

506
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.150
the film tells the story of Marion crane
a secretary that absconds with $40,000

507
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:14.750
from her employer her stay at the
secluded Bates Motel and the aftermath

508
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.680
psycho is famous for two things killing
its main character halfway through the

509
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.500
movie and the most memorable shower
scene this side of the ex rating the

510
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.950
Marion crane isn't the character that
people walk away from psycho talking

511
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:34.650
about its Norman Bates the manager of
the Bates Motel and his extremely

512
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:39.840
unhealthy relationship with his mother a
boy's best friend is his mother

513
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.400
corta the theme of psycho is that a
seemingly normal person can harbor many

514
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.820
secrets Marion's unhappiness with her
life

515
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:53.690
Norman's deeply disturbed nature both
are well hidden from the outside world

516
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:59.580
until they're not Marion meets Norman
when escaping from her boring unhappy

517
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:05.160
life a thin but attractive man Norman is
courteous and kind to Marion as he

518
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.270
checks her into the motel although he
shows some odd tendencies such as his

519
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.140
connection with his domineering mother
Norman spends most of the film as a

520
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.820
sympathetic figure due mostly to his
portrayal by Anthony Perkins himself a

521
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:22.170
gay actor Hitchcock was actually aware
of perkins homosexuality when he cast

522
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:27.930
him as Norman Bates although he wasn't
out because it was the 60s it was well

523
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.440
known around Hollywood or at least
rumored that Perkins had dated Tab

524
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.730
Hunter a 1950s heartthrob so when it's
revealed at the end of the movie that

525
00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:40.140
Norman is not only the killer but also
has multiple personalities the other

526
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.550
personality being that of his now
revealed to be dead mother it was a

527
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.450
shock to audiences and although it's
more than obvious that Norman is a

528
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.350
madman many people walked away from
psycho looking at Norman as an example

529
00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.600
of that horrifying group of people they
hear about in the cities those

530
00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.869
homosexuals and transvestites a fear
that Hollywood spent the next two

531
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:06.570
decades perpetuating with movies like
the Detective vanishing point freebie in

532
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.410
the beam and dressed to kill but
Hollywood's fear-mongering of the LGBT

533
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:15.540
community would soon turn deadly
with the 1980 release of cruising in the

534
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.170
sweltering heat
in New York summer severed body parts of

535
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.950
murdered gay men are appearing in the
Hudson River because of his resemblance

536
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:27.569
to the victims the NYPD puts Officer
Steve Burns played by Al Pacino on the

537
00:43:27.569 --> 00:43:32.099
case so Al Pacino moves to the gay area
of town goes to a few leather bars makes

538
00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:35.640
friends with a gay guy and spends most
of the movie ignoring his wife while

539
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.210
hunting down the mystery killer who
spends the movie killing gay men

540
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.250
eventually it's revealed that the killer
is himself a gay man with schizophrenia

541
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.940
he's arrested but then the gay guy Al
Pacino had become friends with turns up

542
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.180
dead and the movie ends with a not so
subtle hint that Al Pacino may have been

543
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.410
the killer all along
cruisin was not well-received by gay

544
00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.220
audiences even while it was being filmed
there were protests following the

545
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.510
production the protests were initially
started by Arthur Bell a gay journalist

546
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.500
who wrote a series of articles on which
the film was actually based protesters

547
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.099
would play loud music near the
production let off air horns and chant

548
00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:15.569
disrupting the audio recording they'd
also point large mirrors down on the

549
00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:18.510
production from the top of buildings in
order to mess with the lighting of

550
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:23.640
outdoor shots once production wrapped
the MPAA saddled the film with an nc-17

551
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:29.010
rating forcing director William Friedkin
who also directed 1970s at very gay the

552
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.329
boys in the band to cut 40 minutes from
the film in order to secure an R rating

553
00:44:33.329 --> 00:44:37.170
upon release the LGBT community
continued to protest the film many

554
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.440
claiming that its portrayal of the gay
community as a sex-crazed group of

555
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.700
sodomites would destroy any goodwill
that the community had developed not to

556
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.140
mention the gay killer which was playing
into the already developed fear of the

557
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:55.829
LGBT community then in April of 1980 two
months after the release of the film one

558
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:58.730
of the bars featured in the movie was
attacked

559
00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:04.790
a lone gunman armed with a submachine
gun entered the bar and emptied two

560
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:11.210
clips into the crowd before being
stopped 12 people were injured and two

561
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.109
lost their lives throughout the summer
of 1980 there were several attacks on

562
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:19.010
gay men in the United States with the
attackers all pointing out that they had

563
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:25.190
seen cruising and that it inspired them
after cruising failed to recoup its

564
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.609
budget at the box office in the toxic
reaction toward the film Hollywood

565
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:32.900
started to reduce the amount of gay
villains and movies but transgender

566
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:38.150
characters were still open for
exploitation 1983's sleepaway camp one

567
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:42.890
of a dozen or so Friday the 13th ripoffs
opened on to children Angela and Peter

568
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:48.830
voting on a lake with her father and his
boyfriend okay cool

569
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:53.480
but there's an accident and one of the
children dies eight years later we find

570
00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.350
out that Peter was the child who died
and Angela now being raised by her aunt

571
00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:02.359
martha has become extremely introverted
she along with some relatives go to the

572
00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:06.530
camp near the lake where the accident
occurred and in Friday the 13th ripoff

573
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.630
style people start turning up dead but
the big twist in the end isn't that it

574
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:16.940
was Jason's mom killing people all along
instead we find out that Peter didn't

575
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.260
die in the accident it was actually
Angela who died and once their Aunt

576
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:27.850
Martha got custody from their gay dad
she began raising Peter as Angela why

577
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:41.960
you see I always say water under the
bridge but it certainly will be a nice

578
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:47.069
little surprise when Richard comes home
to find a little girl in the house yes

579
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:53.190
I've always dreamed of a little girl
just like you I mean we already have a

580
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:59.599
boy so another one simply would not do
Oh No absolutely not

581
00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:05.609
so as Angela / Peter transgender no the
character is disturbed and suffers from

582
00:47:05.609 --> 00:47:10.589
a particularly traumatic case of PTSD
but they're not transgender though

583
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:15.239
audiences took Angela / Peter as a
transgender character which further fed

584
00:47:15.239 --> 00:47:19.579
into the public assumption that
transgender people were sick depraved

585
00:47:19.579 --> 00:47:24.719
and likely homicidal a fear that would
reach a breaking point

586
00:47:24.719 --> 00:47:30.569
in 1991 released on Valentine's Day
Silence of the Lambs adapted from the

587
00:47:30.569 --> 00:47:35.249
novel by Thomas Harris tells the story
of Clarice Starling a young FBI trainee

588
00:47:35.249 --> 00:47:39.630
who finds herself in the middle of the
biggest manhunt in the country there's a

589
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:46.009
man killing and skinning women a man the
press has started calling Buffalo Bill

590
00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:50.269
Clarice enlists the help of famed
psychiatrist and infamous murderer

591
00:47:50.269 --> 00:47:55.769
Hannibal the cannibal Lecter to help her
track down Buffalo Bill who was a former

592
00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:59.640
patient of his before Hannibal was
locked up Clarice tracks down the

593
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:05.819
psychotic killer rescues his final
victim and kills him in self-defense to

594
00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:09.809
bring you a special report Silence of
the Lambs is actually the first movie to

595
00:48:09.809 --> 00:48:13.619
be labeled a psychological thriller it
was a horror movie when it first came

596
00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:18.599
out and was even called that by the
director but a year later when it got

597
00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:22.670
the Best Picture nomination at the
Oscars and then eventually won the

598
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:27.719
Academy and members of the Academy
started calling it a psychological

599
00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:33.180
thriller instead of a horror movie
because they didn't like the idea of the

600
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:39.660
Academy's biggest award Best Picture
going to a horror movie

601
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:45.900
and so the term psychological thriller
was born in both the novel and film

602
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.880
Buffalo Bill whose real name is Jamie
Gumb is portrayed as something close to

603
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.339
a transgender person at least on the
surface he appears to want to be a woman

604
00:48:56.339 --> 00:49:01.289
creating a bodysuit out of the flesh of
his victims but as it stated in both the

605
00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:07.650
film and book he is not transgender
Hannibal Lecter says belly is not a real

606
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.720
transsexual but he thinks he is he tries
to be he's tried to be a lot of things I

607
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.329
expect gum is certainly a deranged
character and is in the very least

608
00:49:18.329 --> 00:49:22.950
bisexual having been in a relationship
with one of Hannibal's male patients as

609
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:27.210
well as women in the past but his
identity as a transgender character is

610
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:32.130
far more questionable he has a
self-loathing that is well beyond

611
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:37.039
anything typical his own self-hatred
drives him to want to be something else

612
00:49:37.039 --> 00:49:42.000
anything else than what he actually is
although he's likely more gay than

613
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.440
bisexual he has an obsession with women
stemming from his mother abandoning him

614
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:52.020
as a child he would eventually find out
that she was an alcoholic prostitute but

615
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.609
went on to create a beauty queen image
of his mother in his head the perfect

616
00:49:56.609 --> 00:50:03.029
woman a woman that anyone would want to
be including him Buffalo Bill was not a

617
00:50:03.029 --> 00:50:09.150
transgender individual but as Lecter
said he wanted to be he applied for

618
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:13.260
gender reassignment surgery at multiple
hospitals but was universally declined

619
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:18.260
because of his mental state
despite what Republicans think you can't

620
00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:23.150
just get a sex change there's a massive
amount of psychological testing before

621
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.570
doctors will move forward with the
procedure especially in the case of male

622
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.880
to female gender confirmation so when
bill was denied this procedure he

623
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:37.850
decided to make himself into a woman any
way he could there was massive backlash

624
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.990
against the film upon release as the
LGBT community accused the movie of both

625
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:47.360
transphobia and homophobia the director
Jonathan Demi did his best to defend the

626
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:53.200
film but most people still look at it as
a piece of overtly anti LGBT cinema

627
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.940
although it was stated very clearly that
from a psychological perspective Buffalo

628
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:04.970
Bill is not a transgender person it's
still a thorny situation Bill's gender

629
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:09.200
identity is only commented on by
cisgender people in the book and film

630
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.790
and so cisgender people are in essence
deciding whether or not a person is

631
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:18.770
transgender trans activists argued that
if Buffalo Bill thinks he is

632
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:23.420
transgendered then he is and it's not
the place of the cisgender characters to

633
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:29.030
decide which would mean that bill is a
terrible representation of transgender

634
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:34.070
women who for the most part are very
passive and non violent in fact trans

635
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.910
women are infinitely more likely to be
the victim of a violent crime than the

636
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.530
perpetrator of one and therefore the
argument that Silence of the Lambs is a

637
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:48.890
transphobic film holds some weight
regarding this type of transgender

638
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.390
character in fiction LGBT activist
Savannah Stobbs said

639
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:57.290
transgender women are often represented
as psychotic killers as a lazy method of

640
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:02.000
responding to mainstream society's fear
of gender non-conforming people

641
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.190
this popular trope in film reinforces
the idea that being transgender is

642
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:12.680
unnatural and perverted and pathologize
'as gender fluidity but on the other

643
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.510
hand with Buffalo Bill being so
obviously insane can his own feelings

644
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:23.660
about his gender identity be valid he is
detached from reality and in the book it

645
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:27.230
is stated quite clearly that even if he
had gotten the gender confirmation

646
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:31.460
surgery he would have eventually found a
different reason - at least harm people

647
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:38.599
if not outright ly kill them because he
is psychotic unhinged his gender

648
00:52:38.599 --> 00:52:43.220
identity has nothing to do with that in
the book it is noted by a specialist who

649
00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.930
saw bill about the gender confirmation
surgery that he did not present any of

650
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.710
the characteristics of a transgender
woman furthering the argument in the

651
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:56.930
fiction at least that he is not
transgender and of course Buffalo Bill

652
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.530
is not a real person he is a character
created by an author and then

653
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:05.349
interpreted by filmmakers Thomas Harris
did not write a transgender character

654
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:10.940
but an extremely psychologically
disturbed one a character with a

655
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:17.240
horrifying childhood lifelong emotional
instability and violent tendencies

656
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.020
a psychopathic character that hates
himself so much that he's willing to

657
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:26.450
torture kill and fillet women to be
someone else there could be a debate to

658
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:31.340
be had whether or not Buffalo Bill is a
transgender character but the most

659
00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.540
important thing might be how his
character was perceived by audiences and

660
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:40.310
many audiences did see him as a
transgender character Buffalo Bills

661
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:44.600
presence can still be felt today in
bathroom laws across the United States

662
00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:49.940
and in the fear-mongering of right-wing
conservatives Buffalo Bill has even been

663
00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:54.110
mentioned by fox news commentators when
trying to defend the discriminatory

664
00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:59.300
bathroom laws with some Republicans even
nicknaming North Carolina's bathroom law

665
00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:05.690
HB - the Buffalo Bill so even though
Thomas Harris and Jonathan Demi did not

666
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:10.580
intend for Bill to be a trans character
he is now ingrained in the public

667
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:15.760
consciousness as the worst possible
example of the transgender community

668
00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.690
highly unrealistic one LGBT villains
would remain a staple in Hollywood films

669
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:25.850
for years to come the bisexual Catherine
Tramell in 1992 s Basic Instinct drew

670
00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:30.140
the ire of lesbian and bisexual groups
especially pointing out how bisexuals

671
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.920
had minimal if any representation in
mainstream media and how the biggest

672
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.850
bisexual character was a murderous
narcissistic psychopath but we're

673
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:41.480
cruising which did portray some LGBT
characters as human and sympathetic

674
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.200
failed at the box office
Basic Instinct portrayed a murderous

675
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:50.600
bisexual woman and was box-office gold
taking in three hundred and fifty

676
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.510
million dollars in 1992 that's over half
a billion dollars when you adjusted for

677
00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:00.230
inflation Hollywood brought out the
bisexual villains several more times in

678
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:05.720
the 1990s most notably in the talented
mr. Ripley in 1999 but none of them had

679
00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:10.880
quite as much success as Basic Instinct
so as you can see the LGBT community has

680
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.470
been fodder for Hollywood's villain
machine for almost a century we can be

681
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:19.490
betrayed as the terrifying other the
corrupted city dwellers that the

682
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:22.989
suburban Knights have fled from
but Hollywood itself has strayed away

683
00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:27.729
from portraying gay characters as
villains in more recent years you'd be

684
00:55:27.729 --> 00:55:31.960
hard-pressed to find a Buffalo Bill in a
cinema near you in 2018 in fact there's

685
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.049
another remake of psycho in the works
and they've already said that Norman

686
00:55:35.049 --> 00:55:38.559
will not be dressing as his mother in
this version so things have gotten

687
00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:42.309
better
mainstream media no longer portrays us

688
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:46.719
as monsters teenage girls and their moms
were the biggest audience for this

689
00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:50.920
year's loved Simon
but with glads 2018 survey of LGBT

690
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:55.119
representation and cinema showing that
our percentage of representation on the

691
00:55:55.119 --> 00:56:00.849
big screen is lower now than it has been
in over a decade maybe we need to ask

692
00:56:00.849 --> 00:56:10.469
the question is no representation better
than bad representation

693
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.679
