00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.050
Horror has always been an inherently traditionalistic
genre, since fear is an inherently traditional,

2
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.650
conservative emotion, and horror is often
used for preserving traditional values: the

3
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.080
victory of those who are virtuous, the punishment
of those who are wicked, and rejection of

4
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080
the “other”.

5
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.600
Nevertheless, for centuries, queerness and
horror have been inextricably linked.

6
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.930
With horror relying on queerness for shock
value, and queerness relying on horror for

7
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440
visibility and validation.

8
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
The horror genre we know today has its roots
in the eighteenth-century romance and Gothic

9
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.850
genres, the more gruesome works of Shakespeare,
as well as the works of Dante, which described

10
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.890
in graphic detail the torments of Hell that
await those who sin.

11
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.130
But the arrival of the printing press spurred
a demand for long-format literature.

12
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.620
Enter the Gothic genre, and the growing dominance
of the novel as the go-to English language

13
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.060
prose-fiction format.

14
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640
More demand meant more authors.

15
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.430
More authors meant more voices.

16
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.130
Namely, queer voices.

17
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
However, we would only step into the spotlight
as one of the few great leading roles we were

18
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
allowed to fully inhabit: The Villain.

19
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.640
Queer attraction and subtext could suddenly
be explored in works like Sheridan Le Fanu's

20
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.450
Carmilla, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian
Gray, and Bram Stoker's Dracula, and queer

21
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.530
characters could take a role at the heart
of the story, albeit as predatory monsters

22
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.630
with perverse desires.

23
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.190
LGBT authors discovered that we could operate
within the constraints of this most conservative

24
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.070
genres, utilizing metaphor and coding to depict
our queer culture…

25
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.780
For a while, it was preferable to be seen
as a monster rather than to go unnoticed.

26
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.620
However, in our eagerness to use the genre
to depict some element of ourselves, we most

27
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.310
frequently revealed our self-hatred, the stinging
toxin gay readers were obliged to ingest in

28
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.020
order to fulfill our desire to see ourselves.

29
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.660
Into the early 1900s, through two world wars
and the extremely conformist 1950s and early

30
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.579
1960s, so-called sexual deviation and perversity
continued to play a prominent part in the

31
00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.970
horror genre.

32
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.169
As novels, movies, and television became increasingly
permissive, graphic depictions of passionate

33
00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:01.730
lesbian vampires, pansexual covens, mother-obsessed
maniacs, and cross-dressing cannibals startled

34
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.470
and titilated mainstream audiences... while
infuriating censors, and many in the queer

35
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.770
community alike.

36
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.669
But the anti-hero was becoming a prominent
protagonist now, and the prim, prudish, heterosexual

37
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:20.540
heroes of the past were ridiculed for being
painfully boring, while the bizarre monsters

38
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.490
and murderers were applauded for their defiance
of societal conventions.

39
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.670
Up until then, families were considered a
perfect microcosm of society.

40
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.670
Sacred.

41
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.410
A source of power and security.

42
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.910
The heroes would do whatever was required
to defeat the monster and restore order, including

43
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.440
sacrificing themselves.

44
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.660
But then a transition took place.

45
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.560
We went from 'killing the deviant to save
the family and society' to the insinuation

46
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.010
that family and society was where the deviance
lay, and that they may destroy you.

47
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.840
Rosemary’s Baby, Carrie, The Exorcist, The
Shining, and The Omen.

48
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.730
In these stories, family and society were
where the monsters were made… through divorce,

49
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.479
abuse, or neglect… through isolation and
exclusion, and especially through a disregard

50
00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:16.549
for and degradation of the rules of gender
and sexual identity that “good families”

51
00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.549
obeyed.

52
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.220
This was the new order of things in horror.

53
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.660
These stories were in high contrast with those
of decades prior, where the monster was still

54
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.220
an external force we could fight and destroy.

55
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.090
In recent years, the queer villain/anti-hero
has made an interesting and largely welcome

56
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.210
return within horror, as we have seen an increase
in the psychological complexity of its monsters

57
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.540
and the conflicted nature of its heroes and
victims.

58
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.470
Anne Rice’s vampires come to mind as an
example, as well as Bryan Fuller’s TV series,

59
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.620
Hannibal.

60
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.210
In pervious horror-themed videos I’ve discussed
the drawn empathy between queer peoples and

61
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.210
monsters.

62
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.500
We see ourselves in monsters because we have
also been cast out of society.

63
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.900
We’ve been decreed unfit for all audiences,
something we must protect women and children

64
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.900
from.

65
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.040
We must be regulated, and if necessary, slain
— for no other reason than how we are different

66
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.650
from society’s expectations.

67
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.750
So we look at Frankenstein’s creation and
think, well, I’m also a social outcast,

68
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.750
and I have feelings.

69
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.320
I have a heart, and aspirations, social needs,
and dreams of living a good life.

70
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.540
Shouldn’t that mean that he does also?

71
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540
But there’s something that’s overlooked.

72
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.760
That queer people are fundamentally the same
as straight people.

73
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.900
And just as there is narcissism, ego, exploitation,
and abuse among straight people — When it

74
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.920
comes to queer people… sometimes a monster…
is just a monster.

75
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.300
It’s like we — queer people in our relationships
— are so conditioned to seeing the person

76
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.900
behind the monster that we overlook the elements
that are genuinely monstrous because to us,

77
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.710
as historical societal outcasts who lacked
connection to human society at large, we value

78
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.090
the human connection enough to tolerate or
even condone monstrous behaviour.

79
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.740
And yes, we’re always on the lookout for
monsters who want to eat your heart.

80
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.730
But far more insidious is the monster that
wants to eat your mind.

81
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.580
Your self worth.

82
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:28.900
And we seem to be very comfortable with those
monsters.

83
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:38.840
Over the course of its three seasons, Hannibal,
lead by out gay show-runner Bryan Fuller,

84
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.090
made a significant impact on both the horror
and crime drama fandoms.

85
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.630
With a focus on comprehending the psychology
of serial killers — the driving line of

86
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.030
the show was built around learning how to
develop human connections with people who

87
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.800
lack humanity.

88
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.080
Empathy for those who cannot empathize.

89
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.389
The emotional through-line of the show, however,
is built around the relationship between the

90
00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.830
titular antagonist Hannibal Lecter, and the
Psychological Profiler Will Graham.

91
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.690
In the book Red Dragon the story begins, and
the infamous Dr. Lecter — Hannibal the Cannibal

92
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.190
— is incarcerated.

93
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.010
Will Graham is recruited by the FBI to track
down a serial killer, and it’s referenced

94
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.810
that this is not the first time the FBI has
approached Will for consultation.

95
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.650
Apparently, Will and the FBI had worked with
Hannibal Lecter, who was a practicing psychiatrist,

96
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.650
to profile one of a number of serial killers.

97
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.940
Eventually, Will realized it was Hannibal
who was the killer that they were tracking,

98
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.250
and Hannibal nearly killed him before he was
arrested.

99
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.940
The result was a complete fallout with the
FBI, and Will himself coping with the trauma

100
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:57.040
for years before Agent Jack Crawford tracked
him down again to help with a case.

101
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.680
But through the mystery of the Red Dragon,
there are constant call backs to Will’s

102
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.260
work with the FBI and his twisted relationship
with Hannibal, which… it’s hinted... that

103
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.389
they were much closer than we’re being led
to believe.

104
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:14.280
The Hannibal TV series for NBC focused around
filling in these plot details.

105
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.560
What would a relationship between Hannibal
and Will be like?

106
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.020
How did they get to that point in Red Dragon?

107
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.160
What did it take to bring Hannibal down?

108
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.639
And most importantly, appropriately presenting
Will Graham in a way that honours his collection

109
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.760
of neurotic behaviours that were outlined
in the book.

110
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.610
In the series, Will Graham is a cocktail of
personality disorders, as he describes, closer

111
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.449
to autism and aspergers than an antisocial
personality disorder.

112
00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:45.620
Will is able to look at a setting, and accurately
describe an individual based on cues within

113
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.620
the scene.

114
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.230
Now while this could do wonders on Drag Race
for reading the other queens—

115
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:58.000
—this has a very practical application for
crime scene investigation.

116
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.720
By looking at the scene of a murder, Will
can slip into the mind of the killer.

117
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.730
He can observe clues, see the sequence of
the events, and then construct the psychological

118
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.930
profile of the person who did the murder based
on who he becomes while he re-expiriences

119
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.930
it.

120
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.650
Developing a profile of a serial killer is
useful in determining how they select their

121
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.650
targets.

122
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.430
Given how most serial killers operate, figuring
out how they select their victims could lead

123
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.370
investigators to where the serial killers
live, or intercept them before they kill again.

124
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.590
From observing these crime scenes, Will can
figure out how they think and what they think

125
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.700
about their victims.

126
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.490
Will, from a perspective of self-analysis,
reports to the FBI what he feels and thinks

127
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.550
when he re-lives the murder.

128
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.391
A psychological profile is constructed based
on who Will says he becomes.

129
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:53.400
In the mythology of the show, Will’s perspective
is second-to-none.

130
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.230
Now, for Will, that does mean that he has
to distance himself from his own mind and

131
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:05.360
take on the world view of people who conduct
very… elaborate crimes.

132
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.191
Naturally this kind of identity flux is of
immense interest to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who

133
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:14.680
first wants to study Will, but then as he
learns the extent of Will’s ability, begins

134
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.380
to feel the need to transform Will.

135
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.930
Hannibal has an unparalleled capacity to read
and interpret body language.

136
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.550
Contrast to Will’s ability to construct
human models based on reading environment.

137
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.950
He sees Will’s neurotic behaviour as the
result of Will rejecting elements of his own

138
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.950
identity.

139
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.050
Hannibal feels that Will's ability to see
into the heads of serial killers is an indication

140
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.610
that Will is drawn to these people — and
that Will can only be his true self while

141
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:57.050
he is re-experiencing these murders.

142
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:02.760
The show is ambiguous about whether this is
or is not, in fact, the case.

143
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.690
Will seems to adapt his personality to whoever
he is with — so what Hannibal sees may be

144
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.980
a reflection of himself, instead of the real
Will.

145
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.500
His interactions with Will are most likely
to be a matter of Hannibal interacting with

146
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.330
Will’s interpretation of Hannibal.

147
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.600
But this is the psychology of fictional characters
so take it with a grain of salt.

148
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.420
While the show begins as a kind of... best
possible version of a procedural cop drama,

149
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.550
the serial killing becomes a vessel for Hannibal
and Will to connect.

150
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.300
Two men who keep people at arms length because
they fear human contact for one reason or

151
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.300
another.

152
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.100
Through a discourse on why Will feels the
way he does, he is drawn to someone who offers

153
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.880
him clarity of identity.

154
00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:03.610
And through the process of Will empathising
with monsters, Hannibal is comforted in knowing

155
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.680
that there is someone who could and would
understand him.

156
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.360
And while Hannibal takes peevish delight in
being beyond comprehension…

157
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:22.540
…Mads Michelson delivers a Hannibal that
is yearning for contact with a human from

158
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.830
whom he does not have to leverage emotional
intimacy with.

159
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.830
Now.

160
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.740
There’s hardly a discourse to be had here
that actively verifies the textual evidence

161
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:40.680
to confirm that Will and Hannibal are more
or less romantically engaged.

162
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:49.720
It really doubles down on the gay stuff as
the show goes on, but it was still there in

163
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.330
season 1.

164
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:58.400
But I’m not sure you can qualify it as GAY
representation in its purist sense.

165
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.310
Both because the show’s driving relationship
existed in subtext, but also because the development

166
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:09.450
of Will and Hannibal was focused around empathizing
with people who we maybe should not empathize

167
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.450
with.

168
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.350
But it’s some of the best and most insightful
queer coding that’s ever made it into a

169
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.430
visual medium.

170
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.070
These are two men, coping with different kinds
of deep-seeded trauma from their youth.

171
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.880
They keep themselves isolated and distant
because they are familiar with society’s

172
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.020
fear or disgust with what they are.

173
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.870
One hides in plain sight, holding a shield
of lavish opulence that enchants those around

174
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:40.160
him into believing that nobody this gentlemanly
and eccentric could be anything else.

175
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.670
The other, keeps himself physically distant,
preferring the unconditional friendship of

176
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.670
animals.

177
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.529
Brilliant, solitary, engrossed in their hobbies.

178
00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:51.660
They dream of normality, paternity — being
in a family.

179
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.140
Though they have both reserved themselves
to their lives, and their fantasies.

180
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.630
And when they meet, by complete accident,
they recognize that they see their own fantasies

181
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.050
in the other, making steps to develop their
own kind of family — from the people who

182
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.380
need them most.

183
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:14.830
The main difference is that… one of them
knowingly eats people.

184
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.840
And this is just the thing, right?

185
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.650
It’s very clearly gay without saying it
is.

186
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.090
In fact, by all accounts, Bryan Fuller fully
intended to give Will and Hannibal an explicit

187
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.380
romantic arc.

188
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:31.170
Mads Michelson said that during the filming
of the last scene of Season 3, he was trying

189
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.930
very hard not to kiss Hugh Dancy.

190
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.650
That’s… not acting, apparently.

191
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.510
The intention to canonize the Hannibal and
Will relationship may also be one of the reasons

192
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.550
why NBC didn’t move ahead with a 4th season.

193
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.220
Because although there were lesbian characters
on the show, lesbians are famously more easy

194
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.730
to sell to advertisers.

195
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.800
Which is why you see a lot more lesbian rep
in kids cartoons these days.

196
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.240
But gay characters, at least gay lead characters,
are still something that network TV shies

197
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.240
away from.

198
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.700
It’s that threat of penetration that creeps
under the skin of a lot of executives and

199
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.200
viewers.

200
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.080
Subconsciously creating an unease around gay
men that isn’t there for gay women.

201
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.560
At least as long as the gay women look like
this.

202
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.060
But in spite of the avid, and continuing flow
of fan art depicting Mickelson and Dancy in

203
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:20.320
compromising postions donning varying degrees
of undress, I’m not only hesitant to label

204
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.040
this as good gay representation, I’m slightly
resistant to it.

205
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.510
God forbid we have a generation of gays who
describe themselves as a Hannigram power couple.

206
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.960
What they have, while intense and fun to watch,
is still… very toxic.

207
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.970
You’ve got a know-it-all, gaslighting, mansplainer
on one hand.

208
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.019
And on the other, you have a passive-aggressive,
self-victimizing martyr.

209
00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:47.690
That should not be relationship goals.

210
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.160
And while there are fans who realize that
no, the point of the show is that you should

211
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.880
probably get some help if you see yourself
as Will and/or Hannibal, there’s quite a

212
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.450
romantic drive in the show’s fanbase.

213
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:14.990
I’ve even seen the show be compared abundantly
to the online comics Killing Stalking and

214
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.540
Warehouse, and I see where the take is coming
from, but I’m not entirely sure that I agree

215
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.570
with it.

216
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.550
Killing Stalking is a story about a serial
killer who has complete dominant control over

217
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.660
another man.

218
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.620
Who explicitly wants to use and exploit a
literal prisoner.

219
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.360
The added twist is that the prisoner is in
love with the captor — or at least thinks

220
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.690
he is.

221
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:42.089
This is less about relationship toxicity and
more a carnivalesque example of abuse in relationships.

222
00:16:42.089 --> 00:16:46.760
Warehouse tells a story of assault and abuse
brought on by childhood trauma.

223
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:52.550
A revenge fantasy of sorts where neither of
the characters are all that likeable, and

224
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.560
after an untold amount of torture, the victim’s
mind breaks.

225
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.410
Leading to the victim accepting an actual
relationship with his abuser.

226
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.630
In both cases, the power dynamic is all off.

227
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.120
One character has far more power than the
other.

228
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.569
But Hannibal functions a little differently.

229
00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.689
Will is rarely, if ever, a prisoner specifically
of Hannibal’s.

230
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:17.679
In fact, Hannibal is more often being held
captive in a situation Will had orchestrated

231
00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:18.679
somehow.

232
00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:23.510
This fits more of the bill of relationship
toxicity… because Hannibal is never really

233
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.890
trying to dominate will.

234
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.210
In season 1, Hannibal’s objective is to
manipulate Will into becoming something that

235
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.940
he is repressing.

236
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.700
He urges Will to admit that he enjoyed killing
someone that he had to kill to save another

237
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.000
life, and going further in the series, urges
Will to do it again.

238
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.080
Will does not realize that he’s being manipulated
by Hannibal though until Hannibal has already

239
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.519
perfectly framed him for the murder of multiple
people, resulting in Will being sent to a

240
00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:56.049
hospital for the criminally insane.

241
00:17:56.049 --> 00:18:00.080
Going into the second season is interesting
because Will has a greater awareness of Hannibal’s

242
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080
methods.

243
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.519
He both trusts and distrusts Hannibal — and,
in an attempt to assassinate Hannibal while

244
00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:12.210
he was inside the asylum — Will demonstrates
that he is willing and capable to take power

245
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.590
into his own hands.

246
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:19.779
Thereafter, the power-dynamic in their relationship
becomes much more evenly shared between them.

247
00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:24.049
Each demonstrating that they are not willing
to tolerate the other’s bullshit.

248
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:27.840
But each demonstrating that they’re going
to keep getting up to their bullshit.

249
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.109
And yet… its also abundantly clear that
they would not have this kind of emotional

250
00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:50.820
intimacy if they didn’t keep get up to their
bullshit at all.

251
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.029
These kinds of bitchy, catty relationships
are sort of ride or die situations that revolve

252
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:59.519
around a cycle of stockpiling emotions for
a once-a-year blowout fight.

253
00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.110
Maybe part of them likes these fights?

254
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.269
Maybe they get bored and tired of people who
don’t play mind games?

255
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:09.720
Maybe they’re self-aware enough to know
that this is just who they are, and they know

256
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.879
that nobody else in the world is going to
put up with them.

257
00:19:12.879 --> 00:19:18.100
There are darker sides to us, more intimate,
and personal parts.

258
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.759
Little back-brain remnants of feral humans
stuck in our heads.

259
00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:29.230
These parts of us tell us to pit ourselves
against each other, seek supremacy, push ourselves

260
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.600
into authority, to seek our own pleasure at
the expense of others.

261
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.409
And yet, our society is so tightly constructed
around co-operation, civility, and respecting

262
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:45.519
the other that our feral-brains are not useful
for existing in this modern world.

263
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:50.100
It is, after all, the co-operation that has
allowed civilization to flourish.

264
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.850
We often hide these parts of ourselves.

265
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.700
Not because we’re embarrassed about them,
but because we acknowledge that there is almost

266
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.010
no way to function in society by letting these
internal savage parts of us bubble up to the

267
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.010
surface.

268
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.470
It’s not just everyone who we can let see
this part of ourselves.

269
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:11.989
Because by exposing these very closely guarded
artefacts of prehistoric human tribalism,

270
00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:16.730
we are letting someone know that we, ourselves,
are aware that there are parts of us that

271
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.169
lack humanity.

272
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:21.850
And while everyone knows that we all have
corners of our mind that are still overgrown

273
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.450
and wild… it is not in good taste to admit
it.

274
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.070
There is always a risk that the person you
trust will point you out as a monster.

275
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:35.700
Hannibal and Will, in this sense, lucked out
with each other… or… were incredibly unlucky

276
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.210
to come across each other.

277
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.850
For both men have a capacity to read beyond
what the other is saying.

278
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:46.309
Their ability to reach each other fosters
a kindred sense of belonging.

279
00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:51.659
For lack of literally anyone else who can
understand them, they crave connection in

280
00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:52.919
each other.

281
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.000
Is this romantic?

282
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.029
Actually...

283
00:20:57.029 --> 00:21:01.070
My significant argument about a situation
which separates an abusive relationship from

284
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.789
a romantic one is a matter of power.

285
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:09.159
Who has it in a relationship, and who is it
being taken from.

286
00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:12.760
This is pivotal in understanding and interpreting
Killing Stalking and Warehouse.

287
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.559
And this is also the case in the first season
of Hannibal… where Will is mostly unaware

288
00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:20.580
that he’s even being manipulated.

289
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.480
His subconscious is filling in the blanks
though.

290
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.480
However, as Will becomes more aware of who
and what Hannibal is… he begins to make

291
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.690
steps to reclaim his power.

292
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.220
In the second season, especially toward the
end, there could be an argument that Will

293
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.539
holds the greater amount of power because
Hannibal demonstrates abundantly that his

294
00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:45.229
decisions are reactive to Will’s actions.

295
00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:49.450
But by the end of the series, the question
arises of why Will and Hannibal stay ‘together’

296
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.549
in spite of lying, manipulation, entrapment,
killing each-others friends, killing their

297
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:59.499
own daughter-figure, tampering with evidence,
feeding their friends to each other, numerous

298
00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:05.880
attempts to kill each other and a solid attempt
on one to ablate and eat the other’s brain.

299
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.760
On one hand, within the mythology of the show…

300
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.190
I just don’t think they’d be that interested
in each other if they didn’t pull this kind

301
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.190
of shit.

302
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.179
It’s like the Joker and Batman.

303
00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:20.769
What would they have to do with themselves
if they didn’t have this other guy to keep

304
00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:21.840
edging them on?

305
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.730
Their numerous attempts to kill each other
could easily be seen as a way of pressing

306
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.169
each-other’s buttons to see where the other
will draw the line at what they are willing

307
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:31.519
to tolerate.

308
00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:33.399
But on the other hand…

309
00:22:33.399 --> 00:22:35.019
The alternative is being alone.

310
00:22:35.019 --> 00:22:38.850
You’ve let someone in your head, what happens
when you let them out?

311
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:45.649
Yet in spite of the murders and the cannibalism,
Will and Hannibal together establish an even

312
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:49.149
ground where the monstrous parts of themselves
are in the open.

313
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:52.929
Nobody would ever look past Hannibal’s cannibalism
or art piece murders.

314
00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:54.259
But Will does.

315
00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:59.239
Will looks at each of the Chesapeake Ripper
murders and thinks: who is the kind of person

316
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:01.059
doing this.

317
00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:04.409
While everyone else thinks what kind of monster
would do this?

318
00:23:04.409 --> 00:23:09.590
And similarly, Hannibal is the only person
willing or able to look past Will’s neuroses.

319
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.739
Alana Bloom refuses to romance Will because
she sees a subject.

320
00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:18.330
Jack Crawford sees an ace-in-the-hole for
catching serial killers.

321
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.820
Hannibal sees a person.

322
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:27.179
So the pair of them can see past the monstrosities,
and appreciate the human being in the chair

323
00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:28.289
across from the other.

324
00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:32.429
So naturally… we, queer people are drawn
to this.

325
00:23:32.429 --> 00:23:37.899
Because we, too, want people to look past
the homosexual, the bisexual, the transgender,

326
00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:44.350
the genderqueer, nonbinary, fluid labels that
have been imposed upon us by society and ourselves.

327
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:51.200
We see what Will and Hannibal have and we,
too, see past the horror of the show, the

328
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.590
horrors that they put each other through.

329
00:23:52.590 --> 00:24:03.049
Because it is not the horror we want, it is
the unconditional connection.

330
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:05.100
We can endure horror.

331
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.580
Each of us — we already have.

332
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.010
What we cannot endure is solitude.

333
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:15.649
In a discussion of representation, why would
we clamor for this, and yet leave Love, Simon

334
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:18.489
out to dry at the box office?

335
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:22.950
No discredit to Ms. Albertalli, but could
it be that queer people do not emotionally

336
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:29.259
engage with a teenage twink whose dream-style
love story goes off like choreographed fireworks?

337
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.070
Most of us have never experienced that.

338
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.669
But a toxic relationship we aren’t willing
to admit is toxic?

339
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:36.350
That’s far more likely.

340
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.210
And because of that, are we not more drawn
to the reflection of the darker part of us?

341
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.110
And while we don’t want straight people
en masse to think of us as cannibal serial

342
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.919
killers… we do like to see ourselves represented.

343
00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:53.279
We want to see the darker parts of our lives
staring back at us from the other side of

344
00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.460
a mirror, or camera.

345
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.000
Being gay isn’t pride floats and kissing
at the top of ferris wheels.

346
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.090
And neither is it the suffering that society
puts us through.

347
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.090
Not always.

348
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.039
When you stick a bunch of traumatized people
into a community, you’re going to get a

349
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:08.820
handful who don’t have the best ways of
coping with that.

350
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.289
And as people do, sometimes we just fall in
love with these monsters.

351
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:17.769
And our need for Will and Hannibal to find
a way to co-exist stems from our own memories…

352
00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:23.039
wondering if there was any way we and our
exes could get over our drama and make it

353
00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:24.039
work.

354
00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:33.750
Because when you find someone who understands
you… who truly understands you… you want

355
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:42.620
to hold onto them forever…

356
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.090
Vampires have always been a little bit gay.

357
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.369
And they’ve always been part of human history,
believe it or not.

358
00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:52.409
Though what we recognize as modern day vampires
is a product of the last five hundred years

359
00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:56.809
or so, there are creatures which could resemble
Vampires going back to Ancient Rome.

360
00:25:56.809 --> 00:26:02.509
The Greek Goddess Hecate, a triple deity,
was associated with magic, witchcraft, the

361
00:26:02.509 --> 00:26:06.989
moon, the undead, the night, and wild, forested
areas.

362
00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:11.429
She was said to turn women into creatures
which fed off the blood of men.

363
00:26:11.429 --> 00:26:16.570
These women would either be vicious monsters,
or keep rural roads and paths safe for travelling

364
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.570
women.

365
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.919
Hecate herself was a later addition to the
Greek Pantheon, and some scholars believe

366
00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:26.070
she was the Greek adaptation of a goddess
that may have originated in Egypt or what

367
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.119
is modern day Turkey.

368
00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:29.769
Egypt itself possessing a version of vampires.

369
00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:34.230
Though these figures being less monsters and
more the result of a society which religiously

370
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:40.419
revered a rigorous relationship between life
and death, and the pathways to and from either.

371
00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:44.639
Blood is one of the earliest symbols that
humans associated with the concept of life

372
00:26:44.639 --> 00:26:46.869
and death, for obvious reasons.

373
00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:51.700
It’s not a stretch to say that our earliest
societies would have had a fixation on blood’s

374
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.539
symbolic ability to transfer life from one
to another.

375
00:26:55.539 --> 00:26:59.570
In these days, vampires didn’t need to be
gay because everybody was gay.

376
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.369
And then Christianity took off for… a hot
minute and then before you knew it everything

377
00:27:03.369 --> 00:27:07.779
that was interesting about human culture was
a sin or a demon.

378
00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:11.399
So Vampires became more monstrous than they
already were.

379
00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:15.549
The vampire especially was a symbol of distance
from God’s natural order.

380
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:20.249
Which… wasn’t much of a difference from
the way vampires had previously been depicted

381
00:27:20.249 --> 00:27:23.249
violating the natural order of life and death.

382
00:27:23.249 --> 00:27:29.759
Because it used to be you only went to hell
for committing cosmic treason, cheating death,

383
00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:33.490
direct acts of warfare against the Gods, or
actively trying to end the world.

384
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:40.070
But these days, eternal damnation awaits you
for something as easy as masturbation.

385
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:45.470
And while once Vampires were beasts and monsters,
beholden to the whim of their associated deities,

386
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.779
vampires in christian orthodoxy were creatures
who had simply strayed from God’s plan and

387
00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:50.779
protection.

388
00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:55.879
As a result, they resembled not only monsters,
but men and women who embodied the antithesis

389
00:27:55.879 --> 00:27:57.700
of the good christian citizen.

390
00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:02.149
Ranging from cannibalism, sexual perversion,
and vast displays of opulence.

391
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:06.140
But it was never something explicitly explored
— instead vampires lived within folklore

392
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:12.489
as parables preaching the need to stay away
from people who exhibited un-christianly behaviour.

393
00:28:12.489 --> 00:28:16.979
The 18th and 19th centuries marked a shift
in the way many people in Europe examined

394
00:28:16.979 --> 00:28:18.899
their heritage and mythology.

395
00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:22.820
Additionally spurred by the advent of the
printing press, allowing an ease-of-access

396
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:28.289
for increasingly literate populations, European
writers grew tired of dramatic wealthy families

397
00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:29.889
and war stories.

398
00:28:29.889 --> 00:28:34.249
Attention turned towards fantasy stories,
science fiction, a more gripping and tangible

399
00:28:34.249 --> 00:28:35.799
expression of imagination.

400
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:42.149
And particularly, a re-examination outside
the rigid christian moral take of European

401
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:43.149
folklore.

402
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:46.860
And within this, we began to decode the queerness
of the vampire.

403
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.239
Even if we were just using vampires to call
out our queer friends for being jerks.

404
00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:55.490
In 1819, John Polidori published The Vampyre.

405
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.639
In this story, the vampire, Lord Ruthven,
is written as an aristocratic seducer.

406
00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:03.169
A rich man who has given up the idea of following
society’s norms.

407
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:07.720
This was a great fear in western Europe at
the time, by the way, especially among poorer

408
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.720
people.

409
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.229
The catholic church had maintained power for
nearly 1500 years thanks to a propaganda effort

410
00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:17.149
that said that poverty was pivotal to morality
and getting into heaven.

411
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:21.539
The more accepting the poor were with poverty,
the less likely they would be to rise up against

412
00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.509
the wealthy and powerful.

413
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:28.620
And it meant the church got to decide who
got to be wealthy and powerful.

414
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.880
Yet the projected messaging, and this was
heavily adopted by the poor, was that excessive

415
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:40.200
wealth was the most pivotal component in distancing
oneself from propper sexual conduct.

416
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.539
Specifically, homosexuality.

417
00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:45.820
But Palidori wasn’t writing about the corruption
of homosexuality, oh no.

418
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.950
His Lord Ruthven was, quite obviously, the
real life Lord Byron — who… may or may

419
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.700
not have been a vampire himself.

420
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.389
But he was fabulously wealthy, fabulously
sexy, fabulously bisexual, and who Palidori

421
00:29:58.389 --> 00:30:01.359
had been fabulously in love with for a time.

422
00:30:01.359 --> 00:30:05.609
But Lord Byron got bored, and casually moved
on to suck the life out of some other, less

423
00:30:05.609 --> 00:30:06.609
talented, sycophant.

424
00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:10.789
Which normally wasn’t a problem, but Palidori
was salty enough that he was gonna tell the

425
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:16.349
world just what kind of sexy… irresistible
monster Lord George Gordon Byron actually

426
00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:17.349
was.

427
00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:21.330
And probably also how Palidori would take
him back in half a second if Byron came around.

428
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.320
We all know a guy like that, don’t we?

429
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.269
Later on in the century, In 1871, a vampire
story with — let’s say... ‘subtle’

430
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:33.789
lesbian undertones — “Carmilla” by Sheridan
Le Fanu, was published.

431
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:37.749
The idea of a vampire female presence was
nothing new, but one preying on other women

432
00:30:37.749 --> 00:30:55.299
was revolutionary 
and scandalous.

433
00:30:55.299 --> 00:31:41.269
Feel like I could get demonetized for that.

434
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:45.729
And then came Dracula by Bram Stoker, who
many believe to have been a closeted gay man

435
00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:50.739
in love with his employer, Henry Irving, who
many believe was the progenitor of the character

436
00:31:50.739 --> 00:31:52.159
of Dracula, himself.

437
00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:57.509
For this, Stoker himself was a young, impressionable
Johnathan Harker, trapped in the castle of

438
00:31:57.509 --> 00:32:03.149
opulence, alone, with a man worth his obsession
— kept from his benign relationships with

439
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:04.149
women.

440
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:08.969
Dracula’s most famous screen incarnation,
the 1931 adaptation, which is actually adapted

441
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:14.359
more so from the play than the book for budgetary
reasons, was directed by Todd Browning, a

442
00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:15.809
gay director.

443
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:20.950
And he made his Dracula sexy, exotic, and
fabulous with that flowing cape.

444
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.490
Throughout the mid 20th century vampires fell
into the realm of b-movie camp, having more

445
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.609
than one meet-up with Abbott and Costello.

446
00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:32.470
And though many a gay man found ample sexual
tension between Christopher Lee’s Dracula

447
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.700
and Peter Kushing’s Van Helsing in the Hammer
horror classics, there wasn’t much to speak

448
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.769
of gay vampires in mainstream culture at the
time.

449
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:43.639
If you want more on Dracula’s queer coding,
my video Monsters in the Closet goes more

450
00:32:43.639 --> 00:32:45.029
in depth on that.

451
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:49.960
The pre-Stonewall era for gay men in American
society was mostly a time of repression, fear,

452
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.840
and the darkness of the closet.

453
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.789
It was a time of conformity not just for gay
people, but everyone, who were expected to

454
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:59.580
play their role in order to keep America safe
from “Godless Communists.”

455
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.881
Senator Joseph McCarthy and his notoriously
closeted right hand man Roy Cohn (and others

456
00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:08.610
of their ilk) were hunting not just communists
but gays as well.

457
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.700
There were congressional hearings aimed at
rooting “sexual perverts” out of government

458
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.830
jobs, and surveillance of the American postal
service for gay magazines continued until

459
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.620
1966.

460
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.700
The Lavender Menace knew no bounds.

461
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.010
Finally, as the 60’s hit its stride, the
sexual revolution began to take hold, and

462
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:29.049
the Stonewall riots forced mainstream America
to deal with the existence of gay men and

463
00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:33.580
women… it was only a matter of time before
the gay vampire returned.

464
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.909
But this time he wasn’t a monster, but a
hero.

465
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:39.779
Ironically, a Byronic hero.

466
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:44.210
After the tragic loss of her young daughter
to leukaemia, an aspiring San Francisco based

467
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.809
writer named Anne Rice began dealing with
her grief by writing about creatures that

468
00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:51.090
could, potentially, live forever.

469
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:56.729
Now before we get TOO far into Mrs. Rice I
want to cover the sticky subject of her opinion

470
00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:59.820
on fan-fiction, since I know it’s a hot
button issue.

471
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.169
The Anne Rice V Fan Fiction war began around
the release of her novel Merrick, at the dawn

472
00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:05.529
of the e-book revolution.

473
00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:09.409
Her publisher, believing physical books were
dying, wanted to publish Merrick as an e-book

474
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.869
exclusive release.

475
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:15.649
And so they told Rice that any fan fiction
available online would cannibalize those ebook

476
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:20.080
sales, advising her to file a cease and desist
against all fan fiction websites.

477
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.990
The e-book exclusive of Merrick ended up doing
absolutely terrible sales, because e-books

478
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:28.890
were not taking over the world and most people
barely even knew they existed at the time,

479
00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.390
and so a physical copy was eventually released.

480
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:36.679
But, due to some advice from her publisher,
Anne Rice has been known as the lady who hates

481
00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.530
fan-fiction ever since.

482
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:45.230
Even though in 2012 she said:

483
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:51.013
However, Rice’s adventures in publishing
began much earlier than Ebooks and the internet.

484
00:34:51.013 --> 00:34:56.830
In her premier novel, Interview With The Vampire,
she used these creatures as sympathetic heroes.

485
00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.990
Through them, she conceptualized both the
concepts of death and the illusion of immortality.

486
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.090
However, her vampires weren’t going to get
weighed down with all that coding and subtext

487
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.360
brought about by Christian conservatism.

488
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.290
Her vampires were gonna be here and (mostly)
queer.

489
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.770
As a woman who lived in San Francisco, and
who openly engaged with queer elements of

490
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:21.080
The City in the 60s and 70s, she took on by
osmosis, the internal lifestyle struggles

491
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.120
of the queer community.

492
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.550
Their lives, their heartbreaks, and the ways
that their ostracised existence generated

493
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.770
problems that would not typically be seen
or understood in straight circles.

494
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.601
But Anne Rice was going to make straight people
understand it… by making them vampires.

495
00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:41.890
Vampires who, in spite of being monsters,
she made you sympathise with.

496
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:46.460
Published in 1976, Rice’s first novel: Interview
With The Vampire, tells the story of Louis

497
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:52.380
De Point Du Lac, an immigrant to America in
1791, who ran a plantation just outside of

498
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.380
New Orleans.

499
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.370
A happy man, he cared for his mother and sister,
as well as a younger brother Paul, a very

500
00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.370
religious man who claimed to see angelic visions
regularly.

501
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.790
After an argument in which Paul told Louis
that the Virgin Mary had come to him and told

502
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:10.490
him to sell the plantation, Paul accidentally
died, though some believed it was suicide,

503
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.140
and others believe the he’d simply seen
god.

504
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.930
Louis took to drinking to cope with the grief,
and moved to New Orleans, not really caring

505
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.140
for this whole ‘life’ thing much anymore.

506
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.610
Which is when he met Lestat De Lioncourt,
a vampire who grooms Louis into accepting

507
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.000
the dark gift himself.

508
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.440
Eternity in the night doesn’t really…
make Louis feel any better though, naturally.

509
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.680
His eternity began while he thought of nothing
but the loss of his loved one, and for the

510
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.850
rest of his eternity that is who he would
be.

511
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.370
While Lestat tries to win Louis over with
gifts and companionship, their relationship

512
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.510
develops with an unhealthy amount of gaslighting.

513
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.210
And once again we see a pair of men slip into
a codependent relationship where neither is

514
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.700
particularly welcome anywhere else but each
other’s company.

515
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.070
For Lestat, this arrangement offers him a
feeling of importance, and someone he can

516
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.070
‘fix.’

517
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.620
And for Louis, this arrangement offers him
someone who can make him feel anything at

518
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.620
all.

519
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.720
And though they enjoy being with each other,
to a point, what they dislike is that they

520
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.730
have no other option but to be with each other.

521
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.850
Who else would accept them?

522
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.200
Who else could?

523
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.170
It doesn’t help that Lestat is consistently
rolling his eyes at Louis because this boy

524
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:24.450
still hasn’t gotten over his catholic hang-ups
and refuses to drink the blood of another

525
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.450
human.

526
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.690
Just rats.

527
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.020
When he finally does drink from a person,
it’s a lonely, dying girl who’s weeping

528
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.840
over the corpse of her mother who had died
from the plague.

529
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.900
He nearly drains the girl and then flees.

530
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.870
Only to find Lestat waiting for him at home
with the girl, ready to turn her into a vampire

531
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.200
so that Louis and he can have a daughter,
Claudia.

532
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.320
So they can be the gay dads!

533
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.080
It takes some convincing but Louis gives in,
creating a daughter who will never physically

534
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.330
age.

535
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.150
Because like every other couple who shacked
up together too quick to find the magic fading

536
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.440
just as fast, they think a child is gonna
fix everything.

537
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.790
Claudia herself grows up, trapped in a child’s
body though with the temperament and desires

538
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.060
of a grown woman.

539
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:11.630
Over the years, she fosters positive relationships
with her fathers, drawing close to either

540
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.120
for different reasons.

541
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.110
She is more gentle and nurturing than Lestat,
and empathises with Louis over their shared

542
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.200
trauma — the loss of family.

543
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.750
And yet, she gives into the darkness where
Louis wont, going on nightly hunts with Lestat

544
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.750
for human blood.

545
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:32.230
But, as time passes, Louis and Claudia decide
that Louis really needs to break up with Lestat.

546
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.430
That’s he’s abusive, and gas lighty, and
needs to go.

547
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.160
And so they kill him.

548
00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.960
Well they kill him a few times because he’s
a vampire and he doesn’t take to death well.

549
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960
They don’t even manage to kill him when
they do kill him.

550
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960
Why?

551
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.530
Because Lestat is a bad ass bitch.

552
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.140
But they do manage to escape to Europe, where
they hunt around for other vampires like them,

553
00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:56.620
eventually finding a troop in Paris lead by
Armand, who in the books is a Ukrainian teenaged

554
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:17.000
twink described as:

555
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.910
But in the movie is…

556
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.910
Antonio Banderas.

557
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.530
Slight difference in interoperation, really.

558
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:27.040
But I understand it would have been hard to
have this scene between Brad Pitt and a sixteen

559
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.150
year old boy.

560
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.820
One might wonder why Anne Rice would create
a vampire so young and yet so adult as Armand?

561
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.350
But once again, Anne Rice was writing in 1970s
San Francisco.

562
00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:40.680
How many gay and trans teenaged runaways would
she have met who could have told her forty

563
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.270
years worth of life experiences, with an emotional
wisdom of someone even older?

564
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:50.180
Because as is common with her vampires, they
carry a kind of trauma with them.

565
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.440
Oftentimes, they are vampires because of their
trauma.

566
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.550
And yet, like us, they treat each other as
their trauma demands.

567
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:04.030
Either they inflict it on each other, or they
fear exposure to others, letting their trauma

568
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:09.960
twist and manipulate others away from who
they are — to fall in love with the facade,

569
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.250
never to let the face underneath see the light
of day.

570
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.190
And… these vampires hurt each other.

571
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.230
Louis does not and cannot trust Armand.

572
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.380
And Armand, in turn, hurts Louis.

573
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.720
Claudia dies, and the mask of immortality
shatters, and even Armand is no longer a child,

574
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.390
but a monster whose gruesome visage is a youthful
face which conceals centuries of schemes and

575
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.150
horrors.

576
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.550
Paradise lost.

577
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.470
Anne Rice let her Vampires rest in peace for
nearly ten years after that book.

578
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:42.860
But then, following her writing Cry to Heaven,
a very bisexual book about the castrati of

579
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.900
Italy, and the Sleeping Beauty Books, which
basically explore every kink and sexual orientation

580
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.240
imaingibale.

581
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.300
We finally got the sequel to Interview with
the Vampire…

582
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.300
The Vampire Lestat.

583
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.130
Typifying that there are “two sides to every
story”, we have Lestat’s take on the events

584
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.380
that Louis had described.

585
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.940
But while John Polidori’s Vampyre was marred
in queer subtext, Anne Rice was over that

586
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.160
shit.

587
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.210
No subtext.

588
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:09.310
No bachelors living together with ambiguous
shared parental responsibilities.

589
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.310
Lestat’s queer.

590
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.310
He’s gay.

591
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.310
That’s it.

592
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.200
He’s gay, he lives with his boyfriend, and
they’re theatre queens.

593
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.950
Lestat leaves his crumbling family estate
to live with the love of his life, Nicolas

594
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.400
de Lenfent, who he lovingly refers to as Nicky.

595
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.360
Nicky is a musician, and Lestat is an actor,
and they live together in Paris helping to

596
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360
run a small theatre.

597
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.730
And they’re not best friends.

598
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.820
They’re not roommates.

599
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.980
Rice makes it abundantly clear that they are
lovers.

600
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.760
When Lestat is turned into a vampire by his
suicidal maker, Magnus, he hides from Nicky.

601
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.160
Scared that he’ll be rejected.

602
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.840
But Nicky believes that it is Lestat who had
rejected him, even though Lestat sends him

603
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.240
expensive gifts like a Stradivarius violin.

604
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.250
The abandonment that so many of us in the
queer community fear sends Nicky into a spiraling

605
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.750
state of depression.

606
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:59.570
When he finally does meet with Lestat once
more, he begs to become a vampire.

607
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.630
At first Lestat refuses though eventually
gives in, but while turning Nicky he senses

608
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.520
the darkness in Nicky’s soul that has developed
because of his depression.

609
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:14.320
He can feel the love of his life slipping
away, even as he holds him closer than ever

610
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.710
before.

611
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.660
After becoming a vampire Nicky becomes nearly
catatonic, and eventually slips away from

612
00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.230
Lestat entirely.

613
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:27.520
And after centuries of dealing with depression
and severe mental illness, Nicky kills himself.

614
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.710
In a later book when Lestat travels to heaven
and hell— (Yes this happens.

615
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.170
Maybe, sort of, it's complicated.)

616
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.790
—he searches for Nicky’s soul but can’t
find him in either realm.

617
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:41.940
Leading to many years of solitude for Lestat,
mourning the complete and utter loss of his

618
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.940
Nicky.

619
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.800
Lestat and Nicky aren’t the only queer characters
in The Vampire Lestat though.

620
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.440
Most of the characters seem at least queer
adjacent, but the one that stands out the

621
00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.370
most to me is Gabrielle, Lestat’s mother.

622
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.420
After becoming a vampire, Lestat turns his
sickly mother as well.

623
00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.750
Upon her birth as a vampire, Gabrielle takes
on the appearance of a man, wearing only men’s

624
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.200
clothing and courting women.

625
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.610
Becoming, arguably, a trans or gender queer
character in the mid eighties.

626
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.560
She and Lestat stayed together for a long
while until just shortly after the French

627
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.890
Revolution when she leaves him.

628
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.870
As Rice’s vampire novels, which became known
as The Vampire Chronicles, continued, the

629
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.740
overall pansexuality of vampires was further
explored.

630
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.960
Since any vampire can seemingly fall in love
with any person, no matter their sex or gender

631
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960
expression.

632
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.340
Male characters are often referred to as beautiful,
while women are called handsome.

633
00:43:31.340 --> 00:44:00.700
Rice has spoken about her depiction of gay
vampires:

634
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:07.010
Anne Rice created a world that the queer community
felt wolcomed into, and one we felt we knew.

635
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.770
One of characters perceived as monsters by
many, and fetishized by others.

636
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.330
Where living forever was a possibility, but
where some vampires would go insane because

637
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.610
of being alone.

638
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.220
And that even for the brat-prince Lestat himself,
the anxiety of being alone is palpable.

639
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.460
It’s no surprise that anxiety is prevelant
in the queer community.

640
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.250
We’ve been outcast for one reason or another
— even those of us who are accepted by their

641
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.250
families.

642
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.520
Members of the queer community feel a desperate
need for connection.

643
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.530
For community.

644
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.230
For knowing we’re not alone in the world.

645
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.960
Much like Louis and Lestat travelled to Europe
and Northern Africa to find others like them,

646
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.060
in their respective books, we too search out
others like us.

647
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.120
But we’re not always welcomed into the community.

648
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.800
We don’t always find the fabled found family.

649
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.020
And so when someone does come along… even
if they’re monstrous, we may attach to them

650
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.250
out of necessity.

651
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.140
And never let them go.

652
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:07.760
We may change ourselves to be what they want,
and ask only for their company in return.

653
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:14.170
This is especially true for marginalized communities
within our marginalized community.

654
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.840
Queers who live with disabilities, or who
are mentally ill.

655
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.500
When being queer isn’t the only reason someone
might not love you, we’ll hold on to whatever

656
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.230
and whoever we can get.

657
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.700
No matter what they do to us.

658
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.100
No matter how little we mean to them.

659
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:46.260
Because at least we mean something to them.

660
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.970
As we engage with our media, the relationship
between queer people and monsters becomes

661
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:52.970
stronger.

662
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:59.700
There’s always been a component of monstrousness
in the inner circles of queer spaces — specifically

663
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.460
in the areas of kink, drag, and performance.

664
00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.620
It should come as a surprise to no one that
the booming popularity of adults going into

665
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:17.250
mouth-foaming frenzies for halloween arose
as queer people began receiving social and

666
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.560
political recognition

667
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.630
Queer people have a fascination with costumes
— and this is something documented for most

668
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.740
of our time in recorded history.

669
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.550
As social outsiders, there’s nothing more
appealing than becoming someone who is publicly

670
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.750
accepted.

671
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:42.420
Even if that costume was just a plain old
normal person.

672
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:48.870
When what’s under your skin is decried as
being freakish, you begin to see everything

673
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:54.980
as a costume — especially the conventions
of society that are taken for granted.

674
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.440
The business suit.

675
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.790
The Sunday dress.

676
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.580
The fake smile.

677
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.130
The things you wear to fit in with the straights.

678
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:09.730
Alternately, where once we were artists, creators,
rule breakers in our day to day lives, now

679
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:15.110
our creativity and rule-breaking may be tolerated
for certain events.

680
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:16.790
Halloween.

681
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.560
Pride parades.

682
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.150
Certain fairs where we can be ourselves.

683
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:27.340
And then there are the… twinks and gym bunnies
who put on a jock strap and harness and dance

684
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.630
on some tables.

685
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.350
A costume all its own.

686
00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:36.610
A problem with focusing so clearly on Halloween
and pride week as spaces where ‘true selves’

687
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:41.890
are acceptable is that we are being harassed
out of being our ‘true selves’ for the

688
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.020
rest of the year.

689
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.740
If you’re so excited for pride week so that
you can be a seven-day slut, why are you so

690
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.180
ashamed of sexual promiscuity for the other
fifty-one weeks?

691
00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:01.520
Obviously, this is how you want to live your
life — why are you tolerating only ONE week

692
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:11.570
where this behaviour is ‘permissible’
or even only tolerable by straight social-gatekeepers?

693
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:17.450
Modern manifestations of queer circles are
facing these struggles, as the cisgender-heterosexual

694
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:23.170
hegimony imparts more and more statutes for
conditional tolerance.

695
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:30.330
You can be accepted, but only if you can check
off A, B, and C on the application for public

696
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.620
recognition.

697
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.930
This is just a more nuanced version of outrightly
shutting out these identities and lifestyles

698
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.740
as a whole.

699
00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:45.270
Instead, SOME queer people can naturally fit
into these parameters.

700
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.400
Others will force themselves to conform for
the sake of social comforts and conveniences.

701
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.010
Others are either unable to conform, or refuse
to.

702
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.610
And why should they have to?

703
00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:02.930
Forcing hegemonistic spaces to remove restrictions
on a social definition of personhood — rather

704
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:09.480
than broadening an increasingly-complex cataloge
of valid identities — should be the main

705
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.900
objective of queer rights, I think.

706
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:21.420
Instead, we record and document every sub-genre
of sexuality and gender — deciding who can

707
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.490
be valid and when.

708
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:30.800
Instead of just realizing it’s nobody’s
business and letting people live their lives…

709
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:38.079
we are relegating queer noncomformists to
exist in the shadows.

710
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:43.330
And in the shadows, there are always monsters.

711
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:47.520
Given that queer circles at large were once
forced to live in the shadows, maybe this

712
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.610
is why we’ve always been drawn to the monsters
within them.

713
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:56.300
There’s also a theatrical element to the
beast, isn’t there?

714
00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:02.910
An ethereal fantasy constructed around the
Alfar of northern europe.

715
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.860
The strength and poise of the faefolk of the
Celts.

716
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:12.230
Oberon, The Earlking, and their court of nature
spirits of southern France and Germany that

717
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:16.720
survived the collapse of the Roman Empire.

718
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.200
All stories banned by the authority of the
Catholic Church.

719
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:26.750
And each figure recategorized as a servant
of Satan.

720
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:32.310
But the nature of our secret, solicit meetings
facilitated an exchange of ideas between the

721
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:37.150
rich, the educated, and those lacking in either.

722
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:43.160
Why wouldn’t the young, poor, rentboy growing
up on the streets of London be enchanted by

723
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:48.880
pillow-talk lessons of creatures and heroes
from an era where same-gender attraction was

724
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.260
not so taboo?

725
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:58.059
In which case, I may be suggesting that our
love of monsters — both academic and fetishistic

726
00:50:58.059 --> 00:51:04.240
— is a matter of carrying on the stories
and traditions from pagan cultures where our

727
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:10.660
identities and expressions of sexuality did
not hold the same taboo, as it has for the

728
00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:15.340
last fifteen hundred years.

729
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:22.400
This proves to us that a world can exist where
we can live without homophobic and transphobic

730
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.400
baggage.

731
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:29.730
Our freedom, our pride, does not need to be
fiction because our ancestors got by just

732
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.870
fine without homophobia.

733
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:39.660
We see that homophobia is in contradiction
to social cohesion, progress, social institutions,

734
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.990
trade, commerce, or family structures.

735
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.270
Maybe that gives us hope that it could be
different one day, or that we could eek out

736
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:55.460
our own existence where we can make this once-truth
a present day reality.

737
00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:00.970
The need to build a community has translated
into the trope of found family.

738
00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:06.470
Which itself is a defense mechanism from — to
this day — living in a world where your

739
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:15.540
family may push you out if you don’t fit
their checklist of acceptable identities.

740
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:21.050
Found family wasn’t intended to be a fiction
trope about a plucky group of misfits coming

741
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.150
together for a shared purpose.

742
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:31.271
It was necessary for queer survival — not
for the survival of our community… no, actual

743
00:52:31.271 --> 00:52:33.840
survival of individuals.

744
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:40.260
The alternative was filling the streets with
disowned and desperate queer youth.

745
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:46.560
And if there is one area where fiction and
reality overlap, it’s that monsters feed

746
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.830
on desperation.

747
00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:54.610
There are quiet corners of queer history that
we’ve omitted from the discussion at large.

748
00:52:54.610 --> 00:53:00.750
These are specifically rooted in white colonial
circles; and subsequently focused on a dynamic

749
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:05.100
of privilege, power, and exploitation.

750
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:10.171
Given that queer identity for a large section
of history was, itself, illegal, there were

751
00:53:10.171 --> 00:53:16.740
almost no legislative protections that queer
people would have been able to seek out.

752
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:22.700
Doubly true is that law enforcement itself
has had a history of targeting queer individuals

753
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.900
and whole communities alike.

754
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:31.940
A gay street kid who gets assaulted by an
established, closeted man has no legal recourse.

755
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:38.860
But even more unsettling are the ways that
we, as disowned and desperate people, tolerated

756
00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:45.570
these abusive partners simply because the
alternative was a never-ending cycle of shelters,

757
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.120
dark allies, and drugs.

758
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:54.010
As an example, the culture of the ‘houseboy’
had been a staple of the gay community, and

759
00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:58.890
to some, an indication of status and success.

760
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:03.980
Wealthy gays taking on young gay men, offering
room and board in exchange for eye candy,

761
00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.450
performing household chores, and sexual favours.

762
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:14.010
The latter of which would often be extended
to friends and guests, at the patron’s whim.

763
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:21.740
The end result was a socially-accepted precedence
for a power dynamic that exploited vulnerability.

764
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:28.680
That isn’t to say that all those who provided
shelter to younger gay men were predatory.

765
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:34.740
That also isn’t to say that all of these
arrangements violated consent.

766
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.900
But the fact that it was so accepted as status-quo
is what should be troubling.

767
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:44.490
But the power dynamic within the culture certainly
made for an enticing opportunity for some

768
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:52.260
— to match the monstrous elements of themselves
with the perceived success that home-cleaning

769
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.650
concubines indicated to other queers.

770
00:54:55.650 --> 00:55:02.140
We may never know the degree of exploitation
that has occurred within this very community.

771
00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:08.800
Because there are good Samaritans in the world,
who do aim for the comfort of others.

772
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:14.990
But for each one of these, how many are there
who get drunk off of having a desperate boy

773
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:16.500
at their mercy?

774
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.970
The monster, after all, does not know it is
a monster.

775
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:26.810
A monster is as they have always been: they
do what is natural to them.

776
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:32.520
And it is those outside who place labels on
the monster.

777
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:39.190
Or, are we so desperate to live out these
monster fables that we seek them out?

778
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:46.020
We want to be both damsels in need of rescue,
and also chrome-clad knights.

779
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:52.050
And it may not be the princess or Prince we
want to save from the monster, but the monster

780
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.460
from itself.

781
00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.780
Through the process of wanting to redeem the
monster in ourselves, we may seek out other

782
00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:06.420
monsters who neither see the need for their
own redemption nor do they feel that they

783
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.220
do anything requiring redemption.

784
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:16.230
With them we remain, sinking into habits and
patterns, where their monstrous behaviour

785
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:20.480
becomes our normal over time.

786
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.180
And those watching us simply cannot understand
why.

787
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:30.840
This is by no way something only present in
queer circles, but we tend to frame our lives

788
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.200
in ways that mimmic the media we watch.

789
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.750
We see these squabbles, these fights, these
struggles play out over a few seasons of television,

790
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.580
or over the course of a film.

791
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:49.680
We feel this immense fulfilment over seeing
a satisfying conclusion, over the resolution

792
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.670
of drama, the poetic justice of everyone finally
understanding your side of the story, after

793
00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:01.520
the evil monster is recognized as a sympathetic
man.

794
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:08.990
And everyone just decides to forgive and forget
the ways they hurt others.

795
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:11.310
But Real life doesn’t have a plot.

796
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:16.150
Real life does not have a resolution and nor
will there ever be.

797
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.160
Not as we’d understand it.

798
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:25.970
So our attempts to find meaning and significance
in what happens is a matter of us superimposing

799
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:32.340
our own understanding of literary devices
and dramatic licence upon the events that

800
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.790
happen around us in real life.

801
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:43.390
And always in a way which feed into our own
story, our own character development.

802
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:50.830
And some of us want our story to be about
turning the beast into a prince.

803
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:56.990
I can’t think of a single queer person who
has not gone through some kind of abusive

804
00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:02.750
relationship – and that’s even outside
our garden-variety trauma.

805
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:09.850
We all have that one ex who, if they didn’t
outright abuse us, treated us like they were

806
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.550
the most important thing in our lives.

807
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.820
Like we couldn't exist without them.

808
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.310
Some of us have more than one, of course.

809
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.280
And yet… we all know exactly why we stuck
around for so long.

810
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.100
Why we tolerated the behaviour, the treatment.

811
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.280
Because the alternative was being alone.

812
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:37.250
The alternative was not being understood.

813
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:45.380
Even if the alternative was not explicit rejection,
maybe it’s just as bad to earn indifference.

814
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.820
And regardless of the behaviour…

815
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.910
That one person ‘got’ you.

816
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.570
They understood you.

817
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:55.690
In fact, that kind of emotional proximity
is exactly why they were able to twist you

818
00:58:55.690 --> 00:59:00.420
around the rusty nails they pounded into your
heart.

819
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:07.820
They knew where your heart was… when nobody
else cared enough to look for it.

820
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.760
And leaving them?

821
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:14.270
Even if you did find somebody else… would
they ever understand you the way the monster

822
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:16.800
had?

823
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:23.160
Human survival has depended on establishing
connections with others.

824
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:29.740
So how can anyone say that it’s your fault
for craving that connection with a monster

825
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:38.400
over no connection at all?

826
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.510
So much of queer horror is about the aspects
of our culture that straight people fear,

827
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:49.120
that straight society fears: women's strength
and independence, men's vulnerability and

828
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:55.680
intimacy, the upending of gender and family
roles, the rejection of the primacy of reproduction,

829
00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.630
the hollowness and bankruptcy of the dominant
social structures, and challenges to the Church's

830
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.200
pronouncements.

831
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.960
And our inherent invisibility, our cunning—that
we might be anyone, anywhere, lurking in plain

832
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960
sight.

833
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.610
I have to confess, there's something delectable
about the fact that we would cause so much

834
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:23.200
anxiety, and anguish, and unreasonable, unwarranted
fear simply by existing.

835
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.840
There seems to be great power in that.

836
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.120
Aside from the obvious, what are queer people
terrified of?

837
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:37.180
Of course, we are scared of death, as well
as violence, torture, sickness, and suffering,

838
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:41.520
as well as being exposed, humiliated, shunned,
and persecuted.

839
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.590
We are concerned about being erased, unseen,
or forgotten.

840
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.860
We're terrified of being alone.

841
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:54.270
But being queer is sometimes about all of
those things; they are at the heart of our

842
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:57.260
history and the source of our oppression.

843
01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:03.230
Being queer sometimes means being cast out;
other times, it means casting ourselves out,

844
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:09.540
walking or running away from abusive families
and partners while we still can.

845
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:13.580
Being queer sometimes means being the sympathetic
beast.

846
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.850
Frankenstein’s monster.

847
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.280
Just yearning to be left alone.

848
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.090
To live our lives.

849
01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:24.820
Depending upon where in the world you live
being queer can mean losing your family, your

850
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.900
friends, your religion.

851
01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:31.240
The pillars of society that held you up and
now you’re left alone, forced to fight for

852
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.700
yourself because sometimes no one else is
willing to fight for you.

853
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:40.190
Like the victim of a slasher movie, you’ve
watched as everything and everyone you held

854
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.770
dear drops around you.

855
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.720
But there’s strength there.

856
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:53.550
Because sometimes, after everything and everyone
has been stripped from us, sometimes being

857
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:58.099
queer means being the last one standing.
