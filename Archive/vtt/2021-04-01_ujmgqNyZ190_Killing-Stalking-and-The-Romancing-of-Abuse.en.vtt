parties
alright now on with the show

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.559
so if you're anything like i was circa
six weeks ago

12
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.760
you're probably thinking what the hell
is killing stalking

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.120
i too was one so naive you see the day i
released the power couple video i got an

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.719
emergency call to come home because my
mom was in the hospital

15
00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.000
home for me is a five-hour drive away so
instead of premiering the video as

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.440
planned i just
set it to live jumped in my car and

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560
drove
my mom pulled through thank god but it

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.720
was pretty touch and go
for a while so as i waited in the

19
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.159
hospital and in my hotel room
i started checking the comments on the

20
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.600
power couple video
lots of love which i definitely needed

21
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.119
right then
but there were also a few people

22
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.880
absolutely
haranguing me because they thought the

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.040
couple in the video's thumbnail wasn't
wiccan and hulkling from marvel comics

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.079
the subject of the video
but yoon bom and songwo and they were

25
00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.159
absolutely furious
that i would have the gall to portray

26
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.960
them in any kind of positive light
and all i could think was who the hell

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.720
are you in bomb and song woah
if i wasn't already in such an emotional

28
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.600
state i would have
ignored the comments as simply being

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.640
misinformed
but they were calling me out on a bad

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.479
day so i decided
i'd better do some research so i used

31
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.920
the hotel's
honestly shockingly good wi-fi to hop

32
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.920
onto the good old google.com and look up
songwoo and yoon bom this is when i came

33
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.800
across the korean web comic
killing stalking and right below that in

34
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.160
the google search in the people also ask
section

35
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.760
was the question does song songwoo love
yoon bom

36
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.319
oh they're gay let's investigate
now because i'm a good law-abiding

37
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.280
citizen who would
nev ever ever pirate something

38
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.959
i hunted around online for the books of
killing stalking which i was seeing

39
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.440
described as a psychological romance
romantic thriller and dark romance

40
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.440
but try as i might no online bookstore
would sell me an english version of the

41
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.280
comic
french spanish italian german polish and

42
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.519
korean versions were plentiful
and even available with prime shipping

43
00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.480
but
nothing in english fine

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.840
i'll do the bad thing and read it online

45
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.480
well [ __ ] so because i had nothing
better to do than

46
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.319
sit in hospital rooms and hotel rooms i
read the whole thing in two or three

47
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.040
days
all 67 issues multiple special issues

48
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.840
holiday issues and author notes
and it was good a dark psychological

49
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.760
thriller about loneliness
trauma and severe abuse closer to a

50
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.480
horror novel than a thriller right in my
wheelhouse

51
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.159
but then i thought back to how i'd seen
it described online

52
00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:43.280
dark yes psychological yes thriller
yes a romance

53
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.360
it had always been described as a
romance

54
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.040
who the hell was describing this as a
romance

55
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.319
according to the internet um
a lot of people which suddenly i

56
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.840
understood why some commenters were so
angry that they thought i'd used an

57
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.120
image
of this couple and put power couple

58
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.439
beside it
and because i'm never one to turn down

59
00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.239
making a mistake i decided to dive deep
into the killing stalking fandom which

60
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.720
has a surprisingly large presence on
tiktok

61
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.639
personally i'd love the series it was
something akin to jillian flynn novels

62
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.040
stories about extremely flawed
emotionally broken people

63
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.360
but what i saw online was a community
obsessed with the romance

64
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.040
between the two lead characters the
emotionally stunted yoon bomb

65
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.800
and the serial killer he's infatuated
with songwo

66
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.240
now before we talk about why looking at
their relationship as anything even

67
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.800
close to a romance is wrong let's go
over the plot of the series

68
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:57.840
so that you know what i'm talking about

69
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:17.300
[Music]

70
00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.960
yoon bom is a depressed 20-something
who's had a pretty hard life

71
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.880
having lost his parents at a young age
he's been brought up by his grandmother

72
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.080
and abusive uncle
he was drafted into the korean military

73
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.800
military services compulsory in south
korea

74
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.000
and despite his frail body and
psychological instability

75
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.440
he's still forced to serve while in
training camp

76
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.520
he becomes the target of other recruits
who accuse him of being gay and make fun

77
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.360
of him for looking like a girl
in one such altercation his attackers

78
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.080
are just about to rape him
when he's rescued by another recruit a

79
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.639
handsome young man a few years his
junior

80
00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.240
songwo ever since then yoon bomb has
become

81
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.800
infatuated with songwoo after both
completed their term of duty he began

82
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.960
following him around finding out where
he lived

83
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.319
and even figuring out the security code
to his house based on which buttons

84
00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.520
looked to be pushed the most
yoonbom essentially becomes the stocking

85
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.000
in killing stalking one day he manages
to actually get into the house

86
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.080
though he's almost thwarted by a police
drive-by once inside the house he's

87
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.319
almost
euphoric to be in sangwo's private space

88
00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.560
he has a look around but starts to hear
noises from the basement

89
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.479
he goes down partially hoping to find
songwo but is shocked

90
00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.720
to find a mutilated young woman tied up
and screaming for help

91
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.440
but when he takes off her blindfold she
screams for him to stay away

92
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.800
bomb hasn't noticed that seongwo has
snuck up behind him

93
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.240
having been told that someone was in his
house by the police outside

94
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.880
one of those officers by the way
believes that seongwoo killed his own

95
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.319
parents but we'll get to that later
so songwoo smashes bomb over the head

96
00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.160
with a bat
he tries to escape but can't get past

97
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.120
the much larger song wow and so
in an act of panic he professes his love

98
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.599
for him
telling him that he's been in love with

99
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:19.360
him for years ever since the military
songwo seems to calm down with this and

100
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.039
even invites him upstairs
when yoon bomb asks if he's been

101
00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.440
forgiven for breaking into his house
sangwo says yes

102
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.400
but not with his legs in that state
eventually destroying bomb's ankles with

103
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.000
a sledgehammer
and here in this dark basement guest

104
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.960
starring a soon-to-be corpse
is where the love story of songwoo and

105
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.400
yoon bomb begins
it's not problematic at all but when bum

106
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.120
wakes up now chained next to the girl
who is now dead by the way songwo

107
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.800
confesses that although he kills women
on the regular he hasn't killed a man

108
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.240
since his father
he starts force-feeding yoon bomb some

109
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.400
sort of porridge gruel before leaning in
and kissing him and bomb instead of

110
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.400
fearing for his life which would
you know be understandable in the

111
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:13.360
situation wonders to himself
does this mean we're dating

112
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.280
so after an unspecified amount of time
chained up in the basement assuming

113
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.240
weeks
songwood decides it's time to bathe bomb

114
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.479
bath bomb to wash him
once he's all clean and now dressed in

115
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.360
girl's clothing
songwoo tells him that he's going to let

116
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.360
him live under two conditions
he never passes the threshold of the

117
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.560
stairs at the house entrance
and he has to do all the cooking

118
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.640
cleaning and other housework
essentially bomb under pain of death is

119
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.360
made into songwoo's mother
but bomb needs to eat off of a plate on

120
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.160
the floor
presumably because sangwo doesn't want

121
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.279
to humanize him too much
and sangwo watches him like a hawk even

122
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.839
when he's on the floor eating
just waiting for him to make a mistake

123
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:59.440
any mistake
so that he can physically assault him

124
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.040
and he does
on multiple occasions no offense is too

125
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.880
slight to bring on the wrath of songwoo
eventually song woah with science bummed

126
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.720
the task of organizing a collection of
shelves in the storage room

127
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.920
while doing so bum finds a bottle of rat
poison

128
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.160
and gets the idea to put it into sango's
food he'll be fine because

129
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.320
song won't ever lets him eat at the
table let alone the same food as him

130
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.000
but not that night no sangwo invites him
up to the big boy table

131
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.560
and bomb is forced to eat first which
makes him violently ill

132
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.320
later that night when bomb is done
throwing his guts up seong-wo actually

133
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.560
lays him down on his own bed
and here we discover that song was

134
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.839
father was incredibly abusive
particularly to his mother

135
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:47.040
and would force the two of them to eat
off of the floor

136
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.399
just like he was making bomb do but just
in case you thought the author was

137
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:53.760
humanizing songwoo in some way
he then follows up his confession by

138
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.160
telling bomb that he hates people like
him

139
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.360
people who are always complaining about
their lot in life

140
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.880
that he has no sympathy for broken
people

141
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.959
that they're useless but for one thing

142
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.200
and then we find out what that one thing
is with an insanely awkward sex scene

143
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.279
that is despite what many fans think
rape the power dynamic between the two

144
00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.399
is too vast
song wow has far too much control over

145
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:24.399
bomb for to not be rape
sorry shippers this isn't a loving sex

146
00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.920
scene it is sexual assault where the
aggressor is a serial killer and the

147
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:35.920
victim is psychologically underdeveloped
this is not romantic

148
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.240
anyway bum continues to do everything
he's told creating a bond of trust with

149
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040
songwoo
leading to songwoo one day saying that

150
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.360
he needs to go out for a little while
bomb immediately decides this is the

151
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.279
time for him to make his escape
he changes his clothes he passes the

152
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:57.680
threshold and approaches the door
but then he stops and starts thinking

153
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.120
yes life with song wo is pretty terrible
but he hasn't been so bad since they had

154
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.760
sex
not nice by any means but not terrible

155
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.600
but if bomb escapes and goes home he'll
be left at the mercy of his abusive

156
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.320
uncle who
we've now discovered has been raping

157
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.440
bomb since he was a child
but at least then he'd have a modicum of

158
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.000
freedom
and so he opens the door smelling fresh

159
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.959
air for the first time in months
but sitting on the stoop waiting for him

160
00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:31.519
is songwoo
this was a test you see a test that bomb

161
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:36.240
has failed
and so songwa assaults him leaving him a

162
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.279
bloody mess in the street all the while
laughing and yelling

163
00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:46.320
somebody save him but nobody comes
this area is mostly deserted it's a bad

164
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.680
area of town
bomb can yell and yell but no one will

165
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.120
save him
songwoo takes him back into the house

166
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.959
throws him back into the basement
and tortures him in a scene that would

167
00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:00.639
feel at home in saw
now as i mentioned earlier one of the

168
00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:03.760
police officers we met in the first
issue has been looking into sangwo

169
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.720
because he's thoroughly convinced that
he killed his parents

170
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.079
the details around their deaths are just
too sketchy this has been

171
00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:14.079
running throughout the series by the way
he eventually decides it's time to

172
00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:16.720
investigate sangwo's house and does a
walk through

173
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.399
he looks everywhere but doesn't find any
evidence of foul play

174
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:24.480
he also doesn't find bomb which song
won't notices

175
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.639
once the officer leaves still very
suspicious songwell flies into a fit of

176
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.639
rage
convinced that bomb used this

177
00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:34.000
opportunity to flee
he searches the house the basement

178
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.200
outside and he can't find him anywhere
but once back in the house he finds bomb

179
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.240
on the floor
he's been hiding from the cop he grabs

180
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.120
him you're in tears
saying they're going to be together

181
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.200
forever in fact songwoo decides it's
time to win bomb over

182
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.880
so he gives him some crutches since
bomb's ankles are still wrecked

183
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.920
and takes him shopping for new clothes
at one point bomb is actually alone in

184
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.040
the store
this is a public mall he's got the

185
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.079
chance to escape
he can approach a security guard he can

186
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:10.399
call 9-1-1 this
is his chance

187
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:18.160
but instead he starts to panic
and looks for songwoo instead stop

188
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.560
okay that's enough synopsis sizing for
now we need to talk about

189
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.560
stockholm syndrome this term is thrown
around a lot

190
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.600
and most cops and even psychologists
question

191
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.200
its validity whether or not it even
exists but

192
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.120
in my opinion killing stalking is a
textbook case

193
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.079
of stockholm syndrome in theory at least
the term originates from a bank robbery

194
00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:46.639
in stockholm sweden in 1973.
john eric olsen took four employees

195
00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:50.079
hostage during the robbery
and held them captive for six days in

196
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.600
one of the bank's vaults
when finally released none of the

197
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.079
captives would testify against olson
instead they began raising money for his

198
00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:01.680
defense fund
their sudden connection with the captor

199
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.399
became popularly known as
stockholm syndrome the symptoms of which

200
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:09.360
are
perceiving kindness or compassion from

201
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.199
the captor or abuser
developing positive feelings toward the

202
00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:16.240
individual or group holding you captive
or abusing you

203
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:22.000
adopting the same goals world view and
ideology as your captor or abusers

204
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.040
feeling
pity toward those abusing you refusing

205
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.000
to leave them even when given the
opportunity to escape

206
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.600
having negative perceptions towards
police family friends and

207
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.720
anyone else who may try to help you
escape the situation

208
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.160
and refusing to assist police and
government authorities in prosecuting

209
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.240
the perpetrators of abuse or kidnapping
people like to throw around this

210
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.160
diagnosis for a lot of things
like disney's beauty and the beast where

211
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.639
it 100 percent is
not applicable but here it 100 percent

212
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:55.199
is yoonbomb hits every single one of the
diagnostic triggers for

213
00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:59.120
stockholm syndrome he feels songwoo is
being compassionate toward him when he

214
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.079
so much as
lets him eat he not only develops

215
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:05.680
positive feelings for song wo but
fulon falls in love with him at least he

216
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.120
believes he does
he helps songwoo to commit murders and

217
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.120
even dispose of bodies
he feels pity for songwoo after finding

218
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.680
out about his abusive childhood
he eventually won't run away given the

219
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.120
chance sure his first attempt failed
but what about in the mall and multiple

220
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.079
other instances during the series
he's suspicious of the police officer

221
00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:31.600
trying to help him
and finally he refuses to assist the

222
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.560
police when given the opportunity to do
so

223
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.519
eventually the story moves on to the
point where the police officer has

224
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.680
gotten enough evidence he believes
to arrest and convict songwo for murder

225
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.199
and kidnapping
he brings both songwoo and yoon bomb to

226
00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:49.440
the police station
but yoon bum won't say a bad word about

227
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.639
songwo
he's the only witness they've got and he

228
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:57.199
won't say a thing
especially after seong-wo declares to

229
00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:02.720
the police station that he and bomb
are a couple that he loves him

230
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.959
this declaration sends baum into a
euphoric tailspin

231
00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:11.440
resulting in him agreeing with
everything sangwo says

232
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.800
refusing to cooperate with the police
and eventually the police dropping all

233
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.240
possible charges
even after songwoo tells him that he was

234
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.880
just lying to get the cops off of his
back

235
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.800
yoonbom holds on to the original
declaration of love

236
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.639
that's what he wants to remember and so
that's what he will remember

237
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:33.279
as the series progresses we get deeper
and deeper into the supremely

238
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:38.800
toxic relationship between these two men
it becomes clear if it wasn't already

239
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.639
that both are
mentally ill yoonbomb has severe

240
00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:45.759
depression
anxiety and abandonment issues while

241
00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:50.480
senwo is a narcissistic psychopath
he has a very high opinion of himself

242
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.279
and anyone who isn't him is basically
scum

243
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:57.360
tools to be used by him until they're no
longer useful to him

244
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.399
and that's what unbomb becomes to him a
tool

245
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:05.839
especially for sex these sex scenes are
violent disturbing and painful to read

246
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:10.079
it's honestly very hard to believe that
certain fans think that they were

247
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.919
written to be romantic
yoonbam begins to represent songwoo's

248
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:18.240
mother in more ways than one as well
not only does he care for songwoo in a

249
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.600
motherly way
but in a series of flashbacks we also

250
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.640
learn that sangwo's mother sexually
molested him as a child

251
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.160
and so his now regular sex with yoon
bomb is a continuation of the

252
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.559
relationship with his mother
this drawn connection between yoon bomb

253
00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:35.679
and sangwo's mother
eventually becomes a source of anxiety

254
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.880
for him though
you see songwo's mother was actually the

255
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.799
one who killed his father
he didn't do it his mother did but in a

256
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:46.400
blatant act of gaslighting she convinced
her son that he killed him

257
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.640
in a fit of paranoia his mother decided
that sangwo needed to die as well

258
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.480
and so she tried killing him with the
very rat poison that yoon bomb attempted

259
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.440
to kill him with early on in the series
seong-wo eventually discovered this and

260
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.840
killed her
arguably in self-defense and so the

261
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.080
people he trusted most in his life
his mother and his father both betrayed

262
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.880
him in one way or another
and now near the end of the series he

263
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.440
fears that yoon bomb will do the same
thing

264
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.360
after an injury leaves him unable to
leave the house he's forced to rely on

265
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.400
yoonbomb to do the grocery shopping and
run errands

266
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.600
convinced that yoon bomb is either going
to run away

267
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.160
or kill him bum never does though
but the paranoia remains during this

268
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.559
time the
police officer who had been trying to

269
00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:39.360
bring songwoo down has been having
more or less a mental breakdown but a

270
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.799
confluence of events gets him
back into the case leading into a

271
00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:46.799
violent confrontation between himself
and songwa when songwa is restrained

272
00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:50.799
he calls for yunbom to get the knife
that he dropped and kill the cop

273
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:56.720
to save him bomb gets the knife
but can't do it he lets it clatter to

274
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.440
the floor
song wow is shocked looks at bomb and

275
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.600
says
simply i don't need you anymore

276
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.320
the cop orders bomb to run away once out
in the pouring rain he stands outside

277
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.840
looking at the house that's been his
home and prison for god only knows how

278
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.799
long
inside the battle continues and thanks

279
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:21.200
to a gas stove and a lighter
an explosion rips through the building

280
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.720
yoonbom is taken to the hospital
where he recovers from his multiple

281
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.840
wounds when he gets out he goes in
search of sangwo

282
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.000
who last he'd heard was alive in another
hospital here we learned that sango is

283
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.360
dead
not from his injuries but by being

284
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.559
smothered by another patient she
couldn't

285
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:42.480
handle his mumbling through the bandages
day and night

286
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:50.320
all the time calling out bomb's name
the series ends with yoonbomb seeing who

287
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.400
he thinks is song while
even though he's dead and running into

288
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.799
traffic
to chase after him

289
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.960
[Music]
when it comes to doing an analysis of

290
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.919
killing stalking we're going to run into
some problems

291
00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:13.039
what's the subtext that the author is
trying to get across

292
00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:16.080
what are we intended to come away with
does it even matter

293
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.919
do the author's intentions matter how
much context is needed for killing

294
00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.159
stalking
and what is meant to be just taken at

295
00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:26.080
face value
i for one find it very unsettling that

296
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.080
it's perceived as romantic
not only by the shippers by the way but

297
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.720
also by
a great many people who read the comic

298
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.880
and do understand that it's toxic
alright so if it's not a romance what is

299
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.960
it it's a horror thriller
obviously this isn't even a

300
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.520
psychological thriller this is full-on
horror

301
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.360
song wow is closer to jigsaw than
hannibal lecter there are a few other

302
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.600
themes that
the work might be trying to talk about

303
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.960
as well treatment or dismissal of the
mentally ill

304
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.640
the dangers of a culture which thrives
on obsession this is coming from the

305
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.400
land of k-pop after all
and the negative effects of compulsory

306
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.480
military service though i can't speak to
the reality in south korea

307
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.919
in north america mental illness is
absolutely treated as something for

308
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.640
which you
might see a psychologist a handful of

309
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.640
times where you'll eventually be put on
meds and never checked in on again

310
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.360
and that's if your insurance even covers
it i have a pretty good job and it still

311
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.280
only covers two psych visits a year
the mental wellness institution as a

312
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.679
whole generally doesn't much care about
you

313
00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:29.679
yoonbom gets the overarching diagnosis
of borderline personality disorder

314
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:34.799
because he obsesses over people and then
he's just tossed out into the street

315
00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:38.480
it really resonates with how i see the
system failing people

316
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.480
with mental illness in the real world
every single day

317
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.000
not to mention that in spite of his
history of mental illness he is drafted

318
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.919
for service in the korean military
because instead of treating people and

319
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.880
offering them the strategies and coping
mechanisms they need

320
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.559
we're going to isolate them in an
environment that is built to withhold

321
00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.440
special treatment
in order to foster an environment of

322
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.919
conformity at which point killing
stocking

323
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:05.120
asks a very strange question of the
reader

324
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.520
to discern where individual decisions
begin and where societal familial

325
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.440
conditioning ends
at what point is a toxic individual a

326
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.919
failure of a society at large
and at what point should we start

327
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:27.840
judging them
for their own actions

328
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.200
anytime we analyze a story that is at
all left open for interpretation

329
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.480
there are going to be people who
disagree with your take on it and just

330
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.240
yell
you just don't get it now i don't think

331
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.200
there actually are multiple ways of
looking at killing stalking

332
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.280
it's a horror story not a romance but a
lot of people are

333
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.480
coming away seeing it as a romance so
is there interpretation wrong

334
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.679
yes but let's pretend it's not let's
pretend

335
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:02.240
that this story's themes are vague and
look at it alongside some other works of

336
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.240
art that people disagree on
art is in the eye of the beholder after

337
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.159
all is killing stocking a
surface beauty and the b style romance

338
00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:15.120
where the monster can change in the end
or is it as i believe an analysis of

339
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.400
trauma and abuse
granted there have been any number of

340
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.200
times when an audience especially an
academic one

341
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.960
falls into the trap of just assuming
that everything is deeper than it really

342
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.080
is
in fact in some cases people read into a

343
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.880
work of fiction to find layers
when there are none intended just to

344
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.799
justify their appreciation of it
but even when things aren't done to

345
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:40.559
deliberately troll
intellectuals there's a trend of

346
00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:44.559
intellectuals
taking a body of work and saying well if

347
00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:48.960
this play is deep
then they all must be deep like half of

348
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.720
shakespeare if not
more is that a hot take not not really

349
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.679
like come on
the man wrote almost 40 plays in 20

350
00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:58.559
years you can't expect
every one of them to have a nuanced

351
00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:02.240
insightful world vision
he had to put food on the table for him

352
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.760
and his troop of actors and his
boyfriend he was a businessman before he

353
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.360
was a creator
most of what he wrote was on commission

354
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.799
that doesn't mean that
hamlet or macbeth aren't excellent

355
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:18.000
expressions of literary subtlety
but there isn't much that's subtle about

356
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.679
titus andronicus
where the hero takes the two sons of the

357
00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:24.720
villain bakes them into a pie and feeds
them to her

358
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.720
it's basically shakespeare's slasher
movie which

359
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.240
that's why it's my favorite shakespeare
play and the biggest fallacy of his

360
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.400
career was that romeo and juliet
arguably his most iconic work

361
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.440
wasn't meant to be a classic
like big shock time all those guys in

362
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.640
high school english who
gagged at the gratuitous romance in the

363
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.159
play who were
dismissed by the english teacher were

364
00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:51.919
actually right
see aside from the fact that this is a

365
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:55.120
grotesque amount
of romance that chokes out what little

366
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.600
plot actually exists in romeo and juliet
there are a number of dated cultural

367
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.320
contexts that highlight that this
is a relationship shakespeare would have

368
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.760
considered toxic
taking this into consideration it

369
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.400
becomes a cautionary tale
juliet referring to her love as being in

370
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.880
excess was a key feature
elizabethan england was stuck in a bit

371
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.480
of an austerity kick
where modernity and temperance were

372
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.279
strongly valued anything in excess
was seen as dysfunctional so the fact

373
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:29.600
that they both die at the end
really should have been a tip-off

374
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.360
shakespeare was probably thinking
the fact that their affair leads to both

375
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.880
of their deaths
should tell audiences that this is a bad

376
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.240
nobody's going to find death romantic
romeo and juliet therefore should not be

377
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.440
viewed as a romance but a satire
a parody of romance and romantic plays

378
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.039
i'm sure most people are more accustomed
to hearing about satire and parody when

379
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:56.960
it's
comedic which it is much easier to make

380
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.240
a clear thematic satire when it comes to
comedy

381
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.760
but satire is just a matter of pushing a
medium into the territory of the

382
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.840
carnivalesque
actions decisions reactions and elements

383
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.520
of design
and theme are so absurd that they reach

384
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.480
a point where it's impossible to take
them seriously

385
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.080
at least that's the idea satire is
usually comedy because if you're trying

386
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.320
to defame the nazis
it's easy to do so by making them look

387
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.400
like fools because you're simply taking
elements of how they already were

388
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.159
foolish in history
and amplifying it sometimes you can get

389
00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:35.840
away with being honest in comedic satire
because the events that you were making

390
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.600
fun of
really were that ridiculous and

391
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.200
sometimes you have to tone it back or
people will think it's too over the top

392
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.360
stalin is invincible the force of [ __ ]
death back to the salt mine what's

393
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.919
happening
this is impossible and

394
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:58.240
maybe he's appointing his successor a
drawback to this

395
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.480
is that it's not always entirely clear
what is being made fun of this

396
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.760
is especially true in absurdist or
ironic depictions

397
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.760
is south park making fun of al gore
claiming that climate change is an

398
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.360
imaginary issue
or are they doing the opposite and

399
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.600
making fun of the people who
dismiss al gore saying that what they

400
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.559
imagine
al gore acts like isn't the reality of

401
00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:26.399
how he portrays himself
and for reference south park's defenders

402
00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:29.919
often do use the you just don't get a
defense when it comes to criticisms

403
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:34.720
directed at them
and they do tend to cross the line every

404
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.360
once in a while but this video is not
about south park

405
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.799
satire can also be dramatic though this
is

406
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:46.720
less common in modern media however
here we take culture and history and

407
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.080
rather than amplify the ridiculousness
take elements of violence bigotry

408
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.559
romance political ideology or even
culture itself

409
00:27:56.559 --> 00:28:00.240
and bring the real life absurdity to the
audience's attention

410
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.720
the hope is for these themes to be read
as societal problems

411
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.960
a downside to this is that the line
between satire and reverence is

412
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.360
very narrow was stanley kubrick
presenting a horrifying depiction of

413
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.120
psychological conditioning trauma and
groupthink as it exists in the american

414
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.480
military and full metal jacket
i mean that's probably how he intended

415
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.039
it
but if you're an individual who values

416
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:29.279
elements of hyper masculinity
pro-violence and american imperialism

417
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:33.200
then you can just as easily see full
metal jacket as a shining testament to

418
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.200
an era when men were men
and weak undeserving men simply snapped

419
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.039
under the pressure in which
real men persisted as for what kubrick

420
00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:45.200
intended
it's a little bit difficult to gauge he

421
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.120
offered phenomenally little information
about what his films were intended to

422
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.960
really be about
he liked to see them as a litmus test

423
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.120
which had more to say about the observer
depending upon how they would interpret

424
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.159
the film this is epitomized in his final
film

425
00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:05.039
eyes wide shut which is about

426
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.080
something even when some of us think
there's no way

427
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.880
someone could have positive
interpretations of a work there is

428
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.840
someone who's going to read a clockwork
orange and think

429
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.520
yeah that's what masculinity means and
the government is the villain

430
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.559
because they they brainwashed him out of
his individuality

431
00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:27.039
but in instances like kubrick's nuanced
vagueness

432
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:30.399
can we really use intention as a means
to

433
00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:35.360
analyze works of fiction all this is to
say that i'm taking an analysis of

434
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.000
killing stalking very seriously
and even though my focus is as you might

435
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.679
have been able to tell
the audience's attitudes about it it's

436
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:48.640
important to know that
people can see art

437
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:55.840
in very different ways

438
00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:01.919
one of the most significant philosophies
of art criticism comes from jean

439
00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:05.840
boulliard
he argues in very generalized terms that

440
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.480
we
as a society have lost or are losing our

441
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.919
ability to tell the difference between
artifice and nature meaning

442
00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:17.200
we can't really see a clear difference
between a performance and an earnest

443
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.399
state of being
what is real and what is counterfeit and

444
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:22.960
to what degree can we tell the
difference between the two

445
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.039
this is more in the vein of say being
unsure if the kardashians or errant

446
00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:30.320
airheads
or whether this role is emphasized in

447
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.840
their programming in order to fulfill a
brand which

448
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.200
they use to solidify and expand their
platform

449
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.679
hey bestie this is especially true in
instances of long-spanning performance

450
00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:44.480
art
as you could see among lady gaga cher

451
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.279
madonna or
even people like ann coulter donald

452
00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:51.679
trump where the performance ends and the
individual begins and how much they

453
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:55.840
overlap are both
areas of debate an extrapolation of this

454
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.039
in the situation of killing stalking is
whether this is

455
00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:03.760
intended to be a work of fiction which
plays upon and subverts romantic tropes

456
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.840
or
whether it's earnestly romantic when i

457
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.200
read it i read a very conflicted horror
story where neither of the main

458
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.760
characters were particularly meant to be
admirable

459
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.440
and where the element of romance was
there to highlight the insidiousness of

460
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.559
song woo
and the dysfunction of yoonbom as this

461
00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:23.840
is a visual novel
meaning that the visual language is just

462
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.919
as important as the written text
there are a number of instances in the

463
00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:31.919
comic itself specific panels
which can be removed and shown as

464
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.279
romantic instances of cuddling hugging
and kissing

465
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:40.000
are all present granted this is usually
before or after someone is tortured or

466
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.159
killed
or buried very romantic but does this

467
00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:49.120
ability to separate these romantic
elements form a kind of phantom

468
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.080
plot in which the perceived romance runs
parallel to the actual depiction of the

469
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.679
toxic relationship
this could encourage someone to against

470
00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:00.240
all reason
deliberately read romance into

471
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.000
situations where there is none
this is to say nothing of the special

472
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.120
issues for christmas
and thanksgiving whereas songwoo and

473
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.760
yoonbomb are depicted romantically or
erotically and without any torture

474
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.399
except for the people that they are
murdering and disposing of but they're

475
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:17.120
doing it together
on one hand is this a matter of

476
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.000
depicting a relationship at peak
toxicity

477
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.080
or is this exploiting a will they want a
romantic format

478
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.799
to keep audiences tuned in for 67 issues
because in spite of these seemingly

479
00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:32.399
apparent layers
and the seemingly self-aware damnation

480
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:37.360
of its own content
killing stalking has acquired a certain

481
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.080
following in spite of the obvious or
what seems to me to be obvious messaging

482
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.440
about how
damaging and traumatic this relationship

483
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.880
is if you can even call it a
relationship which i don't

484
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.360
there is a swath of fans who lean toward
the will they won't they take

485
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.200
that this whole journey is a progressing
romance leading to seong wo

486
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.120
finally giving in to his feelings
stopping hurting yoon bomb

487
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.320
and then running off together with him
the torture has been

488
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.480
fantasized as a kind of love you to
death kind of thing

489
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.519
like songwa is so in love with yoonbomb
but the only way

490
00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:15.279
he knows how to express affection is
through abuse

491
00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:19.200
all sangwo needs to do is learn how to
properly

492
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.600
express his feelings of affection and
then everything will just turn out fine

493
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.440
being honest the implication throughout
the series is that seong-wo keeps

494
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.120
yoonbomb alive because he reminds him of
a maternal figure

495
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.880
which you'd think would lead an audience
to immediately connect him with norman

496
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.360
bates
well a boy's best friend is his mother

497
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.440
but they don't but maybe these people
haven't watched as many movies as i have

498
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.039
or
even the tv show bates motel so which is

499
00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:52.720
it gore porn
or star-crossed romance or a character

500
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.640
study of
stockholm syndrome we could look to the

501
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.440
author
who in front of every issue plasters a

502
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.200
big old disclaimer
that very explicitly says that this is a

503
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.760
depiction of abuse and dysfunction
which you know that must clear it up

504
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.000
right
done deal maybe because we're also in an

505
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.040
era of joanne
karen rowling prefacing everything with

506
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.200
i love the transsexuals but
this tactic is called dog whistling

507
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.800
which is doing or saying something
hateful but in a vague enough way that

508
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.639
you can credibly say
that's not what i was actually saying

509
00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:32.800
people who are racist and homophobic and
transphobic will be emboldened by the

510
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.760
message
and people who are indifferent or

511
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.200
centrist
will take it for granted as a joke and

512
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.560
even they themselves dismiss the haters
as social justice snowflakes in periods

513
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.480
past it was considered a point of pride
to clearly advocate for your beliefs

514
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.800
but these were also eras which had a
very clear hierarchy of privilege

515
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.200
and there was no shame in supporting the
hierarchy

516
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.200
today where the majority of progress is
dedicated to dismantling these systems

517
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.760
of privilege and oppression
there is an awareness of the right thing

518
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.800
to say
even if you don't necessarily believe it

519
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.960
indicative of the
i'm not racist but line that always is

520
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.599
followed by something racist
people want to be seen as

521
00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.839
progressive or at least on the right
side while still holding on to

522
00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:24.960
privileged attitudes and cultural
stereotypes

523
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.880
even bigoted people know how to properly
carry themselves in order to advance

524
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.680
their platform and not do or say
anything

525
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:37.839
too extreme in public
there's a reason the kkk wears hoods

526
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:40.400
much
in the same way that song wo knows how

527
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.000
to act like a normal person in society
so that he can blend in despite being

528
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.040
a crazed psychopath
i wasn't just comparing jk rowling to a

529
00:35:51.040 --> 00:36:00.560
psychopath what are you talking about
so the series is written by a korean

530
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.200
author and illustrator who goes by the
name of coogie

531
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.839
for whom there is next to no information
available online

532
00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:11.680
i did manage to track down and translate
an interview from 2018

533
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.200
where she was asked if there was any
sincere feeling of love between the two

534
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.040
lead characters
she responded it's up to the readers to

535
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.720
decide
if i have to decide then no okay but

536
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.240
it's a bit
odd that on every site where this is

537
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.680
available for purchase
or even for just reading it's listed as

538
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.280
a romance
on amazon it's even classified as lgbt

539
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.800
plus
marriage comedy she's also said that the

540
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.040
book should be categorized as a
psychological horror story and not

541
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.680
a romance of any kind though to be fair
if you visit her twitter the page is

542
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.520
mostly populated with romantic fan art
of yoon baum and songwell so where she

543
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.920
really stands on how the series should
be read

544
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.560
might be up for interpretation but let's
take her at her word in the 2018

545
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.599
interview
that she does not intend on this being

546
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:03.280
read as a romance in any way
then why does the fan base read it like

547
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.880
one and why
when i did my initial google search was

548
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.240
it so often described
as a psychological romance romantic

549
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.520
thriller dark romance
well there's two answers to that

550
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.040
question one
the fans are doing the categorizing two

551
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.160
publishing yes the archaic slowly dying
traditional publishing industry

552
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.680
which has real difficulty when it comes
to queer themes and books

553
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.520
especially involving men you see when a
book is being published

554
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.359
the publisher has to decide what kind of
categories the book falls into so that

555
00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.520
it can be marketed to the proper
audience

556
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.280
and when a book comes around with a gay
lead character who doesn't have a

557
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.200
romance in the plot
they have no idea how to classify it

558
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.280
women don't want to read a book about a
gay

559
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.640
straight men certainly don't want to
read a book about a gay gays barely want

560
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.119
to read a book about a gay
but a gay romance well according to

561
00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:59.359
market research women eat that
up so much so that it makes up for the

562
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:01.440
loss of a potential straight male
audience

563
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.960
gay readers don't really factor into the
thought process which is

564
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.320
a problem in itself and something i'll
cover in another video

565
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.920
and so we come to killing stalking is
this a romance

566
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.760
no even the author says so but are there
romantic elements

567
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.240
not really but could there maybe be
perceived romantic elements if you

568
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.000
tilt it the right way and read it under
a quarter moon during february of a leap

569
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.440
year
maybe sold into the m m romance category

570
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.520
you go
they don't just have to pick one

571
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.680
category though which is why
the much more applicable psychological

572
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.560
thriller and horror tags also get put on
there

573
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.920
so when readers are self-categorizing
the book online it becomes

574
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.000
a psychological romance romantic
thriller dark romance

575
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.280
so from the synopsis of killing stalking
i think it's pretty clear that both

576
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.760
characters yoon bom
and sangwo are not mentally stable

577
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.520
but in two very different directions
both of their lives have become

578
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.760
disasters since they were children with
abusive caregivers in both cases

579
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.960
that's why there is no romance in this
story

580
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.400
there's no actual love between these two
characters

581
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.560
yoon bomb thinks he loves song wou
because seongwoo rescued him from being

582
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.960
assaulted something that no one else has
ever done

583
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.720
not even his grandmother who seemingly
cared for him but

584
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.960
looked the other way when her son baum's
uncle would beat and rape him

585
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.079
and sengwo does not love yoonbomb
he uses him for sexual pleasure and his

586
00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:32.079
own emotional support but that's it
but you wouldn't think that by going

587
00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:36.320
over the comments online
many not all but many of the fans of

588
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.520
this series would have you believe that
it's a beauty and the beast style love

589
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.400
story
a tale as old as time that it's about

590
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.000
two lost souls finding each other and
helping each other become a whole

591
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.320
people if i've not yet made myself clear

592
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.440
that is not what this is about so why do
they think that

593
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.680
well yoon bomb isn't immediately killed
by song woah

594
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.520
unlike his other victims therefore this
must mean that he's special

595
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.680
this must mean that songwo cares for him
whether or not he's good at showing it

596
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.119
bomb should certainly stand out amongst
seong-wo's victims but that's because

597
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:15.839
he's a man
sangwo is a misogynistic sexual sadist

598
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:19.920
getting joy from torturing and murdering
women and because he is psychologically

599
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.520
damaged he essentially kills his mother
over and over and over and over again by

600
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.440
murdering women and then goes home to
his mother in the form of yoonbum

601
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.760
who he then assaults mentally and
physically just like his own father did

602
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.440
to his own mother
sometimes he has moments of clarity

603
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.599
where he realizes what he's doing
but they don't last long sometimes he'll

604
00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:44.319
even beg yoonbomb to not leave him
breaking down into tears but this is

605
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:48.720
simply emotional manipulation
he's using bomb's abandonment issues to

606
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.480
manipulate him into staying
we know this because when bomb drops the

607
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.160
knife during the final altercation
seong-wo tells him he doesn't need him

608
00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.640
anymore lashing out at him
and calling him down to the lowest so

609
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.000
what about yoonbom
he grew up being neglected by everyone

610
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.079
except his sexual abuse of uncle
who would tell him that he was gross

611
00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:12.240
disgusting
especially after raping him he was

612
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.839
socially awkward making it near
impossible for him to make friends

613
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:20.400
when people would start to get close to
him they'd be put off by how shy and

614
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.160
awkward he was
so when sangwo hugs him kisses him says

615
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.079
he loves him
says he'll be together forever even

616
00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:30.560
after crippling him choking him hanging
him and

617
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.880
cutting his throat just just deep enough
so that he won't bleed out

618
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.440
yoonbomb looks past the trauma and abuse
and just sees the affection

619
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.440
because it's the only affection he's
ever gotten from anyone

620
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.240
so he latches on to it even after he
knows that song wo is dead he can't let

621
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.119
go
and despite the fact that song won't

622
00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:53.520
never shows any unconditional kindness
to bomb

623
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.480
even insulting him when doing something
that could be characterized as kind

624
00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.960
some readers still look for a love story
they've taken an incredibly horrifying

625
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.520
twisted story of trauma and abuse
and twisted it further so that they can

626
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.720
ship it
they don't see it as a horror story and

627
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.520
hope for bomb to escape his monstrous
captor

628
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.839
they hope for songwo to declare his
undying love

629
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:21.200
they don't want sangwo to get arrested
for being a serial killer

630
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.480
they want the pair to ride off into the
sunset

631
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.800
this isn't two sad broken people who
have found each other and made each

632
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.720
other whole
this is a twisted psychopath

633
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.160
manipulating a poor lonely boy into
being his puppet

634
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.599
this is a story that warns us about the
effects of long-term abuse on two very

635
00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:45.520
different people
how sometimes lifelong trauma is

636
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.160
inescapable without a support system
killing stalking in my opinion is an

637
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.160
amazing psychological horror story
one that kept me swiping through those

638
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.680
pages unable to put it down
hoping that yoon bomb would escape that

639
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.800
seongwel would be caught that yoon bomb
would be rescued and

640
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:08.240
given the help that he needs and yet
there are masses of fans out there

641
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.160
who want them to get back together in
the end who flame the author online when

642
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:17.680
she ended the series with songwoo dead
the monster dies in the end he doesn't

643
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.400
transform into a handsome prince because
he always was

644
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:27.599
one but not all the glitters is gold
the fact that song wo looks like the man

645
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:30.079
of your dreams
is meant to show you that even the

646
00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:33.680
person you think is perfect
could be a monster underneath to watch

647
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.319
out for yourself to not
let yourself get trapped into this kind

648
00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:42.560
of traumatic relationship
the author has said in no uncertain

649
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.839
terms that she did not
intend this to be read as romantic

650
00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:51.359
despite her twitter feed
so why in seven hells

651
00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:58.960
are people especially teenage girls
reading this as a romance

652
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:01.839
well

653
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:09.839
because they've been raised too

654
00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:15.920
no beauty and the beast is not about
stockholm syndrome it's about a woman

655
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.200
who is forced into a castle and has to
work at making the monster she shares it

656
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.240
with
into a respectable human being for her

657
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.960
own sake
the original french folk tale functioned

658
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.240
as a way to ease young women into
accepting marriage arrangements

659
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.599
especially those in upper classes where
their husbands were

660
00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:36.000
usually the shining exemplars of wealthy
male privilege to the women

661
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.760
betrothed this seemed to be like an
awful proposition

662
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.599
and to ease them into it there needed to
be some kind of device that told them

663
00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:46.319
that it gets better
you know so they wouldn't kill

664
00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:50.720
themselves even if it was an errant lie
that sounds familiar so it's not like

665
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.920
the idea that a woman can change a man
is new

666
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.760
culture has been placing the onus on
women to be the active force in taking

667
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.599
control of men's behavior for
all of christianized european history if

668
00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:03.839
not longer and it's from this beauty and
the beast

669
00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:07.760
attitude that we get the idea that all a
woman needs to change her monstrous

670
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.000
romantic partner is a little elbow
grease

671
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.319
and so we end up here with killing
stalking which is neither an arranged

672
00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:19.280
marriage nor a heterosexual coupling
very 21st century at which point we are

673
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.160
at this weird junction where we're kind
of

674
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.200
pulled between seven different thought
processes about

675
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.800
cultural attitudes towards
representation romance gay men

676
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.400
femininity femininity in men
art criticism attitudes around common

677
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.359
sense the zeitgeist fandom social
connectivity and isolation mental health

678
00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:38.240
social
possibility

679
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.960
nobody should need to do this nobody
nobody should need to look at killing

680
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.359
stalking and say
well we need to know if the borderline

681
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:55.680
personality diagnosis was an
accurate one to say with confidence

682
00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:02.160
whether the author meant for this to be
read as erotic or not no

683
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.480
sangwo kills people he literally kills
people and not in a dark avenger

684
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.400
punisher kind of way he takes joy in
murdering people for fun

685
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.000
full stop and you and bob he's not
in love with song woo he just can't tell

686
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.280
the difference between love and abuse
if you read this and your first instinct

687
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.520
is to put these two
[ __ ] up people together for life there

688
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.359
is a problem
there is a problem with you there's a

689
00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:34.079
problem with our
culture i know from reading the comments

690
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:37.760
of killing stocking tick tock
compilations which are almost as

691
00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.359
unsettling as the source material that a
lot

692
00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:45.599
of the reader base are young women like
middle school

693
00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:49.280
they talk about reading it in class
hiding it from their teachers

694
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.359
even if you have experimented with
dating you have such a

695
00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:57.839
narrow concept of what it means to
actually be in a relationship at that

696
00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:00.240
age
you have no idea what functional

697
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.760
relationship even means
and trust me a lot of older people don't

698
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.359
know either this is not just an abusive
relationship

699
00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:10.400
this is an abusive relationship engaging
in

700
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.839
a carnival of over-the-top violence
gaslighting manipulation and rape

701
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:20.079
i am so unsettled thinking about how our
society

702
00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:24.240
is presenting a young generation with
such a twisted idea of romance

703
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.079
to the point where there is a shipping
community built around these two

704
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:32.240
[ __ ] because this isn't just killing
stalking

705
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.839
this didn't come out of nowhere it
wasn't straight from beauty and the

706
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:39.920
beast this
the pro-romance killing stalking fandom

707
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.520
is just the next logical step in the
evolution

708
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.760
of romanticizing abuse especially when
you've got twilight where edward and

709
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.960
bella's relationship ticks off
every single qualification of an abusive

710
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.760
relationship as qualified by social
workers

711
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.160
and still there is this paining over the
protagonists like

712
00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.160
this is a they're going to make it after
all love story about making things work

713
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.640
even if your parents in society don't
like it

714
00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.880
don't even get me started on 50 shades
of grey it was hyped up as this

715
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.880
racy sexy over-the-top intense sexual
romp through bdsm

716
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.040
and then i read it not knowing what the
hell the hype was about

717
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.319
because i'd read anne rice's sleeping
beauty series in junior high

718
00:48:20.319 --> 00:48:23.760
maybe a little too young but i was
mature for my age so in 50 shades women

719
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.200
kind of swoon over christian grey
even though he's obsessively controlling

720
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.200
anastasia he violates safe words meddles
in her personal life

721
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.800
and oversteps boundaries regularly and
the fans are all like

722
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.240
oh i invade my privacy heart or daddy
then you get things like

723
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.920
phantom of the opera which you know a
lot of

724
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.079
people read into the fact that the
phantom named eric is literally a psycho

725
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.920
who murders people and tries to lock up
his love interest christine

726
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.599
in a basement but in spite of this
you still get fans who drone on about

727
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.040
how christine was so dumb not to choose
eric because

728
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.800
eric was just so rally sexual
and overpowering and oh he really does

729
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.079
care underneath it all he threatened to
kill her oh but maybe he's good

730
00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:13.839
i read killing stalking as
an honest interpretation of these tropes

731
00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:17.359
which is a hell of a thing to do
subverting toxic literary tropes by

732
00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:19.839
confronting them with the reality of how
they function

733
00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:23.599
in real life the only difference is that
the author doesn't try to force a

734
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:29.680
romance into the text even if a huge
portion of her fans think that she

735
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.760
ruined the ending by probably killing
off the serial killer which is why they

736
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.680
fill her twitter timeline with fan art
of their preferred ending of these two

737
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.240
characters
christmases family reunions vacations

738
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.000
song wow a serial killer who killed
women to reenact killing his mother

739
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.920
over and over and over again finally
getting in touch with his feelings

740
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.240
realizing that he was gay all along and
taking it upon himself to cater to yoon

741
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.160
bomb's emotional needs
because no he's not gay it is stated in

742
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.599
the text and the author has stated he is
not gay he is a straight man who is

743
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:06.960
using yoonbomb
as a device for to fulfill his needs

744
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.240
and then the months that yoon bombs
spent locked in song most house and

745
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.599
basement with broken ankles
it's just a story to tell their adopted

746
00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:18.720
kids
but you know christian gray learns to

747
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.559
share the power dynamic and even sub for
anastasia in the end

748
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:26.160
and bella eventually gains the ability
to protect herself and thus

749
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.440
does not require edward to be so
obsessive belle's beast

750
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.040
turns into a man who made a whole
generation of people realize they

751
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.400
preferred furries eric the phantom
finally does learn to empathize with

752
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.119
someone else's needs and
lets christine go kind of not really

753
00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:44.720
there's a sequel called love never dies
don't watch it at which point it occurs

754
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.079
to me that it wasn't the romance in the
story that the fans fetishize

755
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:51.680
but the possibility of song wow changing
and becoming romantic

756
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.520
it's this yearning obsession for
redemption arc that the fans want

757
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.800
it's not even that the fandom is
choosing to overlook the abuse

758
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.440
and the violence and the murder the
fandom embraces all of this

759
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.680
it's just a part of the bumpy road on
the way to love

760
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.920
this is songwoo's journey this is
songwoo's redemption this is songwoo's

761
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.960
story
even though it's not the story is

762
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.319
explicitly framed from yoonbomb's point
of view and it's his

763
00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:22.400
emotions and struggles that drive the
plot sangwo at best

764
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.800
is an obstruction but should it be that
surprising that audiences are drawn to a

765
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.599
character who is depicted to be
attractive

766
00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:35.599
and nearly every review of the book
calls to attention just how hot he is i

767
00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.240
mean doesn't everyone want to be with
someone who's hot

768
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.000
what's a little character flaw like
psychopathy and murder

769
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.160
when you're sexy all of the fandom is
focused less around yoonbomb's

770
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.040
experience and more about how songwell
looks which a crowd of girls fawning

771
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.920
over attractive serial killers pleading
for his innocence isn't new

772
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.440
i find it weird that this audience is
simultaneously dismissive of yoon bomb

773
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.680
as a character
while at the same time fits into the

774
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.520
category of girls who fetishize gay
relationships

775
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.280
what's the thought process here are a
bunch of women

776
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.800
looking at a submissive gay man as a
cipher

777
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:21.440
their entry way into this relationship
or have they just kind of moved past the

778
00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:27.359
sadness of brokeback mountain and
the yearning of love simon and they need

779
00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:33.839
something a bit more
spicy for their gays now

780
00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:40.319
all of this makes me wonder

781
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.400
why did it need to be gay in the first
place was there anything said in this

782
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.000
comic that couldn't have been
conveyed if yoonbomb was a woman or even

783
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.760
if sangwo was a woman
were the sex scenes actually necessary

784
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.760
did they
fulfill a pivotal use in driving the

785
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:02.160
plot
character yes but were so many of them

786
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.200
necessary
maybe if yoon bomb was a woman the

787
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.599
author would have been more
sparing in their use of physical abuse

788
00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:12.559
maybe it would have hit too close to
home

789
00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:16.559
but by making bum a man it allows a
layer of disconnect

790
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:20.160
and all the major plot beats worth
talking about don't seem to include

791
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:25.359
any elements of sex whatsoever and it's
these sexual moments that the fans latch

792
00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:28.880
onto and say
yes the romance is real song wow just

793
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.559
needs a chance to open up
which even though the author won

794
00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:36.480
literary awards
in the category of horror thriller it

795
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.359
did go on to be
categorized as a romance did people

796
00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:44.800
pick it up expecting a romance and read
into it

797
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.640
or would they have seen that from the
very beginning

798
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.839
textually it does draw a thin line
between

799
00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:57.040
teasing unbomb with a romance and
teasing the audience

800
00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.960
the latter of which is not okay and i'm
not trying to say whether this should or

801
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.160
should not have been made because all
art has a place

802
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.800
there is a context for every piece of
earth that can add value to our world

803
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.720
both for enriching our culture conveying
a message about the world we live in

804
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.839
or even acting as a confrontation
between what we believe

805
00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:19.839
about our culture and what the reality
of that culture is

806
00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:22.880
killing stalking has a lot of
interesting nuanced

807
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.000
layered and poignant things to say that
make it

808
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.359
work as a horror story and stories like
it are actually often enjoyed by people

809
00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:34.960
who have suffered abuse
a way for them to see that they're not

810
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.200
alone in their trauma
survivors of abuse can often feel very

811
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.960
isolated so seeing someone
who has been hurt like them in fiction

812
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.720
can be very cathartic
but all of these things are being

813
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.000
overshadowed by how a fetishistically
appropriative audience

814
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.359
has turned it into a romance novel and
this is concerning to me

815
00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:59.119
not just about how these people read the
media they consume

816
00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:03.280
but also if they might think that this
type of relationship

817
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.960
is normal do they have the ability to
understand

818
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.599
when they are in an abusive relationship
are they going to do the right things

819
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:15.119
and confront their friends when they're
in an abusive relationship

820
00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:19.040
or are they going to push through and
encourage others to do so in the

821
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.559
hope that something beautiful will
blossom out of the trauma

822
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:27.440
or are they completely aware of what is
safe and acceptable

823
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:34.400
for them but their ideas are
different for queer people as we in real

824
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.559
life
progress more and more towards sexual

825
00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:40.319
tolerance and acceptance of safe sexual
practices in kink

826
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:45.040
s m and role play are we challenging
fiction to raise the bar

827
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.079
as we have fewer real-life applications
of forbidden

828
00:55:48.079 --> 00:55:52.720
love are we as a culture raised on
folklore about enduring abuse for

829
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.680
romance
increasing the amount of abuse that must

830
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.760
be sustained to achieve
true love we need to be more open to

831
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.119
discussing abuse
so listening to those who have been

832
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:07.280
abused so that they might feel
comfortable telling their stories

833
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.839
so that people can better judge what is
healthy and what is not

834
00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:17.599
what is safe and what is dangerous
we need to make it safe for the victims

835
00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:23.359
of abuse
to feel safe otherwise people and not

836
00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:26.960
just young people will continue to think
that the relationship between songwoo

837
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.880
and yoon bomb is true love
that enduring trauma is fine for the

838
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.559
right person that it's a necessary part
of falling in love

839
00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:38.799
abuse is never a necessary part of
falling in love

840
00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:42.240
and so in the description of this video
i've listed resources and links for

841
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.000
anyone who might feel that they've
become

842
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.119
trapped in an abusive relationship abuse
is not love

843
00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:56.880
trauma is not romance
please do not let they can change

844
00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.680
trap you in an unhealthy or dangerous
situation

845
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.880
get away while you can

846
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.000
because a happily ever after

847
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:27.839
should never involve pain

848
01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:06.160
you
