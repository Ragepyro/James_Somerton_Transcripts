00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920
tuesday but maybe wednesday's a better
day i don't know yeah

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.160
we we have spent the last three days
shooting shooting this is probably your

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.920
most intensive shoot that we've done
yeah it's like it's not the longest

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.519
video because that one is the camp video
yeah but that was just sitting in front

9
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.520
of us a backdrop that one was designed
to be two videos this one was designed

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.160
always from the beginning just to be one
yeah and this is long yeah um we have

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
[ __ ] to say
there's a lot to talk about um we talk

12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.559
about a lot in the upcoming video it was
supposed to just be a short video about

13
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.800
stranger things
and has turned into a very long

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.360
dissertation about nostalgia and media
and culture the dangers of nostalgia in

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.520
culture and why it's needed and how it
can be used against you and yeah all

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.359
sorts of stuff so that'll be out this
weekend so look forward to that um you

17
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.159
guys patreon friday for patrons right
hopefully hopefully yeah

18
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.400
i'm saying that without a finished vid
without a completely edited video so i'm

19
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.799
like hopefully you ended up pretty fast
though edit pretty fast though i do once

20
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.280
i actually get into the groove i've been
focused mostly on the effects so far

21
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.240
because it's a very it's a very effect
heavy video um

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.720
but the effects work look great so
um

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.960
so yeah if you guys follow me on
twitter twitter uh you would have seen

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.520
earlier this week late last week um
i put out a tweet which subsequently got

25
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.520
deleted
um saying that nick is moving away

26
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.040
um
nick is not moving away well nick

27
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.520
technically is we both are
um

28
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.680
we won't get into the details of the
whole discussion and everything um

29
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.240
but we're going to move to toronto
uh

30
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.640
at
in the near future yeah uh my current

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.400
aim is november
um but

32
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.360
if november doesn't work out it will be
the spring because we don't want to move

33
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.640
in the middle of winter uh we actually
moved to halifax in the middle of the

34
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.040
winter do you remember that beginning of
january it was like after new year like

35
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.040
just immediately after new year's yeah
it was within the first next few days

36
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400
after new year's but like we were
traveling new year's eve driving from

37
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.080
ontario to halifax yeah um and that was
not a good time

38
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.920
no no
that was that was a bad time

39
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
yeah
um so i don't want to i don't want to go

40
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.680
through that again
um

41
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.680
so we'll be sk if we don't move in
november we'll be moving in like april

42
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.200
yeah but um
absolutely we'll be moving to the

43
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
toronto area
um for multiple reasons you know just

44
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.280
we've been in halifax for a long time
and halifax isn't exactly giving us

45
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.519
anything i've talked before about how
halifax pride likes to pretend we

46
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.640
actively pretend we don't exist as per a
member of the halifax pride board making

47
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.360
and making media that well yeah yeah
like

48
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.319
and just what bothers me is that we i i
worked for this pride organization yeah

49
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.519
and they complain about not having very
much like

50
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.440
halifax local headlines yeah and they
complain about anytime they do have like

51
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.840
a local halifax artist they get crickets
yeah and it's like okay you have a

52
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.040
halifax-based nova scotia-born creator
making content that is internationally

53
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.400
renowned or known of like you are you oh
we're so fancy you have been cited in

54
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.159
papers before which honestly like if you
are cited as for like university papers

55
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.840
i'd like my name on that too but we have
been cited and you have been cited okay

56
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.720
good okay yeah um
it's only one or two university papers

57
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.280
we have an international following and
halifax pride doesn't really want to

58
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.439
tango with us yeah because we're not
nice to the banks

59
00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.040
we haven't even really said anything
nasty about the banks

60
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760
we talk about wait until we actually
make our pride videos we talk about

61
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.920
capitalism and corporations in general
but you know like you know corporations

62
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.840
love having the license of saying we're
one of the good ones yeah so you know

63
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.160
like td feel free and we're having for
i know there's quite a few patrons who

64
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.639
are also um supporters of telos uh we're
having a [ __ ] of a time getting actors

65
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.240
here yeah and
like i have the script for final girl

66
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.479
finished and there's like eight speaking
roles in the movie

67
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.240
and i'm like we're not gonna be able to
cast eight people yeah unless we go with

68
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.440
bond at the bottom of the barrel like
kind of get what we can get yeah just

69
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.560
friends of friends who have never acted
before and then it's like well what's

70
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.600
the point of making it it's like here's
quality queer content it sucks but it

71
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.800
exists it's like well that already
exists

72
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.240
well yeah like and that's the thing like
there's no reason in making that kind of

73
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.919
diy queer movie if that's what's being
done yeah and that's not what we

74
00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.960
promised you promised stuff that hasn't
been done before exactly we promised

75
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.600
quality
and so

76
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.639
we promised stuff that hasn't been done
before exactly we promised quality

77
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.720
well i mean
i've watched gay movies

78
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.320
gay tv is doing good but gay movies are
oh yeah yeah

79
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.360
um
but yeah so bro is coming out soon

80
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.320
what is excited for bros
i don't think i count that among when i

81
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.039
say gay movies i mean like
they're practically gay movies made by

82
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.919
asylum like they're
not they're not good

83
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.479
um
but yeah so we're gonna

84
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.800
make the move sooner rather than later
because we want to obviously keep our

85
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.080
promise to
everyone who signed up for the indiegogo

86
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.199
and just like on a psychological level
we need to change

87
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.800
yeah like we we need to change we've
both kind of worn out our appreciation

88
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.080
for halifax
my relations are drying up and like and

89
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.360
like
i love the apartment we're in but at the

90
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.720
same time
i will love living alone because that's

91
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.479
the plan yeah moving and we're not
moving into a new place we're not going

92
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.960
to be roommates we're going to have our
own places

93
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.720
we're going to i'm going to be getting a
two-bedroom so that we can have a

94
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.840
production facility
um

95
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.280
where we can also you know record the
podcast and we'll have the soundproofing

96
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.319
done and all of that stuff um yes i hope
that having that distance will improve

97
00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.479
our working relationship too so it's not
a matter of just um

98
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.240
you know kind of doing things any time
of day whatsoever barging into rooms and

99
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.160
being like hey do you want to do this
work thing now the minute you show up

100
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.880
late to the office the minute
no we can like make these appointments

101
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.520
you'll be the ones showing up while i'm
asleep

102
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.400
we can make these appointments um like
ahead of time and actually meet up um

103
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.120
like while the sun is still out
imagine

104
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.199
filming while the sun is still up is
gonna be interesting

105
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.440
probably not going to happen honestly
luckily most of like filming videos yeah

106
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.560
yeah probably like but that's what i
mean like that's a one once a month

107
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.039
thing like we get those we get we meet
up for that like it's a video process

108
00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.720
like it's yeah it's not and i said to
james like it's not that much different

109
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.120
than what we've already been doing it's
just that instead of living a few feet

110
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.000
from each other we'll be living like i
don't know a few miles or i'd walk away

111
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.680
from each other like i don't know yeah
um

112
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.919
because like i've been looking at the
prices and stuff and honestly

113
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.360
they're not that much more expensive
than we're paying now the apartments are

114
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.520
smaller
um

115
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.720
but they're not that much more expensive
than we're paying now and they're in a

116
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.599
city where
um

117
00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:52.879
actors exist yeah and yeah it's not
vancouver it does get cold

118
00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:58.560
but vancouver's way more expensive and i
would not i i don't want i yeah like

119
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.520
we've been kind of humming and hawing
about a lot about either toronto

120
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.440
vancouver or montreal
and montreal done [ __ ] the best we were

121
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.280
leaning heavily towards montreal to the
point of like yeah this could work until

122
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.080
we learned about recent laws that were
passed in montreal that will make it

123
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.280
impossible
uh for us to be there and for us

124
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.720
especially to make content there yeah um
and vancouver is too far

125
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.080
it's too expensive i wouldn't say look i
don't care how far it is like i would

126
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.680
just
you know

127
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.599
do a road trip get my car drive to
vancouver um

128
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.200
but it's the
expense

129
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.519
because
technically i could afford

130
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:41.440
an apartment in vancouver definitely not
a two-bedroom yeah technically i could

131
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.000
afford one
but then

132
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.760
there it where
there's nothing there's no money left

133
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.560
yeah and i think that that's a bad move
to do if we do that with the expectation

134
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.120
of growing the channel rather than
having already grown the channel to a

135
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.519
point where it's like sustainable yeah
because you guys are awesome um but

136
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.360
every month we do lose a significant
amount of patrons usually in the triple

137
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.880
digits
um most of them don't give me a reason

138
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.399
when they do give me a reason it's not
enough anime content

139
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.720
as i said on other podcasts but we've
got anime content coming attack on titan

140
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.480
is the next video
calm down well yeah it's the next public

141
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.839
video i think it's also just a lot of
like that's kind of passive for patreon

142
00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:26.399
people kind of support and unsupport as
needed i think so um i really think that

143
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.920
rolling out a lot of the new patreon
content we're planning to come out uh

144
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.800
going forward is going to help retain a
lot of people because we're actually

145
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.279
going to be living up to the promise of
like providing something for people

146
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.920
rather than just open a prayer and like
hey thanks for supporting us we're

147
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.920
keeping it we're just going to keep on
keeping on like yeah like with the the

148
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.000
the new stranger things nostalgia video
there's a big section

149
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.200
um
that is only for patrons yeah that only

150
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.440
patrons are gonna get and i wanna keep
doing the podcast uh we're going to keep

151
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.640
doing that uh
we're going to

152
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.480
record audio commentary for almost every
video that you have out

153
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.839
and gonna be releasing that procedurally
and we're just gonna work on uh whatever

154
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:07.360
other stuff that is listed there that is
escaping my memory right now

155
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.920
yeah
um

156
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.519
there's there's a lot there's a lot um

not going to edit it was it eisen

167
00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.680
deleted stuff the the bloopers that i'll
post on patreon it i had such a time

168
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.440
with some of the lines and stuff that
should not have been difficult to say

169
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:13.600
other things that were like very
intricate sentences i'm just like

170
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.079
oh my god yeah um
that is um president eisenhower we're

171
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:27.200
referencing yeah or eisenhower or
eisenhower as i was

172
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.560
that was back when republican presidents
actually give a [ __ ] about social causes

173
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.160
consistently going on
um

174
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.800
but yeah so that's kind of the
announcement that we're moving so

175
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.360
if we do move in no we're going what
we're the plan is is to get some movie

176
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.920
get some movies get some videos done so
that we never miss a month yeah even

177
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.680
though if we're moving in november we
won't have to like stop everything to

178
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.360
record a video we might not be able to
like yeah how long things will be packed

179
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.800
and moving
i know that my camera and computers will

180
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.720
be in my car with me start packing like
now because it takes us forever to pack

181
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.639
anyway so like maybe getting out if
we're moving in april yeah that's true

182
00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.639
let's
down first

183
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:14.639
um
but yeah so those are the those are the

184
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:19.279
plans
um for the upcoming

185
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:22.880
future of
the channel for telos

186
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.480
all that stuff um
i

187
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.560
think that will
being in toronto will severely

188
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.160
decrease the frustration i'm having in
finding actors because we're we're

189
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.639
finding more actors in new brunswick
i am getting so many actors applying

190
00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.320
and none of them are here
yeah none of them are local and i've

191
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.480
only posted on local job boards so i'm
like how are you finding these

192
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.160
like
one person from none of it applied and i

193
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.240
was like how did you find an actor job
in halifax living in none of it how did

194
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.440
that happen
um

195
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.600
but yeah um hopefully i'll be able to at
least get a short film done here yeah

196
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.680
so that you know it's not like ah yeah
you gave me money and now i swear i'm

197
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.160
holding on to it like i feel like
posting screen caps of it of my savings

198
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.200
account with all the
yeah indiegogo money to just be like

199
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.560
it's there
it's growing with 12

200
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.600
a month interest
um

201
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.959
so like
but like regardless like moving is

202
00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:31.279
stressful it's really really stressful i
hate moving i hate moving so much our

203
00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.680
plan is to basically get [ __ ] in boxes
and hire movers to bring it down to the

204
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.920
truck with us because
and then get it to ontario and then hire

205
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.519
movers to take it out of the truck
um

206
00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:47.440
the big thing is probably going to be
the lego

207
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.600
that's going to be required
the couch the desks

208
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.160
i mean in terms of just what's going to
be the most time-consuming because what

209
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.120
i want to do with the lego i want to
disassemble as much as possible have it

210
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.160
all in separate little baggies numbered
as per what the instruction booklets

211
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.910
would be so that way they're they're
easy to put back together

212
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.839
[Music]
that's a lot

213
00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:09.519
that is a lot but we have a lot of lego
and you hate putting them together when

214
00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:12.720
they're just piles of bricks

215
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.399
yeah yeah um
another thing that we'll have to figure

216
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:20.240
out and i don't want to like spend the
podcast being like oh we need to work on

217
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.000
this um i mean what did you want to
spend the podcast on well talking about

218
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.800
moving and stuff but
the process

219
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.639
like the shelves
you can't buy these anymore no you

220
00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:34.720
cannot so do we take these with us or do
we replace them later i think we take

221
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.480
these with us
because one of them one of us is going

222
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.199
to need well like you're probably going
to keep on keep the shelves because i

223
00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:45.199
think you bought most of it
you might have split one or two of them

224
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:51.040
but um some of them are just yours
the shelves the lego oh yeah yeah yeah

225
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.079
that's what i mean like i mean the
shelves themselves oh

226
00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:58.079
yeah i don't know i can't remember
so like you know we're gonna have to

227
00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:01.199
figure you're probably gonna have those
i'll probably have to buy my own for

228
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:08.560
lego setups for whatever i have
but uh yeah i hate moving i've i i move

229
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.800
i was lucky enough as a kid to not move
very much i used to think i moved a lot

230
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.120
until i became friends with people who
moved a lot how much is a lot in this

231
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.440
case
i

232
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.600
remember
living in four different houses that's

233
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.680
between being born and going to college
that's pretty light yeah um

234
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.759
i had a [ __ ]
uh my mom never lived in a place still

235
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:37.279
to this day has not lived in a place for
longer than five years

236
00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:40.240
um
so there were two places that we were in

237
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.160
for a significantly long period of time
and

238
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.120
we lived before i was seven or eight
before i was seven we lived

239
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.240
in like
four or five different places in uh

240
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.360
toronto i was born in toronto actually
and um

241
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.399
so i some of them i don't even remember
um and then when we got to

242
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:07.680
the small town of perth ontario
um we moved a bunch around there then we

243
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.440
found a permanent spot after that and
then we moved around a permanent i mean

244
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.759
like we lived there for five years then
we moved around a bunch and then we

245
00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:17.279
found another permanent spot and then i
went to university

246
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:23.440
so i have moved around quite a bit see
for me i know that we moved

247
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.079
several times when i was a baby like
before i was a year old yeah we lived in

248
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:31.680
like three or four different places
um

249
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.320
because
it was easy to do that because the

250
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.639
people my dad worked for like they had
furnished apartments and stuff furnished

251
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:43.279
houses so we just kind of bopped around
and then we found a house

252
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:46.000
that
was as far as my parents were concerned

253
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.519
they were actually rent to owning it so
every month they paid rent and it was

254
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.240
going toward a mortgage
um

255
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.120
but then my dad broke his neck in his
back

256
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.440
when a car fell on him he was a mechanic
uh a car fell on him

257
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.920
and he couldn't work anymore he was
fighting the government for compensation

258
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.720
benefits and everything and so we didn't
have the money to pay the rent so we had

259
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.799
to leave
um

260
00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:12.720
and then we moved into an apartment and
the thing i remember the about the

261
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.039
apartment it was a pretty sizable
apartment but because in this area where

262
00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:21.360
we lived apartment was like was this the
one that was insanely cold all the time

263
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.600
no
um

264
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.319
we were only in this apartment for two
or three years

265
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.240
um
[Music]

266
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.080
and
it was surprisingly large but the

267
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.760
mindset of the area was if you live in
an apartment you're poor it doesn't

268
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.360
matter how big or nice the apartment is
you're poor oh wow um and we were um and

269
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.440
that's why the apartment was affordable
but the thing i remember the bathroom

270
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.320
was about the size of my current bedroom
it was huge

271
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.679
for no reason
um that was very drafty bathroom

272
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.760
not that i remember
but um it was a basement apartment um

273
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.880
with the balcony um yeah it was like a
two foot it went two foot out and then

274
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.240
it was just surrounded by concrete for
about five feet up

275
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.720
um that's weird it was very weird that's
very weird and very creepy because

276
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.039
sometimes people would jump down there
and just look in the

277
00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:20.320
patio doors
very creepy

278
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.960
um and then we moved into another we
moved into a seniors duplex

279
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.679
um because that was the only affordable
place and then through the public

280
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:34.240
housing system
we got

281
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.400
assigned a house
that we actually lived in for 10 years

282
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.880
and i remodeled the basement of it like
i

283
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.400
we lived there from the time where i was
seven to seventeen

284
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.080
um
[Music]

285
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.480
or might have been eight to eighteen we
were there for ten years um

286
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.160
and
like again for my mom it was like this

287
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.200
is permanent house
um

288
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.320
but then she got injured on the job and
couldn't afford it my her and my dad had

289
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.400
split and so that's when we moved into
the house where the bottom floor was so

290
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.720
cold in the winter that if you made a
pot of boiling soup you had to run

291
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.000
upstairs or else the soup would be cold
before you got because they just didn't

292
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.720
put any insulation there was no
insulation in the bottom of the house

293
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.760
yeah the floor was ice
like just i can't imagine my mother put

294
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.960
the christmas tree upstairs
like that's in in the hallway between

295
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.919
the bedrooms wow

296
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.559
um we never
and then i moved away for um i i always

297
00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:40.880
my mom was single for most of my life
and when she had husbands they were kind

298
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.480
of deadbeats
um

299
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.679
i'm sorry about that impression i'm
sorry about one i'm not sorry about the

300
00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:50.400
other um

301
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.720
i really liked one of them but the other
one was a psychopath is a psychopath

302
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.640
unfortunately yeah um

303
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.559
so like we my mom was never really doing
great financially ever because when she

304
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:08.400
did get her college diploma then she had
her

305
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.039
uh student loans basically daunting her
constantly and my mom is also the kind

306
00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:17.440
of person who made a lot of decisions in
the name of love and not necessarily

307
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.240
decisions in the name of a bank account
and won't lie on her resume no

308
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.840
she won't everybody lies on the resume
she doesn't even try to make herself

309
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.960
look good on her resume i i got really
frustrated when i was trying to help her

310
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.440
with a resume and she told me what to do
for a resume like how you make a resume

311
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.159
and i was like you asked for my help i'm
like yes but you don't know how to do it

312
00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:40.000
i'm like mom i took a
i literally took a course about this

313
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.400
yeah like a university
level course about how to make a resume

314
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.600
like i early on i always lied on my
resumes because i was like i don't have

315
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.039
the experience i want to get these jobs
my mom struggled for money for a very

316
00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:54.640
long time and we lucked into some really
amazing places we had to endure some

317
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.400
really bad places
luckily mom kept us away from really

318
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.200
really bad places we never really had
bug infections we never really had um

319
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.520
like heating problems like we there was
there was enough

320
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.640
uh my mom
when it came to other bills that was

321
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.080
touch and go but when it came to you
know having a roof and having food that

322
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.919
was my mom's priority and she delivered
oh yeah like my parents it was always

323
00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:21.600
with bills other than rent it was okay
this month we're going to pay the power

324
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.200
bill next month we're going to pay cable
the month after that we're going to pay

325
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.840
the phone bill and then like repeat in
this three month

326
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.080
cycle my grandparents did have to sort
of pick up the slack uh sometimes when

327
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.799
things were specific especially kind of
lean yeah uh but after my mom started

328
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.919
working full-time as a student support
worker then things kind of became a

329
00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:44.480
little bit more stable like there were
times where she had to hold down three

330
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.360
jobs including a part-time job in her
career yeah um and since then the her

331
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.120
job has completely screwed her over
um and she doesn't really and she's

332
00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.000
enjoy she enjoyed a workplace injury
has

333
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.480
i don't want to talk about it uh but
yeah like things are rough for her right

334
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.840
now and i want to try and help her get
back on her feet properly but which is

335
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.720
why you want to move back to ontario
yeah which is another reason why i

336
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.240
didn't really want to go to vancouver
even though i do kind of have it in my

337
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.880
heart as like a long-term dream i need
to help my mom right now yeah um i'm

338
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.600
glad you're respecting that um whereas
vancouver for me was this that was the

339
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.880
temporary
california is the goal well yeah but

340
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.000
like
if vancouver was the temporary then what

341
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.919
everywhere is temporary
well no los angeles wouldn't be i know

342
00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:36.559
like if los angeles is the only person
in place then it doesn't really matter

343
00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:40.000
where else you land
as long as there is a through line to

344
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.760
hollywood which you know toronto and
montreal do have that

345
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.640
yeah um toronto in particular yeah um
because like canadians don't think

346
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.200
there's going to be a whole lot of
connection between hollywood montreal

347
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.200
now yeah canadian film industry was
mostly focused around vancouver that's

348
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.559
where all the canadian offices were and
we're all the canadians sort of because

349
00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:03.200
it was just north of california but they
were actually going to build a hollywood

350
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.600
north sign in vancouver to go up in the
mountains but then the federal laws and

351
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.360
turn they changed the tax breaks tax
breaks on a federal level which was

352
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.840
under conservatives
right um and the liberals have not fixed

353
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.760
it yeah and toronto
provinces have been fixing it themselves

354
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.799
the provinces have yeah ontario has a
huge tax break system for filming yeah

355
00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:29.600
and um toronto is kind of where like
there aren't the canadian film studios

356
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.080
are in toront are in vancouver but
hollywood film studios are in toronto

357
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.640
yeah because hollywood that's where
they're they're off because

358
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.760
every time you see a movie that takes
place in a metropolitan area like

359
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.440
chicago or new york through shooting and
trying you will see establishing shots

360
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.480
from toronto and new york like
helicopter shots and stuff but when it

361
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.039
comes to street level stuff that is
toronto yeah in fact um according to my

362
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:55.200
cousin who works for catering and for
the film industry in toronto the toronto

363
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.720
film industry outgrossed the british
columbia film industry by about 2

364
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.960
billion oh yeah the the vancouver film
industry has really taken a dive after

365
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.960
the loss of the tax breaks yeah um
whereas ontario just said well we can

366
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.279
afford to do our own tax breaks
and that's basically what they did and

367
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:15.200
because the studios already have offices
in toronto they're like okay well we'll

368
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.200
just rent studios british columbia also
has you know a lot of expenses not as

369
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.080
much no okay no
see like when it comes to british

370
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.520
columbia i would like to vacation there
like going forward uh maybe live there

371
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.039
one day because it is like one of my
favorite places on the planet but like

372
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:35.279
for now like
toronto is fine toronto will be toronto

373
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:39.919
will be good yeah not just fine
um i also want to write that book about

374
00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:45.360
the wherewithal right and that's the
right area too yeah is it yeah yeah like

375
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.320
i don't know where young street is
geographically in toronto when i lived

376
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.880
there i lived around the boroughs i
lived in scarborough for a lot of it

377
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.159
um
my cousin lived in brampton i don't

378
00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:01.440
think we ever lived in toronto proper
yeah uh but definitely we kind of lived

379
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.279
around the um the eastern edge of
toronto yeah

380
00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:08.799
but yeah so i hate moving um
[Laughter]

381
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.640
and because i didn't have to move
like

382
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.760
when i was a kid moving you hate moving
did you know

383
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.919
that moving
is the third most stressful event in

384
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:24.320
someone's life yeah can you guess what
the first two are i think it's the first

385
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.000
death and divorce
death and separation yeah yeah in that

386
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.440
order death separation and then moving
yeah

387
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.360
um and at both times we've moved
together have been terrible

388
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.520
like oh yeah yeah like especially the
first time like our tempers really

389
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.320
clashed
because we were doing it all ourselves

390
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.880
and the second time when we moved to
this location

391
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.960
uh we had movers we had movers but we
were losing our minds

392
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.080
so oh yeah because that we were we left
an apartment that was flooding was we

393
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.480
had we had been moved to a different
apartment

394
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.000
that didn't have a dishwasher it was
because the one we had been in was

395
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.279
flooded it had been infested with bed
bugs it had been infested with

396
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:06.240
cockroaches
which that's one of the reasons i'm

397
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.760
almost i am kind of worried about
leaving here because here there's no

398
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.600
problems
if we can find in the new place um

399
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.200
smaller apartment buildings in fact i
wouldn't even mind like renting out a

400
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.240
duplex for me like you know a small sort
of section of a larger house uh there's

401
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.840
a lot of those i'm not looking at them
because i need my own space i know yeah

402
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.000
but like no like non-interconnected like
separate oh no i know i know yeah yeah

403
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.200
yeah like a lot of people will do that
they'll turn like their basement into

404
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.880
like a fully i could do that myself that
would be okay yeah i i i yeah because

405
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.440
the thing about if you want less bugs in
your apartment building live in one with

406
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.720
less people especially less people per
square inch mm-hmm or per square foot

407
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.279
yeah um most of the apartment buildings
i've been looking at don't have a ton of

408
00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:00.000
units yeah um so because that way like
if one unit does have an infestation

409
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.039
some of them are brand new yeah if one
of them does have an infestation they

410
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:06.720
can lock it down quickly yeah and it
isn't that much of an expense to move

411
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.600
everyone out while fema getting the
entire thing yeah

412
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.960
um which is what our old department had
to do

413
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.799
yeah they had to move people
completely into different from units to

414
00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:20.399
unions from one building to another
building entirely oh i know they had to

415
00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:24.080
do that too i know some people who did
that oh my god instead of just kind of

416
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.159
saying all right everyone we're going to
put you all in a hotel for one night and

417
00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:32.320
bug bomb the place yeah like they could
have done that well with bed bugs it's a

418
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.320
two-week process it's so it's one
treatment and then you wait two weeks

419
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.960
and then you do the treatment together
it probably would have been cheaper to

420
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.880
still put people in a hotel for two
weeks probably then yes just because

421
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.640
they had to pay for the apartment
hiring the movers to get everyone

422
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.440
everywhere yeah to just move everyone
around like it's anyway uh i hate moving

423
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.880
it's what i'm trying
sorry because when i was a kid most of

424
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.919
the times we moved i didn't move
i went to school

425
00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:04.960
from house a and got picked up from
school and was taken to house b like the

426
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.799
move took place and i was
not a part of it the whole house would

427
00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:12.000
be in shambles but my room would be put
together

428
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.919
that like my that was my mother's focus
like make sure when he gets home the

429
00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:17.760
room is
perfect

430
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.520
uh so my toys would be there like
everything when it came to us moving

431
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.960
like it was an all hands on deck thing
sometimes it was like me myself and my

432
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.200
mom kind of packing for like two weeks
and then we that's how it was when we

433
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.679
moved into the place with no insulation
and that's why like my brain immediately

434
00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:38.559
goes to moving if you're moving you're
moving into a worse place oh no

435
00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:41.919
which luckily when we went from the last
place to this was the opposite and it

436
00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:44.640
was great because we had the money to
hire movers

437
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.360
and it was a very simple process
i like even though we were doing it

438
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.000
during covet it was still like
a super simple process

439
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.840
um
fingers crossed that they moved to the

440
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.080
other side of the country is also a
super simple process

441
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.120
i hope so i hope so um
the difficult thing in my head the

442
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.120
logistics is that we'll be moving to two
different apartments in one truck what

443
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.039
might happen is we can also look who's
going to drive the truck

444
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:17.760
because like i'll be driving my car so
you're going to drive the truck i can

445
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.039
drive the truck i can also like the
thing about i do have a family so bored

446
00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:25.120
i'm not going to i have family in
ontario so i can just fly them up here

447
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.640
to help
that's true yep um another thing with

448
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.240
logistics is like if you have a place
first and i don't have a place by the

449
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.559
time you're moving um i can just bum it
with my family and we can just drop my

450
00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:40.399
stuff off at my families and then i can
move to toronto

451
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:43.440
um when that's doable my grandparents
have a whole lot of space in their

452
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.640
basement like yeah hopefully i wouldn't
be there for more than like a week or

453
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.000
two and it's not like a dank basement
it's a like it's a it's half it's

454
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.840
happening half of it is finished the
other half is for

455
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.480
storage my grandparents basement oh you
haven't been on the unfinished part

456
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.880
because it literally is boxes and
shelves

457
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.559
[Music]
but yeah so

458
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:05.919
the move
i'm dreading

459
00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:09.440
being in toronto i'm not dreading
because

460
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.640
i i was in toronto for a bit like i
toured uh the toronto film school and

461
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.679
all that stuff
and i got to walk around the city for

462
00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:22.480
two days and just loved it toronto is a
very beautiful city like it has it's a

463
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.720
city it has like my entire life i've
wanted to live in a capital city city

464
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.760
yeah somewhere where when you look up
you can't

465
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.360
right away see the top of the building
yeah yeah and toronto toronto has that

466
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.399
very metropolitan feel um but at the
same time it it isn't the size of new

467
00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:43.919
york it's not the size of chicago or l.a
um but it's sister cities are new york

468
00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:50.000
tokyo london like uh because it is
whereas halifax's sister cities are

469
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.600
san francisco
no vancouver's sister city is san

470
00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:00.240
francisco um halifax's is like bangor
but yeah like toronto has a very

471
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.480
urbanized feel even though it isn't
nearly as big as the urbanized cities

472
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.799
that it is kind of compared against yeah
it is several million people

473
00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:13.279
um i actually was surprised to learn
that there are only like

474
00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:17.440
three or four
mega metropolises in america and the

475
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.120
rest are all actually smaller than
toronto like when you get into there's

476
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.320
new york chicago and la i think yeah
like when you get into uh new york

477
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.120
chicago la there might be one it might
be philadelphia i can't remember

478
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.039
it may actually be austin or houston
maybe but yeah like when you get into

479
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:37.279
like atlanta's and when you get into
sydney's uh not sydney's uh

480
00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:41.279
seattle's yeah um toronto is bigger than
those those places so it is it is

481
00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:46.320
sizably large yeah um so i'm interested
to see how you are going to adapt to

482
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.279
that and how i'm going to re-adapt to
that because i used to live like i said

483
00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:52.559
i used to live in scarborough yeah and
like i was there for a couple of days

484
00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:56.640
and absolutely
adored it and it wasn't even like i was

485
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.760
going out with friends and stuff because
i didn't know anybody yeah it was just

486
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.480
the atmosphere of this city i am so
excited to move i can't tell you i am so

487
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.200
lonely here in halifax there's nothing
against you it's like i i don't exist

488
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.559
everybody when you live with someone
they kind of don't though they're a

489
00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:16.159
fixture they're not they're not like
it's it's not like oh i get to get

490
00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:19.120
excited about socializing with this
person because this person is is

491
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.480
literally in the wall next to me
i think married couples would disagree

492
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.240
with you i think married couples are

493
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.519
psychotic i wouldn't say psychotic i'm
sure many of our patrons are married

494
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:35.600
but um
like even if your life choices confuse

495
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.519
me even if i was at the point of like
getting married to someone like sure

496
00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:43.840
let's do it because i like jewelry um

497
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:48.480
i was actually thinking about buying a
ring the other day just out of just like

498
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:55.200
i want a ring um if in case my future
husband or what's a non-binary spouse

499
00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.320
just suppose i don't know uh my future
person uh spouse just say special spokes

500
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.960
i guess uh my future person is listening
i love the idea of wooden engagement

501
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.480
rings wooden wedding bands
wedding bands playing with especially

502
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.440
encrusted with some kind of stone or
something i see you couldn't get them

503
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.320
wet
you can't if they're finished

504
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.799
oh yeah if there's a finish on them and
normally when people get their hands

505
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:21.600
what they take the rings off anyway
women yeah men never take their wedding

506
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.519
rings off unless they're going out for
so because i i was at a family reunion

507
00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:30.000
and then you see one online and you're
like one of my

508
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.600
grandmother's sister's husband had
former kids one of them was gay and they

509
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.399
and he was getting married to a guy and
his guy made him a handcrafted

510
00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:43.760
wooden ring that was like mahogany wood
with a

511
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.080
um band of crushed up turquoise that he
turned into a paste and kind of put in a

512
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.919
groove around the side of the edge of
the ring wow that's really cute really i

513
00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:55.519
i fell in love with the ring like i was
like wow that is good it's such a sweet

514
00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:59.519
thing for a poor person to do they're
not poor i know i'm just i think they

515
00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:03.519
are not poor
um which like handcrafted wedding rings

516
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:08.000
that sounds like a fantastic idea like i
if if my future

517
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.720
um british lawyer
husband is um out there

518
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.440
listening
maybe it's a barrister not the one with

519
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.399
wigs like corporate lawyer british
corporate lawyer um is out there i want

520
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:25.440
a ring made of obsidian
yeah i actually saw a scene that's

521
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.200
assuming that i'm the one being proposed
i saw a picture uh yeah i can't imagine

522
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.919
that happening um i saw a picture of i'm
way too impatient for that either we get

523
00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:39.520
married now or [ __ ] off a solid sapphire
ring with a single gold band on the

524
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.800
middle um it was a solid ring made of
solid sapphire and there's only one gold

525
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.679
band of the middle uh worn by emperor
nero

526
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:50.800
um so love the romans um
fashion

527
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.200
right
that hasn't really been attempted since

528
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.440
then like why not
because uh we've lost taste yeah i guess

529
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.599
whatever happened to good taste whatever
happened to good taste uh but yeah like

530
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:05.200
i i'm excited to move to a new city to
get involved with the community like i

531
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.520
want to like get around to like
meeting different groups of people going

532
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.920
to like different i i'm gonna get
involved with the magic of the gathering

533
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.160
group yeah i was gonna say like i'm
excited to get like into like friend

534
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.800
groups and stuff but not gay ones
like i'm i'm looking forward to meeting

535
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.880
more nerds because i don't want to be
friends with gays because all the gays

536
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.599
that i know
are

537
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:34.240
all the guys that i know in person are
[ __ ] and not [ __ ] and like oh you

538
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.000
[ __ ] like
get away from me honestly i think that

539
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.359
changes a little bit in larger cities
where there's more competition so like

540
00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:44.800
[ __ ] get humbled whereas like in
halifax

541
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.960
you know queen queen the queen bee of
the halifax gay scene like they go

542
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.480
unchallenged even though like they step
into step foot into a bigger city and

543
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.920
they're red for filth like you know
when there's a larger city there's a

544
00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.960
bigger a larger chance that people and i
mean toronto has a like

545
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.440
i don't want to say ghetto but a gay
ghetto

546
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.720
uh what queen street i think it is i
thought it was young street or is

547
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.760
youngster the gentrified young street's
the giant street that runs through the

548
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.079
whole city okay um but they have a gay
street church street church street

549
00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:17.680
that's it yeah they shocked where is
folk there um the whole thing or just

550
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.440
sections um
outdoor scenes i loved all of it it was

551
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.560
all shot in toronto
why don't have it take place in toronto

552
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.160
then because it was going to take place
in toronto but then showtime got on

553
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.040
board and so it became an american city
that was shot in canada and half

554
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.240
produced by canadians but i don't
understand this like why am i financed

555
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.000
by canadians don't understand that
canadian culture is very similar to

556
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.880
american culture and like just because
it's across the border doesn't mean it's

557
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.960
invalid i guess well it's because the
canadian government won't

558
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.160
i know i know but why can't an american
company being like i want to set this

559
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.960
thing in canada

560
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:55.280
yeah they set things in the uk all the
time

561
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.720
yeah like all the time i think i think
it's because they want to travel they

562
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.640
want to travel
and traveling to canada isn't fun well

563
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.320
yeah like i think it seems it's like
going next going next door like canada's

564
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.520
going next door like why go next door
when you can go to another city over

565
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.920
anyway i i i i can write a movie that
takes place in dubai and go on a fancy

566
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.560
plane and
um like sex in the city too um yeah only

567
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.079
movie that the only reason that movie
existed is so that michael patrick king

568
00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:26.800
could have a vacation in dubai
and sarah jessica parker

569
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.599
and they could make kim cattrall look
ridiculous did they make her look

570
00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:34.800
ridiculous oh my god she's like throwing
condoms at men in the middle east and

571
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.480
it's
that's why she didn't want to come back

572
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.400
yeah that's why she it's very justified
for her not wanting to come back for in

573
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.960
just like that
i thought i heard that she was or was

574
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.839
that a rumor
uh her character is going to be

575
00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:51.520
mentioned more
she's in the new queer as folk and her

576
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.880
character is great and i don't see her
going back to sex in the city yeah

577
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.079
especially because like apparently just
like that's a train wreck

578
00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:01.359
it gets
a redeemable train wreck like they could

579
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:04.560
put it back on the rails if they wanted
to but they they could put it back on

580
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.560
the rails without a whole lot of effort
if they managed to do it is the thing

581
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.000
like that but it takes a little effort
that's the thing

582
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.920
yeah like it's um
they need to try

583
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.480
they need to try
um

584
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.680
and why try when you can just reboot
that's a t-shirt

585
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.160
that is a t-shirt why try when you can
just reboot write it down want me to

586
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.160

um

588
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.240
but yeah so i i'm i'm horrified of

589
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.240
um
at the same time i'm excited to move to

590
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.400

because

591
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.359
this is the first time
ever

592
00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:54.480
where i can make a move

596
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.359

to make a video about culture and
nostalgia so

605
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.880
that's gonna be eighty percent of the
video we talk about we mentioned

606
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.680
stranger things a few times yeah it's
like i i ran i run it back to stranger

607
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.599
things in the end yeah kind of i mean
like the whole theme the video is shot

608
00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:58.400
to look like yeah and it's like that's
that's a lie we talk about for like half

609
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.440
of it yeah stranger things occupies half
of it and then we talk about you know

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.280
um
yeah

619
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.960
so for anyone listening
um

620
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.359
yeah it's gonna be a ride
oh right right i i meant to say like um

621
00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:53.520
i go to the upside down yeah yeah like
special effects it's neat

622
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.400
um a degree like i said i'm excited to
get out to socialize and join groups

623
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.800
because i haven't done that here and
it's like okay well nick why haven't you

624
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.400
like here i feel like i've burnt out
halifax like there's only so much in

625
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.520
halifax you can do especially like
because the

626
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.720
is so insulated yeah
the queer scene in general is so

627
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.000
insulated there is a horrible gay
grapevine here if like literally i am

628
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.680
okay so do you remember do you remember
i hadn't been on grindr for like two

629
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.079
years you go on grinder someone asks you
is your [ __ ] gay is your [ __ ]

630
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.880
roommate still around yeah yeah
and like that made me so uncomfortable

631
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.040
yeah um i've been informed that when i
wasn't on grindr that people have been

632
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.079
catfishing with my pictures
um i thought that's an ego boost i guess

633
00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:40.000
so it's still uncomfortable
you told me i think that someone was oh

634
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.960
yeah i was just i was making a noise
we're on microphone

635
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.480
um no i was letting you know that it was
huge told me that um

636
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.040
because like the thing about like if
someone is catfishing with your pictures

637
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.839
they can say things as you well yeah and
then people just assume it's you yeah

638
00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:58.560
and so like you meet them in person it's
like i remember you from grinders like i

639
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.240
i don't
yeah and then yeah like story time i

640
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.440
when i was in business school so this
was 2012.

641
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.400
i was
there was a

642
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.839
uh
uh crackdown in halifax

643
00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:19.839
of it was either ecstasy or mdma
and

644
00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:23.119
a bunch of dealers got busted by the
cops

645
00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:30.160
uh specifically in the gay scene well
yeah um at one point

646
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.119
which i think is mdma i think so
a party driver we are street wise i know

647
00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:42.000
drugs children fellow children
fellow homosexuals like um

648
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.520
but so there was a big bust all of these
dealers got busted

649
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.599
um
somehow i got blamed for it i don't go

650
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:54.240
to bars i don't do drugs
you were apparently the snitch yeah i

651
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.880
was apparently the one who snitched on
them to the cops which if you know me

652
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.560
you know i don't talk to cops if i don't
have to second of all

653
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.000
i don't go to bars i don't know who does
drugs i don't know where to buy drugs i

654
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.240
don't know who sell drugs if you don't
know what drugs are called well yeah

655
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.839
apparently
like i i wouldn't know

656
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:17.599
like weed's legal here now but like if
we wasn't legal i wouldn't know where to

657
00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:21.119
buy weed i still have to tell you what
everybody knows where i still have to

658
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:26.319
tell you what the difference is between
like uh thc and cbd i get it now thc

659
00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:30.000
gets you high cbd makes you also i think
there's an alarm going off in your phone

660
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.800
in your room oh
you can head you can head out i'll hold

661
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.119
the port oh no i just want to finish my
story

662
00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:37.359
um
so

663
00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:40.560
i eventually so
i was

664
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.960
used as the scapegoat
by maybe the person who actually did it

665
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.800
yeah um
because i was never around so nobody

666
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.599
could really you know confront me about
it except they did because grindr

667
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:59.760
existed and i had a lot of messages
messages for years i still get messages

668
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.319
i get messages to this day
from people saying i can't believe you

669
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:07.920
got my friend arrested and i'm like i
don't it's like the thanos meme i don't

670
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.280
even know who you are like

671
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.520
it's like
what did i do oh my god it's like i

672
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.800
stayed at home playing skyrim on my
computer and got blamed for a drug bust

673
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.839
like okay i'm gonna go get my alert yeah
like i'm nick down the fort so um

674
00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:29.680
like a big thing about me like i don't
have a whole lot of queer experiences

675
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.560
and so like because i got to halifax
here

676
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.079
um i wasn't in a good place and i didn't
really know how to get myself out into

677
00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.319
the community and i didn't really have a
whole lot of people and i didn't know

678
00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:41.680
anybody in the community and james
wasn't you know james had that going on

679
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.760
and james also kind of james matches
energy and when he's around an introvert

680
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.200
he becomes an introvert himself so you
have two introverted people who don't

681
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.240
know how to get out and do stuff and so
like i just kind of spent a very long

682
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.160
time like i become very outgoing when
robin's around yes yes absolutely like

683
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.920
you match energies
um whereas i need a lot of encouragement

684
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.200
to be extroverted and i do like being
extroverted when i'm encouraged

685
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.079
uh if i can convince robin to move back
to toronto um her husband's family is in

686
00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:13.200
ontario i know yeah
um robin is my friend who has been

687
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.800
working with me on movies for years and
years and she's technically

688
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.760
a permanent telos employee she hasn't
been paid yet because none of us are

689
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.319
being paid technically she can't get
paid also

690
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:27.599
yeah because of a non-competition yeah
thing

691
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:30.560
so
i just want to clarify that not because

692
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:35.359
i don't want to pay her i do her job
won't let me because she has a full-time

693
00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:39.280
job right now and they won't let me i
mean like if she stay if she spend if

694
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.800
she comes to a meeting and there just
happens to be some cash in her purse

695
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.079
when she heads home i mean like i mean
that's what i said but she's like really

696
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:49.680
like above board
but i figured out a way i was like well

697
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.680
i'll hire your husband and pay him and
then you take the money

698
00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:58.960
oh sorry you're drinking water
[Laughter]

699
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.960
so like i i've kind of been watching
life pass me by very quickly and

700
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.520
i get really jealous and resent sorry
i'm taking pills i get such an a

701
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.200
horrible debilitating envy complex when
it comes to

702
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:19.520
uh media uh that kind of depicts that
kind of gay lifestyle um like i i don't

703
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.319
want to try watching the new queer as
folk or even the old queer spoken until

704
00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:25.440
i've had
time to you know kind of i already did

705
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.640
the queer video you didn't need to watch
it i'm just saying like i would like to

706
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.560
i would like to be able to consume this
media yeah um

707
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.119
yeah heart stopper one is one that i
don't think i ever would have really

708
00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:40.400
particularly enjoyed but it's so cute i
would have liked to be able to watch it

709
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.000
for reference without feeling like i
wanted to throw up young royals young

710
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.079
royals yeah because young royals has a
lot more to say than just like oh the

711
00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:51.760
gays are kissing yeah like i would have
enjoyed young royals i don't think i

712
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.839
would have enjoyed heartstopper just
because that kind of well so cute you

713
00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:58.880
told me i wouldn't like they're not
piney they're just they're they're not

714
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.760
pine either you also told me i wouldn't
like it even if i could watch it

715
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.119
yeah because it's really cute and you
you don't enjoy cute i just get annoyed

716
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:11.520
by frivolous [ __ ] like that but yeah
it's kind of frivolous

717
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.160
it's kind of frivolous i'm not saying it
shouldn't exist or that you shouldn't

718
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.000
like it british tv show i was saying
with a i want to stop talking about it

719
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.800
um i i'm so important for britain right
now i i'm saying like i could have

720
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.240
watched it and i i just can't i have
such a negative visceral reaction to

721
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.240
this [ __ ] and i i think that when i
start actually getting my life together

722
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.920
and start socializing and building my
own gay legend

723
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.160
uh gay skinny legend um

724
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.440
it's water weight because you've been
stressed and you haven't been eating

725
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.559
properly
and since skinny legend i'm like

726
00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:53.200
traumatized
um and so like having the chance to kind

727
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.599
of build my own kind of gay life um and
kind of figure out that i don't need to

728
00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:01.119
live vicariously through these things
and feel like i missed something because

729
00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:04.400
i haven't lived my life that way and
that me this media isn't telling me how

730
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.720
to live my life but so
well if you went back and watched queer

731
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.599
as folk i don't know if i would
recommend living your life that way i

732
00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:15.920
just haven't i just have a very toxic
complex around this kind of stuff

733
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.040
yeah
and i remember years ago we did try to

734
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.680
watch the first episode of queer as folk
and i think you got about 30 seconds

735
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.119
past the opening credits yeah and you
were like i need to turn this off yeah

736
00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:32.079
because it was showing me a style of gay
life that i did not have access to that

737
00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:37.119
i don't know exists but it does um like
because you saw it was the same kind of

738
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:41.359
thing in in bros
oh yeah yeah that kind of sort of club

739
00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:44.319
atmosphere like how are you going to
manage watching that you said you want

740
00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:48.319
to watch that because it's about a
aged 30 year old who's never been in a

741
00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:51.760
relationship an aged queer who's never
been in a relationship and is kind of

742
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.319
dealing with that and maybe it'll make
me feel like [ __ ] but i think because

743
00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:57.599
it's an older queer i could identify
with a little bit easier maybe i should

744
00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:02.720
see it by myself first maybe um
marvel's kind of spoiled me for most

745
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.520
movies these days anyway so what do you
mean um i just don't give a [ __ ] about a

746
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.319
lot of stuff that doesn't have like a
look you know like everything everywhere

747
00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:16.000
the batman
yeah like unless it's offering something

748
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.800
new and like just very
stimulating i just like

749
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.079
yeah i get that actually because like
even like and that's the thing it needs

750
00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:29.280
to be stimulating like i will watch tv
like crazy

751
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.599
like stranger things for instance like i
will just binge stranger things like we

752
00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:37.119
rewatched it for this video and i
rewatched all of it

753
00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:39.680
happily
like barely even like looking at my

754
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.359
phone yeah i'm glad i liked it a lot
better than

755
00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:47.680
i was informed that i would like i was
kind of informed by a lot of media that

756
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.520
i it would be the thing that i hated but
it was fantastic yeah like i think a lot

757
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.160
of people kind of
we get into it in the videos i don't

758
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.720
want to get into it here but kind of
like

759
00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.400
that it's the netflix version of ready
player one yeah

760
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.960
um that there was just like in this we
used the term nostalgia bait yeah and it

761
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.200
i watched it and i i didn't i started
with season three then two then one then

762
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.800
two and then four yeah um and because
you said start with season three because

763
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.280
you said it was the most nostalgic and
you're absolutely right the only one

764
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.400
that kind of did i
think the only one that really did lean

765
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.240
on nostalgia at all and the rest was
just kind of like making an 80s period

766
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.920
drama with some product placement
because to pay for to pay the bills like

767
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.400
yeah
and so like i was i don't even count it

768
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.359
as product placement because i'm like
this takes place

769
00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:35.280
in a time i mean the eggos thing was
like it seemed very

770
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.359
eggos and coke see i would have been
taken out of it had she gotten like

771
00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:43.520
no-name waffles yeah and that's what we
talked about in the video also yeah uh

772
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.839
and so like that's what i mean like i
don't mind product placement in

773
00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:51.440
any kind of visual media because you got
to pay the bills somehow and if it's

774
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.440
making quality then go right ahead
but like what i was saying with with tv

775
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:01.119
like i will binge tv shows and re-watch
them and just like because it's all

776
00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:06.079
character and it's so rich in character
because you've got hours and hours and

777
00:51:06.079 --> 00:51:10.000
hours and hours to dive into these
characters with a movie you know you've

778
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.680
got
two to three hours to tell this story so

779
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.280
there's only so much you can do there's
only so much character you can develop

780
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:22.240
yeah and so
if a movie isn't

781
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.400
wowing me mm-hmm it's hard for me to get
invested because the camera

782
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.920
like um everything everywhere all at
once well because watching that even

783
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.280
though the majority of it just takes
place in an empty office building

784
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.040
i was wowed by it because because in my
brain i'm like i know how much money

785
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.480
this was made for and holy [ __ ]
um

786
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.640
the batman i have watched the behind the
scenes documentary of the batman almost

787
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.680
as many times as the behind the scenes
of lord of the rings at this point yeah

788
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.119
like
it's phenomenal yeah and i really hope

789
00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:54.240
that we're going to get the more of
these movies as counter programming to

790
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.480
what seems to be the spiraling out of
control marvel aesthetic i've said like

791
00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.480
thor's been out for a few days now and i
have no interest thank you i was so

792
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.119
afraid you were getting to resent me
because i don't have any interest to see

793
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:10.079
it either no like i'm like
like i just like i love taika waititi

794
00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:14.880
but i just have no interest in marvel
stuff anymore yeah i'm just i'm worn out

795
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.800
by the repetitive plot lines the stock
the characters are have been their

796
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.240
characters for so long they're basically
stock at this point like i really think

797
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.119
what marvel should have done after end
game was take two years off yeah did you

798
00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:31.359
did you hear that they um green led a
sequel to eternals

799
00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:34.480
did they yep
that's what i read anyway i don't know

800
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.440
if it's a rumor or not

801
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.440
that would
be kind of bonkers

802
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.319
um i mean it's a flex if he is
oh yeah absolutely i mean that means it

803
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:49.119
might come out in seven years with how
things are being scheduled with marvel

804
00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:52.960
right now but
um but yeah like so like moving i hope

805
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.880
is going to
really get moving give me the chance to

806
00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.880
sort of kick myself into gear and get a
social life and become like and get

807
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.240
involved in the community like i want to
be part of a community i want to be part

808
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.280
of something
um and i'm just i can't do that here

809
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.920
because like when it comes to halifax
it's too insular it's very insulated

810
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.280
everybody knows everybody
and there is a point where you just kind

811
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.760
of
there's nothing new to there's no one

812
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.800
new to know you meet this person who has
who's friends with these people and

813
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.160
who's friends with these people which i
think that's the gay community in

814
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.599
general and that's why i've said like
i'm really interested in finding nerdy

815
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:33.280
friends yeah gay communities are small
but in big cities they're bigger they're

816
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.640
bigger but they're still you know
everybody knows everybody or has heard

817
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.920
of everybody kind of thing where that's
why i'm like yeah i want gay friends but

818
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.720
i want nerd friends yeah who don't know
my gay friends and that way i don't have

819
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.559
to worry about my gay friends finding
out what i say around my friends

820
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:53.680
when it comes to halifax and sort of
public socializing there isn't very far

821
00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.559
you can get if you don't like live hubs
and live music which i can't do live

822
00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:03.119
music i'm sorry and like i'm not that
interested in bars i don't drink so like

823
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:08.160
going and drinking a diet pepsi and the
halifax halifax is a very small city and

824
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.040
it's boring to look at the streets are
kind of interchangeable there aren't

825
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.200
really any like landmarks there are some
interesting there's like three streets

826
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.040
in halifax and everything else is
interchangeable yeah and so it's just a

827
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.400
very
small city and i've been sick and sick

828
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.079
of it for a while and the idea of like
being able to finally move with like a

829
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:30.240
solid kind of
um not a solid plan but a solid

830
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.480
determination from you and an ability
the ability to do that because we have

831
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.200
the patreon that that's it's lifted me
up a lot yeah

832
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.160
and that's one of the reasons why we're
going to be putting out a lot more

833
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:48.079
patreon exclusive content um the
you guys finally won the owl house video

834
00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:50.640

837
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.240
video

838
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:04.559
i
i'm i i haven't decided if it's gonna be

839
00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:08.559
the 45 45-day exclusivity or just
exclusive yeah what do you guys think

840
00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:12.720
comment down below start a poll start a
poll yeah should it be purely exclusive

841
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.760
the owl house video just for patrons or
should it be 45 days later i'll put it

842
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.400
on because on one hand i really like the
idea of like giving you folks something

843
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.839
that you can really just have yeah
that's just for patreon that you can

844
00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:30.319
lord over all of the all of the plebians
um and get them the science

845
00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:34.960
but at the same time like i love that
this community really wants uh the

846
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.040
content that we produce to be seen by a
more a larger audience so like i'm of

847
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.520
two minds about this so so am i that's
why like i i want to hear from you guys

848
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.920
um
and then after that we're gonna do the

849
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.920
attack on titan video which is going to
be controversial not going to be until

850
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.559
september though right because we want
to get we want to have the next month

851
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:56.400
and a half to really work on
patreon stuff uh that's not going to be

852
00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.000
till september um but
um

853
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.559
like the l house video is going to come
before that

854
00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:05.839
um but that one is going to be
controversial

855
00:56:05.839 --> 00:56:11.119
because my opinions don't of attack on
titan don't line up with everyone

856
00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:14.799
nick hasn't watched it yet so
when it comes to this we don't need to

857
00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:18.160
make anything definitive we just need to
raise the questions

858
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.960
yeah that's kind of my approach to
writing these things is not to make any

859
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.319
definitive answers but just kind of go
over

860
00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:28.079
a bunch of evidence for or against yeah
um

861
00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:31.280
not even both sides in it but just kind
of allowing people to make oh god i am

862
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.160
both siding it let's let's teach both
and what the kids decide uh

863
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.680
i think i think
i don't know um

864
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.640
but yeah we're gonna do attack on titan
um

865
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.839
at some point in the fall we're also
going to do number six which i'm really

866
00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:50.559
excited for
um

867
00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:53.680
so we're
we actually are doing some more anime um

868
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.160
accidentally the attack on titan thing
is more i've become obsessed with it and

869
00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.160
so i want to make a video about it and
it plays into the rise of fascism

870
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:07.680
fascism is pretty hot right now so and
people's failed media literacy

871
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.319
yeah that's what the video is about
talking about people and

872
00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:14.880
media literacy because there's so we can
talk about things like cabaret

873
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.920
and fight club the boys the boys finally
talk about fight club yeah so there's

874
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.119
there's there's a lot going to be in
that video too uh just like this one

875
00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:28.559
where american history x2 edward norton
has a habit of this kind of stuff

876
00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:32.960
he likes complex characters that people
don't get yeah um because he's one of

877
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:36.799
them
um i mean he is kind of i have from her

878
00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:41.760
details about that man that he is just
the biggest [ __ ] he's like isn't he

879
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.000
like just a massive diva apparently
which i'm sad because i find him really

880
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.480
attractive

881
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:55.119
in like a weird way i have never found
him a particularly

882
00:57:55.119 --> 00:57:59.520
stunning actor to be honest not nearby
apparently like he gets all this credit

883
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.440
as being like you know next level like
character actor

884
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.240
and i just i watch his movies and i'm
just like yeah you're you're pulling

885
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.000
your weight you're like you're doing a
good job but you're acting against robin

886
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.440
williams or you're acting against brad
pitt or you're acting against robert

887
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.359
downey jr or you're acting against you
know picking up someone else and that's

888
00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:21.599
the thing is like he toes the line like
i guess to his credit he kind of molds

889
00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:26.480
into the role yeah but like
he doesn't seem to like

890
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.440
uh roles that kind of have a lot of
range

891
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.680
they're all they're all very different
he all has a very clear

892
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.960
sort of nuances in his acting but like
you don't

893
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.799
you don't see the acting yeah
so i mean like to his credit but at the

894
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:44.319
same time like you know i'm not
particularly drawn to him because he is

895
00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:48.880
such a he kind of just he's not like
kristen bale who has a chameleon just he

896
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:53.440
acts like you know like yeah um i'm kind
of referencing his role in the big short

897
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.640
where it's just like whoa that that is
also christian bale

898
00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:02.960
yeah and apparently like in thor he
disappears into gore the god butcher so

899
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.920
which is something that you personally
were worried about you were worried

900
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.799
about because i am a huge fan of that
storyline yeah the whole god bomb

901
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:15.200
storyline god butcher
well it goes from godbutcher to god bomb

902
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.760
um storyline in
thor which they didn't do god bomb which

903
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.359
in the movie which i'm
not super happy about because they

904
00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:26.240
didn't have time because they also
wanted to do the mighty thor

905
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.799
yeah the jane foss thor which i i think
they should have not done that as they

906
00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:35.680
should have teased her in this movie
but um

907
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.440
yeah so
super excited about moving super excited

908
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.760
for the stuff that's coming up um
by the end of the year we're also we're

909
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.559
going to have
i think a video of given out

910
00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:54.799
two i think
i think uh did you want to do given

911
00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:57.839
given was rough for me like that was
also kind of like on the triggering

912
00:59:57.839 --> 01:00:01.119
media thing not even for the gay stuff
but for the um the mental health stuff

913
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:04.880
um
um we can talk about it like we still

914
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.760
have to do meetings and stuff like
yeah

915
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.960
um
but yeah we've got so much stuff in the

916
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.119
works and we've decided to
we've got videos and movies and we

917
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:19.359
decided to throw a move in the middle of
it all yeah um i mean like the move was

918
01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:25.680
kind of inspired by a lot of things just
not jiving one of it being the movies

919
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.359
yeah like i really do want to get a
short film done in the meantime

920
01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:33.359
especially something we can get off we
can do stylized we can do it quick and

921
01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:37.760
we can do something interesting very few
people to show everyone who donated to

922
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.440
the indiegogo and who don't who has
donated to telos directly through the

923
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.839
telos website um that
you know we're not taking the money and

924
01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:49.040
running we are doing stuff
we're just

925
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.200
literally in a place where we can't yeah
and so we have to reload okay and i

926
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.119
trust robin from what i've seen to hold
the one one-woman show like if this is

927
01:00:57.119 --> 01:01:00.079
going to be a short film around her like
i trust her for that

928
01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:04.000
um yeah and really for like the short
film i don't really want to focus and

929
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.640
this is kind of meeting stuff i wouldn't
really want to focus that much on plot

930
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.520
or specific like script but rather just
making a visual something visually

931
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.520
different more conceptual yeah yeah uh
well yeah that's meeting stuff we can

932
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.040
talk about that um not on the podcast
because we don't want to bore people

933
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.280
with business talk
um like we do on the

934
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.559
streams all the time hey the last stream
was the sex ed street it was

935
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:33.359
it did turn into a sex ed stream somehow
well we didn't have really a topic but

936
01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:37.200
that could that that kind of fit the
the the sex topic we've been wanting to

937
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.079
do on the podcast for a while yeah
um

938
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.559
so yeah lots of stuff going on this is
another like kind of a topic more of a

939
01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:51.040

940
