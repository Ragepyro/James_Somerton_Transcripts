1
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.040
Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.270
One of the first questions we’re asked when
we come out is “How did you know you were

3
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.270
gay?”

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.510
I… don’t know what most people are expecting
when they ask this.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.630
Do they expect some thrilling love story with
a sudden shock of discovery — a meeting

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.509
of pure affection and yearning, seeing beyond
the cultural conditioning of courtship rituals.

7
00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.830
Love, in spite of social standards.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.050
Or are they fishing for an answer that has
something to do with how you got a raging

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.330
stiffy at summer camp whenever a certain camp
counselor came around?

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.469
Either way, it’s an obscenely personal question,
and in the latter sense, a little inappropriate

11
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.670
for water cooler smalltalk.

12
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.129
Yet, in most cases, people who ask this question
seem a little… disappointed in the inevitable

13
00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.129
answer?

14
00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
You know, given that most of the time the
question is asked, the answer will be: “well

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.620
I always knew.”

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220
Some of us… don’t even put a whole lot
of thought to it.

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.820
We literally do just know.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.590
Like for me, I had a crush on Billy the blue
power ranger when I was 4 and that was that.

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.820
For others, it can take a little bit more…
self-deduction.

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.930
We see ourselves as being a little bit different
than the rest of our friends and certainly

21
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.000
different than how we are told we should be
in media.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080
Picture books, television, movies — stories
in general.

23
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.400
What we are told to feel about girls — is
how we feel about boys.

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.770
The nervousness, the confused obsessions,
the… little butterflies in your yummy.

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.720
And of course, naturally, the inverse for
lesbians.

26
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.500
And of course, the chaotic bisexual profile,
where you feel that way about boys and girls.

27
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.450
And, of course, all the ways in which this
identity growth applies to trans and gender-nonconformiming

28
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.450
children.

29
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.510
Between just knowing or piecing together our
identity from hundreds of small, fragmented,

30
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.930
otherwise unremarkable shreds of evidence
— we figure it out.

31
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.670
Sometimes, with no clear, discernable moment
of grand realization.

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.850
We wake up and say: “oh crap I’ve been
like this all along and I will be like this

33
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.850
all along.”

34
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.490
How much emotional turmoil this causes depends
on how homophobic your parents and community

35
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.490
are.

36
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.000
Sometimes you come out into a gentle place,
other times not.

37
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.530
Mainstream culture has weird conceptions about
how children ‘become’ gay.

38
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.519
The general thought processes is that someone
does not know or cannot know that they’re

39
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.040
gay before they’re sexually active enough
to develop a conscious preference.

40
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.659
The question: “how do you know that you’re
gay?” — or variants of said question — betrays

41
00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.849
a thought process that indicates that gay
is an exception to the rule.

42
00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.909
That there is a human being who is normal,
and that ‘gay’ or ‘trans’ or whatever

43
00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.900
else — is added later to this human being.

44
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790
A veneer, a tattoo — something that is added
to the self and thus, not a fundamental part

45
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.870
of the self.

46
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.870
So….

47
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.969
Because gay is an ‘additive’ component
of the self — these people think — there

48
00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.560
must be a singular moment when you become
gay.

49
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.469
The reality is that attraction to women is
just as remarkable as being attracted to men.

50
00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.719
In an objective sense.

51
00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.439
In fact, given that aromatic and asexual people
do exist — we should consider it remarkable

52
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.249
that we’re attracted to anyone at all.

53
00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:17.180
So why is it such a fuss when it comes to
letting children know that GAY exists?

54
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.799
We expose young people to straightness all
the time.

55
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.329
Straight Public displays of affection are
without taboo.

56
00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.709
The news loves depicting happy marriages.

57
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.640
Picture books are riddled with affectionate
moms and dads.

58
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.090
Young people heterosexually kiss all the time
in cartoons.

59
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.299
The objective of like…

60
00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.249
80% of YA novels is built around some pre-teen
straight romance.

61
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.389
Hell, As soon as a male and female toddler
meet the first words out of SOMEONEs mouth

62
00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.700
is “aww they make such a cute couple.”

63
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.569
So it’s not like kid friendly romance isn’t
available to young people.

64
00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.340
But why is it such an ordeal the second it’s
about two boys or two girls?

65
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.140
The answer is, somehow, that we musn’t expose
children to sexuality.

66
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
Okay.

67
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.090
Well how is two boys holding hands any more
inherently sexual than a boy and a girl holding

68
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.090
hands?

69
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.480
Bear in mind the Beatles owe their skyrocket
to fame thanks to their song: “I want to

70
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480
hold your hand.”

71
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.230
But at the time, this was essentially a scandal.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.930
“My daughter?

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.930
Holding hands?

74
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.930
Out of wedlock?”

75
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.070
Rock music before this was about how pretty
your girl was.

76
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.540
Touching and kissing was considered to be
absolutely unsuitable for even teenagers.

77
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.760
Elvis was so racy because he made songs about
dancing with girls.

78
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.600
His gyrating pelvis had women fainting.

79
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.750
Imagine if they went to a BTS concert.

80
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.501
So in modern times, over half a century after
the neo-puratin revival of the 1950s, why

81
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:42.510
is gay hand holding sexual — but straight
hand holding is not?

82
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.300
Even among people who are pro-gay in their
rhetoric, there seems to be a line drawn when

83
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.430
it comes to all-audiences media that depicts
any kind of gay representation.

84
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.950
Ah yes.

85
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.220
Back to Disney.

86
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.500
Look, I’m sorry.

87
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.310
But if you’re gonna go out of your way to
develop a monopoly that’s a cross between

88
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.970
an amoeba absorbing foreign bacteria and a
black hole where IPs can never escape — you’re

89
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.960
going to be the only place fingers get pointed.

90
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.500
In the past, studios and networks escaped
criticism about lack of representation because

91
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.040
there were a lot of them.

92
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.260
So anger about lack of representation was
not directed at a single corporation, but

93
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.480
a cultural trend about the business of show.

94
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.870
Nowadays, since Disney’s been mustering
its empire for the better part of the last

95
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.200
30 years, there’s so little competition
that peoples’ ire about representation is

96
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.580
laser-focused on specific executives in the
company.

97
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.580
Due to the size of the company and the command
over as many intellectual properties as it

98
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.860
has, people look to Disney in a unique way.

99
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.050
There is, yes, technically Illumination, Dreamworks,
and Laika who make animated films directed

100
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.090
at children.

101
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.710
Disney has the additional element of longevity.

102
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.610
A Disney movie is likely something that will
carry over for generations — something that

103
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.860
will not only be kept in a library of DVDs,
but something from which we can expect sequels,

104
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.330
spin-offs, theme park attractions, and endless
merchandise.

105
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.870
A Disney movie will stay around, and offer
continued returns in a way the Sing franchise,

106
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.860
for instance, is not expected to do.

107
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.370
And that’s due to the fact that when we
look at a Disney movie, we compare it to every

108
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.810
other Disney movie.

109
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.090
Whereas we gauge a Shrek movie based on other
elements within the Shrek franchise, and not

110
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.780
necessarily against Shark Tale.

111
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.050
A single Disney movie will speak not only
to this current day audience, but future audiences.

112
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.620
A movie that comes out in 1980 will not be
just a movie in 1980 because it will likely

113
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.400
be re-watched for years to come.

114
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.660
And even a Disney movie that is not successful
upon release gets a legacy because it becomes

115
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.950
a part of the Disney oeuvre.

116
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.440
Available for kids and adults to watch on
home video and Disney plus forever.

117
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.000
So while there is additional security that
a given Disney movie will have a consistent

118
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.021
presence in the Disney Family, securing otherwise
under performing films a cult fandom, there

119
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:08.060
is the additional pressure that it must fit
into the Disney family.

120
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.490
Suffice… this has created a bit of a problem
for the House that Walt built.

121
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.450
Disney, on one hand, owes its success to its
brand.

122
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.860
That’s the reason it became evergreen enough
to just drop $4,000,000,000 on Star Wars on

123
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.860
a whim.

124
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.860
Disney didn’t need Star Wars.

125
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.320
It was doing just fine.

126
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.680
Disney’s brand was built up on the original
values projected by Walt himself.

127
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.120
Family-friendly, accessible to children, innovative
animation, unabrasive, and timeless.

128
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.170
Even if Walt himself didn’t have all of
these qualities.

129
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.170
So.

130
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.850
On one hand, Disney corporate isn’t stupid.

131
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.320
They know that there are many gay and even
trans-friendly families.

132
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.590
By the principal of permitting children to
see themselves in these films, and knowing

133
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.210
that gay children and parents exist, there
is an obligation to depict that.

134
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.210
However.

135
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.730
Disney movies kind of need to be the film
equivalent of easy listening radio.

136
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.860
They don’t really want to rock the boat
— the long-term success of the company,

137
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.660
and being able to weather hardship is owed
to possessing a library of material that is

138
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.070
mostly inoffensive.

139
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.000
As time has gone on, certain once-accepted
tropes in storytelling have become problematic.

140
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.420
But for the most part, Disney’s creative
mandate was to remove as much provocative

141
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.190
thought from a story as possible to allow
the emotional simplicity to be very accessible

142
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.150
to audiences of all ages.

143
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.620
And this is where the problem is developing.

144
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.460
We’ve always expected media to reflect the
social values we hold.

145
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.459
It’s why early Disney was so white, so waify,
so straight, and had an obsession with depicting

146
00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:35.510
monogamous love at first sight.

147
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.269
And why older single women were so scary.

148
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:43.880
But the (majority) social climate of today
leans towards social justice.

149
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.199
Voices for the under-represented, healthy
depictions of romance as opposed to idealized

150
00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:53.769
ones, freedom of identity, and — most importantly
— fighting for these values in spite of

151
00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.350
resistance from established restrictions.

152
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.870
Rock the boat if one has to.

153
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.870
So.

154
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.269
Disney neither wants to make media that requires
much thought, nor do they want to ruffle anyone’s

155
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:05.540
feathers over a movie.

156
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:11.069
But they also want to make media that is as
reflective of all audiences as possible, which

157
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:16.579
demands going out on a limb and depicting
people over whom some of their audience will

158
00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.329
have their feathers ruffled.

159
00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:21.819
Doing one but not the other will violate the
tenants that have allowed Disney to become

160
00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:23.519
as successful as it has.

161
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.740
The easy solution would be to bite the bullet,
do your market research, and make a calculated

162
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.190
gamble at catering to the demonstrably larger
audience.

163
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:36.029
Captain Marvel did not suffer a box office
setback due to the picketing and protesting

164
00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:40.111
about Brie Larson’s outspoken attitude about
representation or the fact that this was a

165
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.130
strong female character in general.

166
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.260
And neither did The Force Awakens suffer a
box office backlash from the people protesting

167
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.790
an apparent black protagonist.

168
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.810
(Which was absolutely a JJ Abrams red herring
and Boyega deserves better.)

169
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:59.140
So I think it’s safe to say that erring
on the side of increasing visible, meaningful

170
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:07.439
representation would not generate a significant
setback.

171
00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:15.900
But, when it comes to the LGBTs, Instead,
Disney has been… trying to play the field.

172
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.589
With little snibbits of queer representation
here and there, but with the plausible deniability

173
00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:24.370
to insist that they haven’t actually put
gays in their movies.

174
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.339
But at the same time, not saying that they’re
not putting gays in their movies.

175
00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:33.040
So it goes, that people who follow movie media
news are a little bit more socially-minded

176
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.990
then the average Joanne and Cletus.

177
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.420
So Disney promotes a film with their first
gay character, knowing that it will only be

178
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.790
picked up by mostly very online audiences.

179
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.939
And then upon release, there’s so little
gay there that parent groups won’t boycot

180
00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:51.000
it because they don’t notice it.

181
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.470
And it was cute, at first.

182
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.680
The gays were patient.

183
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.040
We know what Disney is.

184
00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.020
And we know the kind of people who oppose
us, and we know that they scream family values

185
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.629
at the slightest inkling of gay hand-holding.

186
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:07.490
But I think we assumed that Disney would,
at some point, stop dipping their toes in

187
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.089
and dive head first when they realized how
warm the water was.

188
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:16.629
Especially after realizing how much money
we gays spend on Disney branded everything.

189
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:21.430
Disney’s consistent reluctance to butt heads
with the shrinking numbers and waning power

190
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:29.410
of Gay-Avoidant Parent Groups has led to a
culmination of very… ungraceful stabs at

191
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.079
projecting queer messaging.

192
00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:32.870
The defence now, apparently?

193
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:38.920
Kids can’t be gay.

194
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.510
We just went through a lot of media analysis
of Disney movies so we don’t have to do

195
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.510
that here.

196
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.120
Link in the description if you missed it.

197
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.529
But I am absolutely sick of the straights
telling me that Disney’s not going to have

198
00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:57.649
out-and-proud queer characters in their movies
because their movies are ‘for kids.’

199
00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:02.559
I’d like to know what about being gay makes
us unsuitable for children.

200
00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:08.180
To all the allies who rush to disney’s defence,
they really ought to know this is the exact

201
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:14.249
same argument that was used when gays weren’t
allowed to adopt or even raise their own children

202
00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:15.579
for the longest time.

203
00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:17.600
Why we weren't allowed to be teachers.

204
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.149
What about my lifestyle is so different from
a straight one?

205
00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:24.399
Really?

206
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:29.329
Why are you so afraid of having your little
brats exposed to two kissing cartoon ladies?

207
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:34.350
Are we still in the era of being worried that
seeing gay media is gonna turn your kids gay?

208
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.970
I do want to point out, in lieu of the prior
video about Disney’s ongoing vendetta against

209
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.790
gay characters, that they are perfectly comfortable
depicting queer stories.

210
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.649
As long as they don’t have queer characters.

211
00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:46.850
Queer stories around alienation,

212
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.870
isolation,

213
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.060
societal prejudice,

214
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.680
and walking into a small town and having to
ask yourself if you’re going to die there.

215
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.600
And it’s not like we want to swarm children’s
media.

216
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.620
Even in 2021, straight people do exist these
days.

217
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.620
For now.

218
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.860
But the difficulty becomes how Luca is essentially
the perfect gay youth love story.

219
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.269
Yet any instance of it being intentionally
mentioned is omitted from the final edit.

220
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:15.939
We’re on screen in all but name and identity,
and though some may argue that should be enough

221
00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:19.079
— that really is the most important step.

222
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:25.339
And yes, there is a… clump of gay people
— usually gay men of a certain age — who

223
00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:30.480
are gonna hold out and insist that it’s
never going to count as properly gay until

224
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.180
there’s sex on screen.

225
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.399
Dicks in butts.

226
00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:36.480
We really don’t need that toxicity in our
lives.

227
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.899
And they're too busy going on gay party boats
to watch movies anyway.

228
00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:43.069
Most of us though aren’t asking for that.

229
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:45.220
We’re not asking for a lot, actually.

230
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.220
I dunno.

231
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.569
Holding hands?

232
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:48.569
Specifically romantic language?

233
00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:50.910
Maybe a tiny little peck on the cheek?

234
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.910
Something like that?

235
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.779
Nothing more than what you’d get in a straight
cartoon?

236
00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:59.079
For these reasons, I have a hard time wrapping
my head around the idea that GAY content is

237
00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:02.139
inherently unsuitable for kids.

238
00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:06.749
If being gay wasn’t suitable for children,
then these obviously queer expiriences and

239
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:11.130
obviously queer characters would be rejected
by purity groups everywhere.

240
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.649
However, they are not.

241
00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:17.559
And they instantly find themselves among the
library of Disney classics.

242
00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:22.429
So if we are accepted in everything but name,
why is just outing these characters that’s

243
00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:23.429
the hard part?

244
00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:28.759
It’s hard to figure out what Disney executives
intentions are because… they're rich white

245
00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:32.589
Hollywood liberals who, on one hand, love
gay money.

246
00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:36.620
They want the gays to show up at Disneyland
and buy their overpriced water, and rainbow

247
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.620
mouse ears.

248
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.439
They love gay cruises and make a heap of money
off that.

249
00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:45.939
They recognize that gays will never have accidental
babies, and both surrogacy and adoption requires

250
00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:47.800
a stable, high income.

251
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.569
So… when gays do have families, they are
families with a lot of expendable income.

252
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:55.079
Which is the marketeer’s wet dream.

253
00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:56.420
The Merchandise sells itself.

254
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:05.939
But, on the other hand, Disney is terrified
of what has consistently proven to be a small

255
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:08.410
audience of family traditionalists and homophobes.

256
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:15.009
I… have a hard time blaming the corporate
body that is Disney.

257
00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:19.329
The company has survived a number of very
long periods of near-destitution.

258
00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:23.290
We look at Disney as an Empire now, but between
Walt’s death and the renaissance of the

259
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.730
late 80’s and early 90’s, everyone looked
at the company as a belly-up library of once-great

260
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.850
innovations.

261
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.019
Corporations in creative industries that have
survived financial crashes are ones which

262
00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:36.430
honour the value of the stuff that made them
popular in the first place.

263
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.149
Take Nintendo, for instance, which is so allergic
to adjusting its own brand and image that

264
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:47.679
it took years for them to move Pokemon to
consoles, in spite of high consumer demand.

265
00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:51.929
Steps to adjust existing IPs are extremely
incremental, because they understand what

266
00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:57.019
makes these video games sell well, and a complete
upset of format is a huge risk — a greater

267
00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:00.040
risk than a film studio takes on a single
movie.

268
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.480
Video game studios are not as robust, and
cannot absorb a flop as easily as Hollywood

269
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480
can.

270
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480
Not as good with the accounting.

271
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.720
Nintendo has also been burned bad over instances
where they have… let other creators mess

272
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.069
around with their IPs.

273
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:21.889
I don’t know that one is kind of iconic.

274
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:26.019
Regardless of Nintendo’s totalitarian approach
to streaming and fan art, the company sees

275
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:30.639
it’s financial security in the future based
around the ability to maintain the core components

276
00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.130
of their IPs.

277
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.679
Disney functions in the same way.

278
00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:39.239
However, unlike Nintendo making the 68th Mario
game, Disney can’t just tack on sequels

279
00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:40.239
ad infinitum.

280
00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:41.239
They tried that.

281
00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:42.239
It didn’t go great.

282
00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:45.929
Every Disney movie, in this respect, needs
to somehow be a spiritual successor to the

283
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:48.420
prior library of great Disney movies.

284
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.709
Every new Disney Movie needs to both aesthetically
and thematically be able to ‘fit in’ with

285
00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:54.920
prior entires.

286
00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.100
This is clear in marketing, as the Princesses
don’t need to be completely redesigned whenever

287
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.529
they make a Princess and the Frog, Tangled,
and Frozen.

288
00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:06.600
At other times, this makes its way into their
own content.

289
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.180
Which is good for creating consistently entertaining
movies.

290
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:15.579
—but it does mean that the archaic values
of Snow White by mandate must exist in modern

291
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.089
films in some way.

292
00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:22.500
Which means that films are still constructed
in ways that are bound by Hayes Code values.

293
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.130
Principal among them is that Gays are not
suitable for audiences.

294
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.580
And while it is not necessarily the corporate
body of Disney that is to blame for the lack

295
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:37.350
of representation, the responsibility is on
the shoulders of a handful of executives who

296
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.279
could have had the guts to stand up and fight
against the existing governing principles

297
00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:42.279
of the company.

298
00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:46.529
Whether they are personally adverse to homosexuality,
or whether they want to run a tight ship,

299
00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:54.120
the real problem that I see with lack of Disney-versity
is the audience.

300
00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:02.850
Yes, I know that queer folks, and many of
our allies, have been clambering for representation,

301
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.980
but even with our staunchest of allies, we
make up far from the majority of movie-goers.

302
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.490
And while many Disney fans are likely supportive
of Queer rights, there are many who rush to

303
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.370
offer Disney the usual defence.

304
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.769
“The fish-boys can’t be gay.

305
00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:17.720
This is a movie for children.”

306
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.789
“Maybe if they were a few years older.

307
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:21.120
Maybe 16.

308
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.140
Then they could be gay.”

309
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.010
“Why does everything have to be about making
things gay?

310
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.950
Can’t you just let kids be kids?”

311
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:34.640
At this point, Disney doesn’t even need
to defend its own lack of diversity because

312
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.210
they have an audience making arguments that
Disney itself could not officially make without

313
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.700
getting ripped apart by GLADD and the HRC.

314
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.860
A lot of these people are likely very much
of the right mind about gay rights, gay families,

315
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860
gay acceptance.

316
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.799
However, while they may also watch The Trixie
and Katya on YouTube, they hold the belief

317
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:58.850
that there is a time and a place for gay stuff,
and Disney is just not the right place.

318
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:03.559
I would ask why, exactly, Luca the fishboy
is too ‘young’ to be gay?

319
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.539
I knew I was gay when I was 10!

320
00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:10.390
This is no doubt due to the conflation between
same-gender attraction and sex itself.

321
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.150
Which, you wouldn’t know this from looking
at the way our culture has this discussion,

322
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.900
but they are absolutely not the same thing.

323
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.679
As a gay child, I didn’t want to suddenly
put on a full face of makeup and vogue my

324
00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.320
way into a bathhouse.

325
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.690
Believe it or not, but psychological development
among gay people happens at the same rate

326
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.799
as straight people.

327
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:31.830
We want to start having sex roughly at the
same time that straight people do.

328
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.910
It’s just that given that there are still
elements of taboo around gayness, we also

329
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.279
reject the taboo stigma of virginity.

330
00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:42.549
So we’re more likely to start going at it
when our straight peers still want to keep

331
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:44.520
their legs closed for Jesus.

332
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.120
And given that sex attraction is the socially-defining
element of homosexuality, this is when the

333
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.610
straight hegemony SEES us growing out of being
otherwise perfectly normal boys and girls.

334
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.820
And this is also roughly the age when our
little brains begin to deconstruct the concept

335
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.370
of gender roles, so also the age when we begin
to question our gender.

336
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.559
Recently, I read a study that tracked a number
of trans people and their parents.

337
00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:12.139
The question asked to both parents and the
children was ‘before coming out, how long

338
00:20:12.139 --> 00:20:14.929
did you notice gender-nonconforming traits?’

339
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:19.360
Parents of children answered that they saw
absolutely no indication that their child

340
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.190
was trans before they came out.

341
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.580
Whereas the trans people themselves said that
they had known about their gender identity

342
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.220
for years, or their entire life.

343
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.120
The observation here is that regardless of
how we are perceived to be, we have always

344
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120
been here.

345
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.980
Just because so much of this process is internal,
does not mean it’s not happening.

346
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.389
In the same way, we don’t suddenly become
gay at a sleepover.

347
00:20:41.389 --> 00:20:45.590
We’ve always been sharing affection with
friends of the same gender in some way or

348
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.590
another.

349
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.289
However, as we mature through puberty, sex
becomes an option for how we express that

350
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:52.289
affection.

351
00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:55.720
Just because sex-acts with the same gender
are how the straight hegemony qualifies us

352
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.430
as homosexuals—

353
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.159
Just because sex acts between two people of
the same gender are how the straight hegimony

354
00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:07.980
qualifies us as homosexuals, does not mean
that is the beginning and end of what we are.

355
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:13.460
One of the misconceptions the straights seem
to have is due to a misunderstanding of the

356
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.889
term: homosexual.

357
00:21:14.889 --> 00:21:19.840
They seem to read it as if the key element
to being gay is sex, how we want to have it,

358
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.330
and who we have it with.

359
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.490
When in reality, sex is the common ground
we share with straight people.

360
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.770
Heterosexuals.

361
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.049
We have sex with people who we are attracted
to (if we’re lucky) the difference is who

362
00:21:31.049 --> 00:21:32.790
we are attracted to.

363
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.410
So no, there is no ‘age’ where it’s
appropriate to be gay, because there is no

364
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.260
age when we're suddenly gay when we weren't
before.

365
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.350
And saying that fictional characters are too
young to be gay — I am sorry — that’s

366
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.390
homophobic.

367
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.169
Take, for instance, the fish boys, again.

368
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:52.610
That’s the one that’s really gotten under
my skin for some reason.

369
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.950
You had otherwise supportive allies saying
that this story wasn’t gay.

370
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.950
Absolutely not gay.

371
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:58.950
No no no.

372
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:59.950
No gay.

373
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.950
No gay, nogaynogay.

374
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.760
But that it could be, if they were a few years
older.

375
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.410
Me, a former, openly gay 12 year-old — from
a small community no less — can’t really…

376
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.760
wrap my head around that thought process.

377
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.580
You telling me I wasn’t *allowed* to be
gay, much less openly gay for another what?

378
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.580
Four years?

379
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.580
6 years?

380
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.679
Tell me the hard cutoff age for when it’s
okay to be gay and I will find you someone

381
00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:21.860
that says it should be higher.

382
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.580
We’ve got… lawmakers in the southern states
saying that you shouldn’t be legally allowed

383
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.860
to say you’re trans until you’re 28.

384
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.960
No, that’s a bad argument.

385
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.940
Because it sets up a hierarchy of sexuality.

386
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.330
If 10 is too young to be gay, the implication
is that you are straight.

387
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.380
This line of thinking is built off an argument
which depicts ‘straight’ as the default

388
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.799
— and gay is a mutation on that default.

389
00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:48.520
Putting an age on gayness or transness — whether
it’s how old you can be before you can see

390
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.440
yourself in media, or how old you can be before
coming out — is presenting a world where

391
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.730
that is an abnormality against the ‘natural’
state of being straight.

392
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.770
And I realize that many straight people who
argue against having gay characters in children’s

393
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.390
media may not explicitly feel this way.

394
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:12.160
But this statement is built off of those homophobic
beliefs that underpin their oppinions.

395
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.750
Which itself is a leftover value of Christian
Puritanism, which has enjoyed a fabulously

396
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.590
prolific cultural monopoly over Europe, and
by proxy, the Americas, since the fall of

397
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.049
the Western Roman Empire.

398
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:28.580
This puratinsim is defined by an avid rejection
of non-christian values.

399
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.670
Specifically sex.

400
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.269
This repulsion of sex and sexuality in all
branches of life, has historically set up

401
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:37.830
specifically restrictive enviroments for women
and all queer people.

402
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:44.159
People who conform to puritan values usually
reject sexuality on principal, so it’s exceptionally

403
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:47.740
difficult to explain human sociology or science
to them.

404
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:53.080
And, as homosexuals and bisexuals are mistakenly
separated from straight puritan values on

405
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.340
merrits of sex alone, they understand us as
nothing more than sexual deviants and perverts.

406
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:07.429
As there is nothing more to us than sex, they
fear and reject us the way they fear and reject

407
00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:08.520
sex itself.

408
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.010
To that end, I realize that when audiences
rush to Disney’s defence to say ‘Disney

409
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:19.840
can’t show the kids gay people’ they are
parroting centuries worth of cultural indoctrination.

410
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.630
That said, protecting children from the gays
is a relatively new phenomenon.

411
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.330
Anti-gay propaganda has only been focused
at protecting children since legal processes

412
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.620
in society have become more secular.

413
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.299
As we could no longer justify actions solely
on what God feels is morally reprehensible,

414
00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:41.150
other arguments needed to exist to justify
guilt to a court of law.

415
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.669
And from here, arose the belief that we had
to protect children from the sodomites, lest

416
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:51.210
the child become corrupted… and also become
a sodomite…

417
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.250
Simply by the knowledge that it was an option.

418
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:58.210
Which says to me something very telling about
the way European ancestors saw sex and sexuality.

419
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:03.289
If someone could be corrupted to be gay simply
by the knowledge that it was possible, shouldn’t

420
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:07.840
that suggest that our antiquated forebears
understood how easy it could be for a man

421
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.549
— any man — to slip into gay thoughts.

422
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:15.690
Or women... but historical legal and scientific
documents did remarkably little to leave records

423
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:20.110
of women when it didn’t directly relate
to how they affected a man’s life.

424
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:28.330
This, to me, suggests that on some level,
these lawmakers were aware that gay thought

425
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.970
and actions were somehow natural.

426
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:36.230
And that in order to keep people away from
them, they needed a very artificial network

427
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:41.679
of shutting queers out of everyday life to
protect the next generation from opening the

428
00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.850
floodgates to gay.

429
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:50.509
If gayness was unnatural, the human race would
not have required such a stringent and organized

430
00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:52.960
effort to stop us from being gay.

431
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.450
We’d just… not be gay.

432
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.549
Like we are told not to be.

433
00:25:56.549 --> 00:26:01.600
Because there’s certainly isn’t very much
formative media that’s telling us that it’s

434
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.450
okay to be gay.

435
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:11.380
Gay children, trans children, nonbinary children,
and all queer children are allowed to exist.

436
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.190
And I think a lot of them need to hear that
message.

437
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.350
But consider for a second, being a gay ten-year
old.

438
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.350
You know you’re gay.

439
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.299
You’ve known you’re gay for some time.

440
00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:21.590
Your parents know you’re gay.

441
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.340
But some movie critic on YouTube is saying
that movie characters your age can’t be

442
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340
gay.

443
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340
Because they’re not old enough.

444
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.059
But to this young person, they internalize
the way that when society looks at them, all

445
00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:36.250
they see is the action of being gay.

446
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.570
This is still the age when kids think kissing
is gross and they’re already being judged

447
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.380
by a purity squad.

448
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.780
Consider how that internalizes this sexual
shame.

449
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:51.149
Not even out of the gate and there’s a deep-seeded
hang up around sex because puritin America

450
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:53.580
has passed on it’s fear of sex.

451
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.769
Now… consider this same child but in a home
where their parents do not know they are gay.

452
00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:03.020
And where that element of self would not be
welcome among their family or community.

453
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.269
And then consider if this child is trans instead
— one of the most vulnerable groups of the

454
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:08.269
queer community.

455
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:12.880
And all the while, media constantly berates
the public — saying these are things not

456
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.340
suitable to be portrayed to all audiences.

457
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:20.230
To this child, the messaging that they’re
receiving through media signals is that there’s

458
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.809
something inherently wrong with them, who
they are.

459
00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:26.970
Queer children aren’t so inherently different
that they don’t deserve to be able to see

460
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:32.279
themselves without having to write a thesis
paper on why Rya is a lesbian.

461
00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:38.340
Nobody’s asking for any explicit acts of
sexuality to be in a film directed at children.

462
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.110
And contrary to popular belief, boys don’t
need to ‘kiss’ or go any further than

463
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.820
that in order for it to be an adequate display
of identity.

464
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.730
Because there is more to homosexuality than
sex.

465
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:56.549
And if you, a straight person or even a gay
person cannot tell the difference, please

466
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:59.460
begin making steps to change your thinking.

467
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.629
Every year, the demographic of ‘LGBTQ Youth’
increases.

468
00:28:04.629 --> 00:28:08.659
Every year, the number of adults who identify
as bi-or-pansexual increases.

469
00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:13.700
This isn’t an issue that’s going to go
away and soon there will be an even greater

470
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.769
demand to see these people as human beings
with different social perspectives, rather

471
00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:22.379
than sexual deviants.

472
00:28:22.379 --> 00:28:23.379
And Disney?

473
00:28:23.379 --> 00:28:27.880
They’ve gone out of their way to establish
themselves as the largest producer not only

474
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.899
of children's’ media — but maybe even
just media in general.

475
00:28:32.899 --> 00:28:37.190
Disney has more cultural sway over global
media than any other single institution on

476
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:42.230
the planet – especially given how ubiquitous
their formative material is.

477
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.460
Disney has a hand in shaping the coming culture
of the world.

478
00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.020
I’d say they have a pretty big obligation
to fight back against the repressive purity

479
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.039
values that are still internalizing shame
in children.

480
00:28:56.039 --> 00:29:01.210
Against the illogical puritan fear fear of
sex and it's even more illogical connection

481
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.539
to gay people.

482
00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:08.650
So their active silence of the it’s-okay-to-be-gay
topic is beginning to echo louder than if

483
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.379
they just came out condemning non-straight,
non-cis identities.

484
00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:16.900
It’s like they think they’re being sneaky,
but they’re not.

485
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.990
Even younger people are beginning to pick
up on it.

486
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:25.360
If we want the next generation of lesbians,
gays, bis, and trans people to grow up feeling

487
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.460
normal, we need to stop putting conditions
and age restrictions on their very identities.

488
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.960
And it starts with us — the audiences — deciding
that we’re not going to tolerate this clear

489
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.490
cultural division between straight and everything
else.

490
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:48.679
This isn’t a phase, it’s not a condition,
it’s not a choice, and it’s not a development.

491
00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:57.360
We’re never going to be able to be who we
are, if everyone else expects us to be what

492
00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:35.940
they’re afraid of.
