00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.920
Pirates are a bit of a mystery, in their personal 
lives. Which is probably why they maintain such  

2
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.840
a hold on our media. Unfortunately, however, the 
golden age of piracy coincided with the golden age  

3
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.240
of English illiteracy, so what we know about them 
is largely left open to anti-pirate propaganda.  

4
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
What’s left is mostly historic accounts 
from scholars who have risen through the  

5
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.680
ranks through academic institutions because they 
think following the rules is the coolest thing.

6
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.560
Suffice to say, the majority of de-mystified 
pirate content is owed to modern historians  

7
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.640
reading between the lines. While pirates are 
often depicted as foul-smelling sea-barbarians,  

8
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.160
this is only partially true. Piracy has 
always been an issue around the world,  

9
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.800
though the early 1700s hit differently.

10
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
During this period of ongoing cultural genocide, 
post-war soldier unemployment, escalating trade  

11
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.000
warfare, and homeland european unrest due 
to the diminishing power of the monarchs  

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.560
resulting in european naval powers having a 
diminished capacity to react to martial threats,  

13
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.000
piracy flourished to the point of not only 
being profitable, but developing an ideology.

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.520
Existing primarily in the North 
and South American colonies,  

15
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.080
some of the more successful pirate captains 
took it upon themselves to fill in the gaps  

16
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.640
left by the English crown and finance well-needed 
social institutions. Pirate raids funded schools,  

17
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.360
hospitals, and infrastructure. I have heard 
pirates be described as primaeval leftists, and…  

18
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.920
well that really depends on some 
people’s definition of ‘leftism.’
 

19
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.120
Prolific pirate captains, such as Blackbeard 
and his contemporaries, leaned into a kind of  

20
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.280
radical social rejection of conventionally-held 
bureaucratic government structures. Their actions  

21
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.120
advocated for a liberation from that conventional 
society, in lieu of personal freedoms.

22
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.480
Whether or not they explicitly would 
have propagated this is case-by-case.  

23
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.080
Some pirates were, as naval officers, highly 
educated. But it may have also been true that  

24
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.840
they just wanted to shout ‘caw the police’ 
as loud as they could across the ocean,  

25
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.480
without necessarily being able to 
articulate why the police required a cawing.

26
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.320
Fast forward to the 2020s  

27
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.120
and pirates have basically been adopted as 
impromptu mascots of learn’d history queers.

28
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.760
Which is funny because, this is an 
era where the English were tossing  

29
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.680
around homophobic slurs at anyone 
they were even slightly annoyed by.  

30
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.160
However, the english rarely labelled 
pirates as being homosexual ‘perverts.’

31
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.400
I read this as the fact that many English 
pirates were former naval officers  

32
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.480
and soldiers. Given that the English colonial 
strategy was conquering the world by sending  

33
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.400
wave-after-wave of boys plucked out of 
discriminated underclasses, the british  

34
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.480
labelling pirates as homosexuals may have encited 
more British soldiers to mutiny than already did.

35
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.760
Fun fact: willful military recruitment thrives in  

36
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.560
situations where poor people believe they 
have no other option to attain a good life.

37
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.400
Right! We were fast-forwarding 
to 2020. 2022 specifically,  

38
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.920
where a television program about funky 
gay pirates is sweeping the seven seas.

39
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.440
So we’re entering into the era of media where 
studio and network executives are just throwing  

40
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.680
money at projects attached to Tika Waititi 
in the hopes that he knows what he’s doing.

41
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.200
Spoiler alert:

42
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.360
He knows what he’s doing.

43
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.120
Granted, of course, all due credit 
to David Jenkins, the show’s creator.  

44
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.760
But I feel like having Watiti’s 
name on the project certainly  

45
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.280
helped turn some executive heads at 
the network. He’s got a track record.

46
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480
80s-themed comic book norse gods? We’re good!

47
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.520
Socially-awkward camp vampires with weirdly 
competent practical and digital special effects?  

48
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.960
Got it covered!

49
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.000
Imaginary friend Reltih? Nailed it. Oddly.

50
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.160
A 1717 sitcom about queer pirates 
with modern sensebilities?  

51
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.840
Loosely based on a true story? Well, we can 
cross that off the planet earth bucket list.

52
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.440
Ugh… I really should be careful. 
It’s dangerous to Stan these days…

53
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.600
I can’t understand, though I’m not complaining, 
why this idea got funding. Period pieces  

54
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.240
themselves are incredibly expensive. But by some 
miracle of executive competence, we have this.

55
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.760
Our Flag Means Death!  

56
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.800
Here to make up for centuries of 
tragically heterosexual pirate content!

57
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.680
And fantastic that it’s like… 
got actual queer representation.  

58
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.000
The Revenge (their ship) is a fantastic microcosm 
of queer spaces. So we get representation,  

59
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.200
and content that allegorically speaks 
to our present state of queerness.  

60
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.040
And everyone loves it. The 
internet has gone nuts for this!

61
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.480
Go figure that when you put queer people 
in media that’s actually entertaining,  

62
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.720
it can turn a buck because people 
want to watch it. Hot take:  

63
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.920
‘audiences’ don’t care if something’s queer 
or not, they care if something’s good or not.

64
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.400
*ahem* DISNEY.

65
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.680
The central pirates in the show are a 
ragtag collection of weirdos and misfits  

66
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.440
who sail together because they 
don’t really have any other options.  

67
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.360
They tolerate and even encourage each-other’s 
eccentricities. There are two kissing gay couples,  

68
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.800
one nonbinary they/them character, an alluded 
third gay romance. And a bunch of just… weirdos.

69
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.480
And though the cast of these weirdos 
tolerate theatrics, violence, seagulls,  

70
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.960
and all manner of things that could 
be considered ‘uncivilised,’ what  

71
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.480
these pirates struggle with is 
the British society gentleman.

72
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.440
Stede Bonnet — er… Captain Stede Bonnet is the 
central character of the series. Having lived  

73
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.280
a life of monotony, dreaming of adventure and 
freedom, he decides to abandon his estate and  

74
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.920
family to go be a Pirate. He hires a crew of 
anyone desperate or foolish enough to sign on,  

75
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.880
and pays them a monthly salary out of the 
fraction of his fortune that he kept for himself.

76
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.320
Among a comune of outsiders, the British gentleman  

77
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.520
is the outsider. His effeminate, lavish 
needs for base-level comfort is seen at  

78
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.080
odds with a life of roughing it on the high 
seas. While the crew is initially annoyed  

79
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.040
by Captain Bonnet, they appreciate him more as 
he stops pretending to be something he’s not.

80
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.680
Which… may be the primary message of the entire 
first season. Who you are, where you belong,  

81
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.400
and whether or not you need to justify being 
there. And if we DO look at the Pirate community  

82
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.680
as an allegory for the queer community, then a 
theme of belonging carries strong significance.

83
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.400
Throughout the show, there are people who try to 
insist that some people are meant to be pirates,  

84
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.360
and other people are just not. Stede, however, 
seems incapable of picking up on the implication  

85
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.320
that he is not meant to be a pirate, in spite 
of all evidence pointing to that conclusion.

86
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.960
However, even though Stede started out as 
a fail-pirate (and… you know by the end of  

87
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.280
the first season he’s not aces), his crew 
isn’t getting 10s across the board either.  

88
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.920
The pirates of The Revenge don’t exactly have 
their crap together. I mean sure, they leaned  

89
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.720
toward that bloodthirsty pirate stereotype that’s 
so damaging to the community in the first episode.  

90
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.280
But they simmer down pretty quick.

91
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:21.920
But through Captain Bonnet’s very… soft… approach 
to pirating, he afforded them an environment where  

92
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.800
they did not need to be trapped in ‘survival’ 
mode. Having a base salary for existing is,  

93
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.720
believe it or not, a great first step to 
helping people focus on self-improvement.

94
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.000
Additionally, through Stede’s 
emotionally-intelligent approach to  

95
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.480
conflict mediation and human resource management, 
his pirate ship becomes a healthy environment  

96
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.720
to help these troubled men and others to 
flourish outside their survival instinct.

97
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.800
Various crew members take up hobbies, 
hone their existing skills, and develop  

98
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.160
meaningful friendships and romances with each 
other. They don’t… really do much pirating—

99
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.920
BUT…

100
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.000
They’re growing as human beings, 
as a family, and as a community.

101
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.120
And this is an interesting 
little parallel to queer spaces,  

102
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.320
and a bit poignient, I think. Queer communities, 
as they had been, historically, primarily composed  

103
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.840
of people who came from homophobic families 
to the point of child abuse and torture,  

104
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.080
may be lacking for… well-adjusted people.

105
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.560
A huge utility of queer communities, and 
especially the house system in urban centres,  

106
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.240
was to function as support groups and 
surrogate families. People in these  

107
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.120
communities could relate to each other, and 
find support as they needed to keep surviving.

108
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.800
Though Stede Bonnet was late to coming out as a 
pirate, the coping mechanisms he had developed for  

109
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.920
preserving himself emotionally was a benefit 
to his crew. And I mean… yeah if your life  

110
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.800
is locked in a state of survival, you’re 
going to neglect your emotional wellbeing.

111
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.440
However, when the rhetoric of society is focused 
almost exclusively on pushing a survival-geared  

112
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.280
narrative of how you should live your life, 
what value does emotional fulfilment have?  

113
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.120
Especially when children in otherwise good 
homes grow up being taught that their value  

114
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.680
to society hinges solely on their ability to earn 
a paycheck from insert-formless-corporation here.

115
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.920
People will put themselves in horrible working 
situations for the sake of ‘survival.’ When  

116
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.560
you believe that ‘survival’ alone is the most 
important thing to work for, there is a whole  

117
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.520
lot that gets pushed off to the side. If an 
unemployed person even vocalises their need for  

118
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.560
fulfilment outside of finding a job, they may be 
met with aggression from society or even family.

119
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.600
Which… I’ve never known what the 
point of surviving is just for the  

120
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.080
opportunity to survive some more. Like. Okay, 
you survive. What next? Survive again tomorrow?  

121
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.400
And when you survive that, you just have 
to survive some more. When do you start  

122
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.600
LIVING? When do you get to stop surviving 
and when do you get to enjoy your survival?

123
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.480
Nobody’s gonna give you a survival award. “Hooray.  

124
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.400
You filled the needs of an employer who would 
replace you with a robot if they could.”

125
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.120
The devaluing of fulfilment is something that 
can be exploited. If social values direct  

126
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.720
us to forgo fulfilment and self-actualization 
until the mystical age of retirement which keeps  

127
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.800
getting older, then we, individuals, can be 
convinced into doing anything for ‘survival.’

128
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.880
Those on the top of the heap can 
generate a scarcity of comfort,  

129
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.920
which survivors will do anything to get at.

130
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.000
Nothing really freaks out the wealthy and 
social elites like people whose identities  

131
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.080
and sources of fulfilment fall outside the 
typical, established channels of survival.  

132
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.600
Which is another reason why social structures 
seek to limit the permissible range of identities,  

133
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.240
and reject and persecute those who 
fall outside the typical identity pool.

134
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.520
Which is why you had a situation like the golden 
age of piracy, where otherwise ‘properly groomed’  

135
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.320
soldiers, officers, merchants, and freelance 
sailors would abandon the Crown Values of  

136
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.680
europe in lieu of a rock-n’-roll, live fast, live 
free, die horribly and probably on fire lifestyle.  

137
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.080
There was, in the world of piracy, an available 
space where improper sensibilities had value.

138
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.080
And it really just… it was a nightmare for British 
industry, for Spanish Genocide, and for the  

139
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.280
French… in… general.

140
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.520
And that’s why I’m perfectly comfortable comparing 
baroque piracy to queer communities of the modern  

141
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:19.520
world. Only with… less murder. Less pillaging. 
Theft… sure. Alcoholism. Comparable theatrics.

142
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.960
We definitely have more glitter though. 
Which is actually really bad for the  

143
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.720
environment — did… piracy have a smaller 
eco-footprint than the gay community?

144
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.000
You know who wouldn’t go 
a-fracking? Blackbeard. That’s who.

145
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.680
Piracy, as an ‘occupation’ or even ‘identity’  

146
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.960
is something that European naval forces launched 
extensive propaganda campaigns to prevent.  

147
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.160
Ships’ commanders progressively 
squeezed their crews tighter,  

148
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.920
which led to more mutinies, which led to more 
pirates who decided to make their own societies.

149
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.680
Yes, piracy was a game of brutal survival, 
but it was seen as preferable to survive on  

150
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.560
one’s own terms, rather than existing as 
just another cog in the machine, unnamed,  

151
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.560
unknown, printing money and creating comfort 
for someone else. Hordes of (usually) men  

152
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.160
abandoned the society that had convinced 
them to live their lives in a certain way,  

153
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
opting for a life of crime and 
probably a public execution,  

154
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.040
simply for the opportunity to be able to 
live freely — to express their own identity.

155
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.480
And yes a lot of them were…  

156
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.760
not great people. So that really didn’t help their 
public outreach. But then again, people who have  

157
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.640
worked in contact centres may have the same to 
say about middle-management. So again it’s like  

158
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.600
choosing between the socially-acceptable 
sociopath overlords vs. the outlaws.

159
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.120
After working the daily grind long enough… 
eventually you’re going to pick the one  

160
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.920
who's going to let you howl at the moon. 
Or howl WITH you. What is ‘going crazy’ if  

161
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.440
not the lucid inability to reconcile the natural 
absurdity of modernity which we take for granted  

162
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.760
as civilization, and our own repressed needs for 
fulfilment outside the confines of said society?

163
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.440
Just dive into the crazy. If not now, then when?

164
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.840
Which brings us back to Stede Bonnet. Baby Bonnet. 
Captain bonnet. This boy. Baby captain boy-bonnet.

165
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.360
…Ed’s bitch.

166
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.000
Stede’s pirate-identity and/or queer-identity 
is linked to a mid-life crisis where he  

167
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.680
decided he couldn’t live his life 
anymore. Married with two children,  

168
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.560
he felt as if he was growing immeasurably distant 
from them. There was no chemistry, there was no  

169
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.720
joy. He and his wife went along with things 
because they felt that this was all they had.

170
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.200
From Stede’s perspective, the struggle with 
queerness is rooted in the issue of coming  

171
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.160
out late in life. Which, believe it or not — in 
spite of the hordes of media about being a queer  

172
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.080
teenager, late-bloomers still exist. Our Flag 
Means Death takes an individual who has endured  

173
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.360
complex trauma for most of his childhood, and 
has been badgered out of his personal identity.

174
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.320
Young Stede being in a state at home where 
his father despised his natural identity,  

175
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.560
and being at boarding school where he had 
‘natural victim’ tattooed on his forehead.  

176
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.440
Bullying like that can do a lot of things to 
someone, and it’s not out of the question that  

177
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.400
it would generate a person whose psychological 
state is rooted in keeping their head down and  

178
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.200
hoping everything passes over. Stede was never 
really encouraged to pursue what he wanted,  

179
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.800
because there was never a point in his life where 
he was rewarded for expressing himself honestly.

180
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.280
To him, it was made clear, both deliberately by 
his father, and latently through his peer group,  

181
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.600
that his sense of fulfilment fell well 
outside the socially-acceptable ways for  

182
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.760
a man of the 18th century to exist. What 
could not be done through direct lessons  

183
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.920
and formal conditioning was accomplished 
through a complex, pavlovian gauntlet  

184
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.400
of aggressive bullying tactics and consequences 
for social nonconformity that we call ‘childhood.’

185
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.960
These ideas of conformity to social 
order are innate to human development,  

186
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.600
and detrimental to our species survival 
past beating snakes with rocks in trees.  

187
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.480
And it’s pivotal that we develop communities 
and actively seek out common ground with  

188
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.520
other human beings and communities. 
However, this sense of conformity  

189
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:16.160
can be very easily hijacked by a morally ambiguous 
class of social superiors who twist a definition  

190
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.840
of social order to suit their own personal 
needs, rather than benefit humanity at large.

191
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.600
SO.

192
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.280
For those of us who seek identity 
and fulfilment outside these  

193
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.320
hierarchically-defined predetermined channels,  

194
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.560
we often need to find ways to preserve our sense 
of self while ‘surviving.’ And yes, some of us  

195
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.520
may be partial to skipping through steps A, B, 
and C-through-G and go straight to moon-howling.

196
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.640
Which… you know. In today’s economy 
that’s not an invalid option.  

197
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.800
I’m sure someone would pay me 
to howl at the moon for them.

198
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.240
But many of us, like Stede Bonnet, run the mental 
gymnastics needed to find a way to exist within  

199
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.160
society in spite of… that simply being not what 
you are. Stede, specifically, used the classic  

200
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.560
technique of procedurally minimising himself to 
the point where he barely existed in his own life.

201
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:17.280
The more you retreat from your life, the less of 
you have to actually tolerate that miserable life.

202
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.960
You kinda learn to… drift along. Exist where 
it’s necessary but for the most part you  

203
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.560
don’t really have a whole lot of awareness of 
yourself. Or other people. Or years going by…  

204
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.280
in a pandemic where your body is ageing 
but your mind is still in your twenties…

205
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
[Dissociate.]

206
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.320
But before you know it you have a wife. A 
house. A family. A family that you’re not  

207
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.040
aware why you have or what to do with it aside 
from society telling you that you should have it.

208
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.520
What could POSSIBLY go wrong with that?

209
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.520
Very healthy marriage!

210
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.360
It’s abundantly clear that Stede  

211
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.400
doesn’t really fit in with the family life. 
He’s kind of looked at as this weird obstruction  

212
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.520
to normal living by his wife and kids. He 
only really connects with his children when  

213
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.680
he’s playing adventure games with them — 
otherwise they’re kinda put off by him.

214
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.960
His wife, on the other hand, has all but resolved 
entirely to put up with him. It doesn’t seem like  

215
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:20.160
she really… dislikes Stede. But it is clear 
that she is just as repressed as he is.  

216
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.600
Their interests are completely out of sync,  

217
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.440
they have no way of communicating because 
each one is repressing a different identity.

218
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:36.240
She’s a sort of free-love artist who doesn’t need 
a man, who is living the role of the subservient  

219
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.080
housewife because this is the role she 
has been taught to play her whole life  

220
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.400
because that is the only life for a woman to 
live. And Stede is gay. Tale as old as time.

221
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.360
And she GETS to be this strong, fabulous,  

222
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.720
glowing woman once she no long 
HAS to be Mrs. Stede Bonnet.

223
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.640
And even though they can’t really be bothered 
to do anything more than tolerate each other,  

224
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.280
this is apparently how it’s supposed to 
be. The important thing is that you stay  

225
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.640
together — for the children. Or social decency. 
It doesn’t matter if it’s not who you are.

226
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.960
I’m sure forcing kids to grow up in 
nuclear families where both parents are  

227
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.680
ghosts of shells of human beings 
will end up perfectly well-adjusted,  

228
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.360
and never pass along that generational 
trauma. The important thing is staying  

229
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.200
together. Fulfilment is secondary to survival 
— and all you gotta put in is the bare minimum.

230
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.280
The kids won’t notice.

231
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.240
Children: the original participation trophies.

232
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.680
And that attitude hasn’t really 
gone anywhere since 1717.  

233
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:51.840
It’s just as alive and well today as ever. 
Epitomised by another hit streaming comedy.

234
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.760
During my research for this video I found 
a textbook which claimed to be a credible  

235
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.720
source on the topic of queer disocvery being an 
issue in marriages. I wanted to read about the  

236
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.040
straight partner’s side of the experience. But 
it turns out the book was pretty much just a…  

237
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.840
step by step manual about why 
you should divorce your husband  

238
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.560
if he tells you that he’s bisexual. So let’s 
ignore that overpriced piece of biphobia.

239
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.680
Coming out isn’t like flicking a switch or 
moving to a new city. For many queer people,  

240
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.720
coming out can be an evolving process of 
being honest with yourself, then a confidant,  

241
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.600
then family members and classmates or co-workers.

242
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.800
Recently, a number of surveys report that 
queer people are coming out at younger  

243
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.440
ages than ever before as we benefit 
from growing (though not widespread)  

244
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.680
acceptance and better (though not great) 
LGBTQ representation in the media.

245
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.560
But coming out is still generally 
presented as a rite-of-passage for teens  

246
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.040
and maybe twenty-somethings. People who are 
just getting their lives started and have no  

247
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.480
chains attaching them to heterosexuality.

248
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.040
Grace & Frankie is a Netflix series 
that began streaming in May of 2015,  

249
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.200
with its final season premiering this April. 
The show tells the story of the titular  

250
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.120
Grace & Frankie when they’re slapped in the face 
with the realisation that both of their husbands,  

251
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.880
Robert and Saul respectively, have been 
cheating on them for the last twenty years.

252
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.040
With each other.

253
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.120
And since they’re aging into their 
70s, and gay marriage has become legal,  

254
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.040
they think its about time they stop hiding, 
divorce their wives and marry each other.  

255
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.080
Which doesn’t go over 
wonderfully, as you’d expect.

256
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.200
Now this is a sitcom, not a hard boiled 
drama, but I’ve spoken with enough gay  

257
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.680
men of a certain age to know that a lot of the 
more dramatic issues that arise in the show,  

258
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.200
specifically about dealing with husbands 
coming out, are closer to reality than fiction.

259
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.280
As the series goes on the animosity between 
the women and their former husbands does  

260
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.160
die down a bit, leading to them eventually 
becoming friends (at least Frankie and Saul),  

261
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.480
but the first season does little in the 
way of painting a rosy picturesque ending  

262
00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.960
for married couples torn apart by homosexuality 
or, in Saul’s case, likely bisexuality.

263
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.920
The two female leads have contrasting 
reactions to finding out about their  

264
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.040
husbands. Frankie is angry, yes, but mostly sad.  

265
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.880
Her main focus is on keeping her family together. 
While Grace is a ball of anger and resentment.  

266
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.760
Both perfectly valid reactions to finding out that 
the last several decades of life lives were a lie.

267
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.760
Crappy situation all around. The 
kids are angry at their fathers, but  

268
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.960
feel like they can’t be angry because their 
gay, and they need to be happy for them.  

269
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.800
That they can finally come out and be their 
true selves, even though they kind of hate  

270
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.520
them at the moment for tearing their families 
asunder and breaking their mother’s hearts.

271
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.720
But the show doesn’t act like Robert and Saul 
are the worst people in the world, either.

272
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.360
Outing yourself late in life can be complicated 
after having lived through times when being  

273
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.640
openly gay could get you fired, arrested, put 
in an institution or given shock treatment.  

274
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.200
It's snarled in a lifetime of trudging 
along through society's views of normalcy  

275
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.880
and the resulting fear of being 
ostracised by everyone you know.  

276
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.320
And it's marked by a nagging doubt that all of 
the heartache you may cause, all of the potential  

277
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.640
for things to just get worse after coming out, 
may not be worth it with one's years numbered.

278
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.840
In the best situation, everyone is 
okay with it and you get to have a  

279
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:21.840
fabulous third act in your life. But in 
the worst situation your entire family,  

280
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.400
spouse, children, grandchildren, might 
never want to speak to you again.  

281
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.400
Not because of homophobia but because they 
feel you’ve been lying to them for decades.

282
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.600
Finding out that the partner you believed to be 
straight is actually gay can be traumatizing.  

283
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.200
Especially in long term relationships. This can be 
beyond difficult for the straight person involved.

284
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.640
They can internalized the sexual 
rejection, feel like you’ve become  

285
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.560
gay because they weren’t good 
enough, have a cratering self-image,  

286
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.720
and increased anxiety about what 
else you’ve been hiding from them.

287
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.720
And I’m not even taking into account the 
spouses of people who come out as transgender  

288
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.520
because that’s a whole other can of worms. And is,  

289
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.160
at least from my gay millennial point 
of view, a lot more complicated.

290
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.760
Coming out as gay has been at least on the 
periphery of acceptable since the 1990s,  

291
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.480
and well before that depending 
upon where you lived and what  

292
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.080
your family was like. But coming out 
as trans, even to this day, can be  

293
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.640
fraught with any number of social and legal 
issues. So let’s focus on the cis’s here.

294
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.160
Some people have described the 
discovery that their spouse is gay  

295
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.000
as something akin to finding out that 
they’ve died. But there’s a very important  

296
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.840
difference in the situation. When a spouse dies 
you have to grieve them and eventually, hopefully,  

297
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.240
move on to live the rest of your life.

298
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.840
But in the situation of a 
spouse coming out of the closet,  

299
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.560
you’re mourning the loss for yourself while 
possibly seeing them flourish in a new happy  

300
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.000
relationship with someone they actually want to 
be with. Someone who, at least to your own eyes,  

301
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.960
isn’t a consolation prize, but what 
they were hoping for all along.

302
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.240
That kind of thing can be pretty traumatic, 
especially for older people like Grace and  

303
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:14.720
Frankie who, likely, assumed til death 
do us part was a given at their age.

304
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.640
So staying in the closet and attempting to live a 
straight life, while the social norm, may end up  

305
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.800
causing more damage than you ever thought. It’s 
not just your own inability to live openly that  

306
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.280
is hindered, causing yourself emotional distress, 
but inevitably creates trauma for your loved ones.

307
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.560
While some spouses do end up being supportive 
in the end, others are driven in the opposite  

308
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.360
direction. Beginning to support things like 
conversion therapy in hopes that no other woman,  

309
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.800
or man, will have to go through the possibly 
life-destroying experience that they have.

310
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.280
That’s an extreme case, of course, and most 
marriages that end with one partner coming out  

311
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.760
usually just end up as a messy divorce. But the 
longer you stay in that straight relationship, the  

312
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.840
more painful it becomes when you leave it. Decades 
of marriage, with children and grandchildren… it’s  

313
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.720
much harder than just breaking up and revealing 
to your girlfriend that you actually like boys.  

314
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.480
Or if you’re a lesbian, letting your 
boyfriend know that you actually like girls.

315
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.280
Well, knowing straight guys, that interaction will 
probably end with them asking for a threesome.

316
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.640
But it takes a drastic shift away from “I turned 
him gay” jokes when you’re in your twenties…  

317
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.600
to life altering circumstances if 
the coming out happens later in life.  

318
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.960
It’s almost cruel to hold an opposite sex partner  

319
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.520
hostage in a marriage while you work 
up the courage to be your true self.

320
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.800
Coming out is almost always frightening, and 
certainly doesn’t get any easier with age,  

321
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.480
but I think we should take the lives and 
feelings of the people we’re keeping in the  

322
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.160
dark into consideration. They deserve 
to live their lives to the fullest,  

323
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.720
not just as your arm candy to 
the country club or Sunday mass.

324
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.040
It isn’t just the emotional impact you 
might have on your wife or husband though.  

325
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:05.840
There’s a very real, and very deadly, 
impact you might have on yourself.

326
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.720
In the early 1990s a study was 
conducted by doctors at UCLA to  

327
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.240
study the health of HIV negative gay 
and bisexual men. By estimates about  

328
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.520
half of the men were in the closet at 
the time, and the other half were out.

329
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.520
The occurrence of cancer and moderate to severe 
infections increased in direct proportion to  

330
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.040
the degree to which participants 
concealed their sexual identity.  

331
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.160
Surveyed infectious diseases included pneumonia, 
bronchitis, tuberculosis, and most cancers.  

332
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.600
None of these effects could be attributed to 
differences in demographic characteristics  

333
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.480
(such as age, ethnicity, occupation, or 
education), health-relevant behavioural  

334
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.360
patterns (like drug use, exercise, or 
sleep disruption), depression, or anxiety.

335
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.520
These findings replicated the results of 
an earlier study documenting accelerated  

336
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.560
progression of HIV infections among gay or 
bisexual men who were not out of the closet.  

337
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.720
These findings were also consistent with data 
from a 1974 research study that measured both  

338
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:28.480
the concealment of one’s sexuality, and 
the occurrence of 15 psychosomatic symptoms  

339
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.440
(such as tremors, headache, loss of appetite, 
upset stomach, weight loss, heart palpitations,  

340
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.000
dizziness, and sleep disturbance). Analysis 
of the data they reported indicated that  

341
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.760
"closeted" gay or bisexual men were more 
than twice as likely to show these symptoms.

342
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.040
These were only two of many studies over the last 
few decades that saw a correlation between being  

343
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.960
in the closet and becoming ill, physically and 
psychologically. Attributed to the incredible  

344
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.400
stress placed on closeted individuals to 
keep their identity hidden at all costs.

345
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.560
But it’s not only illness that can come about from 
being in the closet. It’s physical danger as well.  

346
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.840
Closeted men were always less likely to 
have friends in the local queer community,  

347
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.600
and therefore wouldnt be in the know about 
what rent boys would steal from them or, worse,  

348
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.400
leave them bleeding out in 
some cheap room somewhere.

349
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.960
In the 1980s and 90s, being in the 
closet could mean certain death.  

350
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.720
While gay and bisexual men were 
finding out about the HIV virus,  

351
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.360
creating support groups, and eventually learning 
that condoms could slow the spread of the disease,  

352
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.800
closeted men from the suburbs 
were blissfully unaware,  

353
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.400
or at least under aware, of the dangerous virus 
circulating throughout America’s major cities.

354
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.560
And once and a while they would find themselves 
travelling into those cities from their nice  

355
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.320
suburban homes and their happy homemaker wives to 
meet up with a leather daddy or particularly cute  

356
00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:00.720
twink they kept around for when their pretend 
heterosexuality became too mundane and boring.  

357
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.520
But these casual sexual partners weren’t always 
safe, with them or anyone else they had sex with.

358
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.240
They might have been infected, and might 
pass the virus off to these married men  

359
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.200
to bring home to the suburbs with them. And, in 
some very unfortunate circumstances, then pass the  

360
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.560
disease on to their completely unknowing wives. 
This was a horror story back in the day, meant to  

361
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:31.440
demonize bisexual men in particular. But it wasn’t 
just bisexuals hiding in closets. Plenty of gay  

362
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.280
men were just as deeply hidden in the shadows, 
between Ralph Lauren polos and Gucci neck ties.

363
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.720
Theft and murder were also frequent in known queer 
areas of a city. Theft; because it would be easy  

364
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.440
to get a man’s pants off and steal everything he’s 
got before running away. And murderers would hang  

365
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.560
around looking for their next victim because 
if a body was found in the gay areas of town,  

366
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.480
it wouldnt be likely that the cops 
would do a whole lot of digging to  

367
00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.400
find out who took them out. Just one 
less queer they had to worry about.

368
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.400
An infamous example of this was 
the serial killer Ronald Dominique,  

369
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.440
who murdered twenty three men in south eastern 
Louisiana between the years of 1997 and 2006.  

370
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.680
The reason he was able to go about his sick 
hobby for so long was because he was targeting  

371
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.200
poor black men who were either gay, or sex workers 
willing to go home with a man for the right price.

372
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.560
Looking back in history the closet was ALSO  

373
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:32.560
a vice used to trap men in legal proceedings. 
Take for instance the trials of Oscar Wilde.

374
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.400
Wilde, who was in a long affair with Alfred 
Douglas, was not taken down by blackmail or  

375
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.360
bad press, as he long expected he would be, 
but by his lover’s ill-tempered and mentally  

376
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.200
imbalanced father, The Marquess of Queensbury. 
By early 1894 Queensberry concluded the Wilde  

377
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.120
was most likely a homosexual and began 
demanding that his son stop seeing Wilde.

378
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.040
He wrote to his son:

379
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.200
"Your intimacy with this man  

380
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.520
Wilde must either cease or I will 
disown you and stop all money supplies.”

381
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.840
To which his son replied simply:

382
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.680
"What a funny little man you are.”

383
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.400
Queensberry began taking increasingly 
desperate measures to end the relationship  

384
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.800
such as threatening restaurant and hotel managers 
with beatings if he ever discovered Wilde and his  

385
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.640
son together on their premises. In June of 1894 
Queensberry, accompanied by a prize-fighter,  

386
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:27.200
showed up without warning at Wilde's house 
in Chelsea. An angry conversation ensued,  

387
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.000
ending when Wilde ordered 
Queensberry to leave saying,  

388
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.600
"I do not know what the Queensberry rules are, 
but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight."

389
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.440
On February 14, 1895, Wilde's new play The 
Importance of Being Earnest was set to open at the  

390
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.640
St. James Theatre. Wilde learned that Queensberry 
planned to disrupt the opening night's performance  

391
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.000
and harangue the audience about Wilde's alleged 
decadent lifestyle. To thwart the plan, Wilde  

392
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.040
arranged to have the theatre surrounded by police. 
Blocked by officers from entering the theatre,  

393
00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.440
Queenberry prowled about outside for 
three hours before finally leaving.

394
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.760
Queensberry proceed to spread rumours 
of the affair between his son and Wilde  

395
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.920
all over London. And this is where the closet 
slammed shot directly onto Oscar Wilde’s face  

396
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.280
when he sued the man for libel, 
declaring that he was not  

397
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:22.160
a homosexual and that Queensberry was 
patently lying. All at the urgence of Alfred.

398
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.320
In the opening speech for the defence, 
Queensberry’s lawyer announced that he had  

399
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:34.240
located several male prostitutes who were willing 
to testify that they had had sex with Oscar Wilde.  

400
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.880
Following this declaration, and upon advice 
from his own lawyers, Wilde dropped the charges.

401
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.960
Under the Libel Act of 1843,  

402
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.600
Queensberry's subsequent acquittal rendered 
Wilde legally liable for the considerable  

403
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.880
expenses Queensberry had incurred in his 
legal defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.

404
00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.240
…And also footing the bill for 
every one of Alfred Douglas’ whims.

405
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.800
After Wilde left the court, a warrant 
for his arrest was issued for charges of  

406
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.480
sodomy and gross indecency. To which he was 
eventually found guilty and sent to prison.

407
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:16.480
Oscar Wilde’s closet, as fabulous as I’m sure it 
was, in fact was what lead to his swift downfall  

408
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.680
from a darling of high society, to 
a sodomite sentenced to hard labour.

409
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.800
Of course there should not have been any kind of 
prison sentence for being gay or bisexual, and he  

410
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.600
never should have been put in that situation 
in the first place, but the facts remain.  

411
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.200
It was the closet door that he let hang 
so limply ajar, that led to his downfall.

412
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:47.840
After leaving prison, he died in November of 1900, 
less than five years after being found guilty. 
 
  

413
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.480
I just want to take a second to clarify 
that I kind of am railing a bit against  

414
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.040
heteronormative social structures. I’ve been 
growing concerned, when I cover this topic,  

415
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.560
that people feel like I’m calling them out 
for not being ‘the right kind of queer.’  

416
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.600
Which… no, I’m not doing that.
 
When I rail against heteronormativity,  

417
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.040
even when I’m making a joke out of 
it, I want to clarify that I’m not  

418
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.400
targeting individuals. Having rights as an equal 
citizen means that you ought to have the ability  

419
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.440
to choose how you want to live your life. Suss 
out those wild parties in abandoned warehouses,  

420
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.160
or have a night in after a PTA meeting.
 
I encourage people to be who they are in  

421
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.760
spite of social conditioning. I’m not a fan of 
our society still having these expectations.
  

422
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.800
And I similiarily have no patience for 
queer people who try to gate-keep other  

423
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.160
queer people based on these approved 
queer identities, established for us by  

424
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.720
cisgender heterosexual people.
 
I thought the whole point of queerness is  

425
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.840
that you had permission to be different. We’re not 
really getting rights if those rights come with  

426
00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:00.000
caveats and terms and conditions. An ally who 
holds their morality hostage until we make them  

427
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.120
comfortable, is an ally who has no intention of 
accepting us — but is willing to tolerate us.
  

428
00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.440
If we look at the queer folks who try to badger 
other queer people into hetero-approved checkboxes  

429
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:20.400
of identities, there is an opposing, and perhaps 
even equal group in the queer community that  

430
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.840
tries to do the opposite thing, and badger queer 
people away from that ‘heteronomative’ lifestyle.  

431
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:33.280
Even if it is — and it is perfectly valid if it 
is — the most honest expression of their self.
  

432
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.360
And yes. Our Flag Means Death does have… 
or may have something to say about this?
  

433
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.040
Stede, even though he continues to 
live gentlemanly in spite of being  

434
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.440
the odd one out among his crew, still has 
value in the community and has a place. 
  

435
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:53.040
And the show makes a point of making villains 
out of people who think he is ridiculous,  

436
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.960
and has no right to be a pirate. And, 
perhaps, the primary villain of the show  

437
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.000
is the one who will not shut up about it. 
 
Okay. We get it,  

438
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.320
Izzy. You don’t like embroidery. 
 
Izzy Hands is a character in the show  

439
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.880
based on the historic figure of the same name, who 
was, in fact, the first mate to Blackbeard. Who…  

440
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.480
I don’t know if I've mentioned it yet, but he’s 
also a character in the show! And played by Tika  

441
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:23.760
Watiti. And is totally gay for Stede Bonnet.
 
But you know THAT because the internet has been  

442
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.760
nothing but gay pirate fan art for the last week.
 
Izzy does not like Stede in general, but  

443
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.640
would probably be willing to just kind 
of… ignore him. But what gets under  

444
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.640
his skin is that Blackbeard, his bro, is… 
adopting some of Stede’s eccentricities.
  

445
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:48.160
This is a great symbol because instead of 
being allegory it is, as Tolkien described,  

446
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:55.120
Applicability. Meaning this one object 
or icon (Piracy) has any range of ways  

447
00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.080
it can be reapplied to the real world.
 
Izzy sees Blackbeard’s increasing warmth,  

448
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.520
his growing softness, and his newfound emotional 
intelligence to be the work of Stede Bonnet.  

449
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:12.240
That Bonnet had somehow bewitched Blackbeard. 
Because Izzy’s view of Blackbeard is as the ideal  

450
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.000
pirate, who is cruel, chaotic, rough, and ruthless 
– and he believes that this vision of Blackbeard  

451
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.720
is the true expression of his self. Whereas the 
idiosyncrasies he is borrowing from Stede Bonnet  

452
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:31.520
are nothing more than the tempting and addictive 
soft comforts of conventional society.
  

453
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.880
Stede, as the primary influencer of what Izzy 
may view as ‘normativity of the conventional,’  

454
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.320
must be removed from the community in order to 
keep piracy ‘true’ and ‘pure.’ He’s all about  

455
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.880
that pirate purity. He loves that P.P.
 
In a similar way, gatekeepers tend to  

456
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.960
be married to this language of ‘purity.’ 
You see this all the time in toxic nerd  

457
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.280
communities. Things like separating ‘star 
wars fans’ from ‘TRUE star wars fans.’
  

458
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.440
And out of everyone, it makes no sense to me why 
the queer community has this kind of thing going  

459
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:05.280
on. Some of us left our families because they were 
making demands about who we are and how we express  

460
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.440
ourselves. What’s the point of a found family if 
the family we find does the exact same thing?
  

461
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.520
Blackbeard’s experience with 
identity, despite what Izzy thinks,  

462
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.920
is not too different from Stede’s.
 
Ed Teach did not come from a great home.  

463
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.960
His dad was abusive so he murdered him and 
blamed a sea monster, you know the drill.  

464
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.400
Drawing attention to himself as tough, mean, 
and cold was just as much of a response to  

465
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:35.360
identity suppression as Stede’s introversion. 
Where Stede made a persona that was invisible,  

466
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.480
as Blackbeard, Ed projected a personality 
not only did everyone see plainly,  

467
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.800
but made it clear he was not to be crossed.
 
Both projections succeeded in the same thing:  

468
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.920
keeping people away from the 
truth of their identity.
  

469
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.640
The difference was: Stede decided enough 
was enough, and threw himself out into  

470
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.640
the world ready or not. Could have handled 
the family thing a bit more upfront but… 
  

471
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.400
Blackbeard it seems, was a little 
bit more tender underneath it all.  

472
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.640
In spite of Izzy’s persistence, Blackbeard 
would privately confess his sensitivities,  

473
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.440
and his exhaustion with having to be 
Blackbeard. And how he was simply much  

474
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:21.520
more comfortable as a normal name — as just Ed.
 
In fact when he introduced himself to Stede as Ed,  

475
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.800
I thought it was a joke, and I had 
to look up Blackbeard’s real name.
  

476
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:31.360
The show uses Blackbeard as a SYMBOL and I think 
that lends it a lot of credit to the show.
  

477
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.480
Because Blackbeard was much 
more sensitive than he seemed,  

478
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:42.000
but was putting on a mask for the approval of his 
peer group. He had to hide a truth about himself,  

479
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.520
his sensitivity, his love of fine clothes, and a 
willingness to put his heart on his sleeve — for  

480
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.880
the purpose of blending into an environment.
 
How is this any less of an allegorical closet  

481
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.880
than the one Stede was in?
 
The thing about Izzy is that he  

482
00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.960
doesn’t really care about Blackbeard. He 
doesn’t care about Blackbeard’s sense of  

483
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.840
fulfilment, what he wants out of life, nor how 
Blackbeard would like to express his freedom.
  

484
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.680
Whether or not Blackbeard gets anything out of 
it doesn’t matter. Blackbeard is more important  

485
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:18.880
as an icon for Izzy to use as a representative of 
pirate lifestyle, than whatever fulfilment he may  

486
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:24.240
get out of doing anything else. And this is how 
gatekeepers justify this kind of behaviour — by  

487
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.160
finding some way that enforcing their own 
sensibilities can actually be a moral necessity.
  

488
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:36.160
The sacrifice of Blackbeard’s individuality 
is a necessary one because the utility he  

489
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.600
gets from happiness is less significant than the 
utility his fraudulent personality can provide  

490
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.640
as a role model to other pirates.
 
Queer circles and Our Flag Means  

491
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.960
Death Pirates are communities focused 
around rejecting dishonest lifestyles.  

492
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:56.400
However the fact that we still have to deal with 
internal identity policing indicates that we have  

493
00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.640
not abandoned the components of culture which are 
comfortable with dishonesty in the first place.

494
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.240
Our culture of dishonesty goes a lot deeper than 
I think most people would be willing to admit.  

495
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.000
The messaging of nearly every piece of 
90s media was ‘just be yourself, kids.’  

496
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.840
At which point the programming would outline 
a very specific way to ‘be yourself.’

497
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.200
Conform to nonconformity.

498
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.560
Fast forward to when we’re writing our 
first resume. The advice we get? Lie.

499
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.000
Beef up your work experience. Rebrand your hobbies 
and interests so they sound more impressive.  

500
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.880
Downplay your shortcomings and under NO 
circumstances EVER talk about your disabilities.  

501
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.560
In general.

502
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.960
The very culture in which we are afforded 
success is one which encourages us  

503
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.120
to behave more like robots, and less 
like people. Because people are messy,  

504
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.760
people are flawed. People have problems, 
and hangups, and triggers, and traumas.  

505
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.520
But an employer can justify how any one of 
those things make you an unsuitable employee.  

506
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.840
So these are parts of ourselves that we HAVE 
to conceal. Except Stede. Stede doesn't care.

507
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.720
I mean, when we’re nervous over going into a first 
job interview, and the advice we’re given is ‘just  

508
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.840
be yourself and act natural’ — that advice 
isn’t meant to mean: ‘it’s okay to talk about  

509
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.240
your potential panic attacks.’

510
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.840
So when people say: ‘just be yourself,’ they 
actually mean ‘be the version of yourself  

511
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.400
which is held up to an impossible standard and 
which contains no trace of personal flaws.’  

512
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.800
The pressure to exist as a flawless individual 
in society begins here but doesn’t get better.

513
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.240
Think about the last time you wanted 
something. Doesn’t have to be a job. Maybe  

514
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:54.720
it was an application for a grant, or a bursary 
or scholarship for school. When did an authority  

515
00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.640
figure tell you that in order to get it, it’s 
okay if you had to bend the truth a little bit.

516
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.880
What if it was a student loan. 
And you were asked the question:  

517
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:13.440
“have you ever had depression” or “been 
diagnosed with depression?” Of course you had.  

518
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.160
But banks see depression and 
mental illness as a liability.

519
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.800
So where once we were talking about 
society’s widespread comfort with  

520
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.960
keeping queer people in closets, there 
are a whole lot of other ways that  

521
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.680
society pressures us to conceal elements 
about ourselves. The hilarious part is  

522
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.840
that we’re in a culture which likes to 
pretend like we need to be more open.

523
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.640
But that just ends up with Banks putting out 
promotional material for mental health awareness  

524
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.800
while selling life insurance policies which 
disqualify applicants who have been diagnosed  

525
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:56.800
with depression. Like my mom, who paid into 
an insurance policy with RBC for nine years  

526
00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:03.520
only to have it yanked away from her after her 
death, because in 2014, when she was doing great,  

527
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.920
she forgot to mention that she’d been 
diagnosed with depression in 2005,  

528
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.360
after suffering an injury that 
meant she couldn’t work anymore.

529
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.800
Sorry, but who hasn’t been depressed these 
days? Who isn’t struggling with keeping their  

530
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.760
head above the water? Who doesn’t feel small 
and insignificant when they’re just trying to  

531
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.280
be the change that they want to see in a world 
that’s out of their control? Who doesn’t feel  

532
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:35.440
like they messed up somewhere in life when family 
sitcoms still try to sell the two-car garage and  

533
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:41.120
white picket fence as the ‘standard’ milestone 
for life? When people buy starter homes.

534
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.400
And if this is EVERYONE, then why the 
hell does everyone have to pretend  

535
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.480
like it’s not something that’s happened to them?

536
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.400
Why do we live in a culture where 
you have to act like you're something  

537
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.640
completely different than you are, 
and then end up pissing off friends  

538
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.440
and acquaintances as they begin to learn 
that you’re actually completely different?

539
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:11.520
Why do we have to ‘act our age’ when you turn 
30, because all the other age’d gays badger  

540
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.920
you into beleiving you’re too old to get 
your kicks out of clubbing on the weekend?  

541
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.200
Why do we present introverts as people 
who have nowhere to go on a Friday night,  

542
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.920
rather than people who would actively choose 
to stay in if they could choose anything?

543
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.920
…The short answer is that 
profit-driven media is really  

544
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.240
only capable of depicting a limited 
number of identities because there’s an  

545
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:42.720
unwillingness to experiment with new ideas that 
have not already been shown to be profitable.

546
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.960
Which is why I’m so surprised that 
something like Our Flag Means Death  

547
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.400
made it into production. That a giant media 
conglomerate like Warner Bros. Discovery  

548
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.760
saw fit to okay a budget for a show about a bunch 
of weird, queer pirates who break every convention  

549
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:03.520
of traditional society. Multiple instances of 
queer love, at least one instance of polyamory,  

550
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.520
a ship filled with people of different 
races, and the biggest villain of the show  

551
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.320
is the guy who wants Blackbeard to 
be your typical masculine archetype.

552
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.840
How did this happen? How, in this media landscape  

553
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:24.160
of “first gay characters” and coming 
out stories did we get this show?

554
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.040
In the beginning of the show, when Stede 
first meets Ed, he shows him around his ship.  

555
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.920
And the place he’s most comfortable is literally 
his closet. And by the end of the show,  

556
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:43.760
he’s a lone man on a raft rowing to save his crew 
of queer misfits. His fount family, if you will.

557
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.840
The people who have grown to accept him 
for what he really is, and not what they  

558
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.520
expected him to be. We need more of that 
in this community. Less gate keeping. Less  

559
00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.600
dictatorial instructions on who is and who 
isn’t being queer the right way. We’re all  

560
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.400
on the same boat, and we sink or sail 
together. And I think it’s better if we sail.

561
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:19.840
Under as many flags as we damn well please.
