yeah not not like going to parties or

48
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.519
anything but like driving from one place
to another place I I am trying to set

49
00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.000
myself a self up in a way where I can
start doing that

50
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.260
yeah you're what'd you call it the other
day your horror phase face era

51
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.260
 era error the era which
like I don't think I want to do a lot of

52
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.640
the actual literal sledding but I would
like to figurative slept I know like I'm

53

going on prep for no other reason than
just in case

54
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.519
honestly I want to do that too because
like I just you know

55
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.799
not even to like have you know sex
without a condom but just like you know

56
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.019
I am someone who frequently bites holes
into their cheek like

57
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.280
not have that going on and as someone
with anxiety disorder like when I talk

58
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.060
to the nurse practitioner having anxiety
was like yep that you're you're good for

59
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.720
prep yeah

60
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.080
yeah thoughts on glamor as some people
think it's bad but it's good it is good

61
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.040
glamorous is fantastic it's another one
of those shows with an almost entirely

62
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.759
queer cast lots of queer characters uh
just so fun it's like Ugly Betty if

63
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.479
everybody was gay
I do have a severe amount of body

64
00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.560
dysmorphia that's going on because all
of the guys have amazing bodies and it's

65
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.060
kind of messing with my head and so I
bought an exercise bike last night it'll

66
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.000
be delivered tomorrow because
um

67
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.860
uh body dysmorphia is bad for my credit
card uh but yeah it's a fantastic show I

68
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.680
haven't finished watching the season yet
there's an entire industry built off of

69
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.380
that this is true but I have three
episodes left to go

70
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.820
um
and all I can say is I forget his name

71
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.300
is it Ben he's the nerdy guy that Marco
keeps kind of flaking on yeah and uh Ben

72
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.060
deserves better and Ben deserves me I
would be a great boyfriend for Ben and I

73
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.139
would smile at him wearing his Star Trek
ensigns uniform

74
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.919
uh instead of like looking at him weird
so

75
00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.350
who does that seriously Big Bang Theory
came out like 20 years ago

76
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.950
[Laughter]

77
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.880
the only thing I saw from glamorous was
Zayn Ethan

78
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.699
gifts I can never remember who Zane
Ethan is is he the jacked Blonde one or

79
00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.520
is that I don't know
would that Femme character

80
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.100

around making of across the spider verse

83
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.400
I have who was the controversy
um crunch basically

84
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.300
um and they've said that they're
delaying the sequel so that it can that

85
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.060
won't happen so controversy averted or
at least dealt with it's nice that they

86
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.699
dealt with it instead of just being like
Target

87
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.139

141
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.160
sake so like for any gay person watching
that they're like yes I have experienced

142
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.660
that I have had so many straight women
say I'm in love with him like older like

143
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.000
sugar older women like in in a very very
clear like this child literally means

144
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.740
everything this child is adorable yeah
it's a common thing for straight women

145
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.380
older straight women to kind of latch
onto that especially when you are at a

146
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.680
younger age like older teenage women is
going to be like that is the most

147
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.300
fabulous child in the world but yeah

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.140
bad about that

um okay here's about it seems like it's

156
00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:04.920
still kind of in the tutorial section
how do you spell Kravitz I'm trying to

157
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.600
figure out what a character looks like
characters

158
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.480
hey Nick just wanted to say that I
finished gentlemen's club I really

159
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.360
enjoyed it I really appreciated the
trans mask rep

160
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.019
s
you're so grateful they were originally

161
00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:25.620
worn by Croatian mercenaries and became
popular in Europe in the 17th century

162
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.899
how did we get on that through several
different lines of conversation we're

163
00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:34.880
always in several different lines of
conversation

164
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.399
and I am expected to keep up with all of
you

165
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:43.200
it is an unambiguously gay content uh
yes it is unambiguously gay content

166
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.459
basically everybody wants to
everybody in in Final Fantasy 16 yes

167
00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:52.740
okay I can get on board for that
I thought because you could have been

168
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.320
talking about glamorous you could have
also been talking about my book and the

169
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.500
same content the same rule applies to
all of these things I might have this

170
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.839
 camera with its with its zooming
and it's not zooming and it's not doing

171
00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:07.920
as I tell it
are the glasses blue or is it just the

172
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.660
light Reflections
in the middle though

173
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:17.639
yeah they are
is there a way to read it in Europe

174
00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:23.300
um the book yes there is any M you can
buy it at any Amazon and other places

175
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.920
most book reads you can get it from most
major book resellers as well as you can

176
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.519
order it through virtually any bookstore
there's actually a link in the

177
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:36.060
description you can go there and it will
probably take you to the right Amazon

178
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.320
page I believe
I believe

179
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.760
um I'm actually I would like to get into
Final Fantasy the new one specifically

180
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.060
because I want to support a game a game
that's actually developing queer

181
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.060
characters like we've been clamoring for
that so it's good to represent that if

182
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.959
it's how if it's true I don't know if
the main character is queer from what

183
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.139
I've heard the main characters kind of
sex neutral

184
00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:02.220
they're kind of they don't really have a
love interest from what I've heard I

185
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.660
love his dog but like virtually everyone
around him is horny

186
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.019
um I haven't gone to any of the horny
people yet I'm like I said I'm pretty

187
00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:14.040
sure I'm still in the tutorial phase
well Raphael why would um

188
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.560
why why specifically even publisher

189
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:25.639
don't touch Amazon doesn't have it yet
James got a new

190
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.980
oh I think
um

191
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.920
amazon.de is one of the ones that has a
weird tax thing and so we couldn't get

192
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.560
it there one of them no um there were
three a German friend did Judge dot e e

193
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.120
d e is a German one
okay uh the German one I know it can

194
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.560
sell in Germany because we've uh

195
00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:53.579
uh through my own label
um

196
00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:58.620
I'm fancy like that uh not really but uh
you should be able to get it in Brazil

197
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.120
through Amazon
yeah you can get it everywhere except

198
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.660
through Amazon everywhere except I think
Japan

199
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:12.360
uh and two other places there's three
countries that we couldn't do it through

200
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:20.899
because
of stupid uh tax tariff nonsense stuff

201
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.560
excuse me oh I'm talking about
translations yeah that's something I've

202
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.339
had a few people offer to kind of
translate specifically into Spanish and

203
00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:33.000
I would really like that but I also do
not know the logistics behind that like

204
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.699
how much I would fairly need to pay
people right what that means

205
00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:43.940
um so that's why I haven't really gone
deep into that

206
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.839
can't really talk more about the gay
caught in Final Fantasy 16 without

207
00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:52.800
spoilers Okay so
there is impact game content in Final

208
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.579
Fantasy 16 though it was like me asking
like is there gay content in succession

209
00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:02.940
people are like well I'm like just do
guys well no okay thank you yes or

210
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.420
no please like but they're they're
basically a bunch of drag queens I'm

211
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.440
like all right well I'll check it out
then and they were all a bunch of drag

212
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.820
queens you watched the session it's so
good you told me how it ended that makes

213
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:21.720
me want to watch it more you're so good
it is oh it's fantastic I don't think

214
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.100
Luca would be speaking Portuguese right
now this is a tangent uh Lucas speaks

215
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.800
like two dozen languages
um

216
00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:36.899
and Taylor it translation or a
translation is super complicated because

217
00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:40.740
it's not just about translating the
words because you have to localize it

218
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.199
um and that's why it's definitely done
through publishing houses and why it's a

219
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:46.680
big deal when a book gets translated
because it means it's been localized for

220
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.180
to match not only the kind of culture
that's existing but the the same kind of

221
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:57.240
linguistic tone yeah
where's my button there it is

222
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.060
um clearly beloved on succession I was
very much team shiv uh and shiv kinda

223
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.980
won in the end
um because of Tom

224
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.640
so I won

225
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.620
James have you seen the new season of
The Witcher yet no I haven't even

226
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.459
finished why I haven't watched season
two I lost interest in it

227
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:23.880
um
yeah it won't be won't be watching it

228
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.040
yes team shift yes she should have been
she she's as close to CEO as any of them

229
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.179
and you know she's One Heartbeat Away
from becoming CEO basically she just has

230
00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:37.380
to have one dead husband yeah she just
needs one dead husband although I feel

231
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.760
like her husband needs to start
uh oh oh God damn it I forget his name

232
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.559
but you you know who I'm talking about

233
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:52.880
um cousin Greg cousin Greg James the new
actor for James T Kirk supports spark

234
00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:00.240
spark Kirk and Spock they cast another
Captain Kirk Jesus Christ again Star

235
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.820
Trek and Chris Pratt uh Chris Park Chris
Pine was fine in that role

236
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.539
um I think about Chris Pine is that I
don't think like uh I say about Jamie

237
00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:12.960
Lee Curtis he's not a leading man he's
he's a better supporting actor than he

238
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.780
is a leading actor
yeah

239
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.340
um and I wish that the stigma would be
removed from that because you can be

240
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.200
sometimes being a great supporting actor
is better than being an okay leading

241
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.500
actor hmm
isn't the guy who plays the patriarch on

242
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:34.440
succession anti-queer conservative or
something maybe I can't say for sure I

243
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.600
don't know the dude I know that he
played a pedophile in a movie with

244
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.179
um Pop
um The Riddler

245
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.179
oh that movie made me feel so greasy um

246
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.100
I had a huge crush on Paul Dano yeah
like I just yeah I have a question about

247
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.640
patreon goals it's the supernatural
video you mentioned in the announcement

248
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.960
video is still happening someday it will
um

249
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.480
someday well it's uh it's one of these
floating goals that we have

250
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.799
um there's a couple of floating goals
that will happen at some point I'm just

251
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:20.460
not sure when because we have some
locked in goals that we have to do we

252
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.940
have to do the Sandman video we have to
do the Revolutionary girl Lieutenant

253
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:29.039
video we've got some Patron requests
such as uh camp camp and

254
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:34.020
disco Elysium
for disleasing for playing it we could

255
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.039
play it in a let's play yeah I wanted to
do that yeah

256
00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:43.140
um and wait what's the other
um uh oh uh Evangelion we have an

257
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.100
Evangelion video that we have to we have
a lot to do well the supernatural video

258
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.280
and that those those videos are aside
from the normal YouTube videos we're

259
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.460
doing

260
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.380
what would the supernatural honestly we
could include Supernatural in the

261
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.980
discussion about head Canon
head Cannon we could yes all right

262
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.700
Supernatural video coming in the fall
here we go confirmed you can hold us to

263
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.000
that
by the way there won't be a whole lot

264
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.720
about supernatural because there's not a
whole lot too Supernatural but oh God

265
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.100
what's the Disco Elysium controversy I
think it's about the sequel the develop

266
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.360
the lead writer or developer from the
first one was not brought back on for

267
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.640
the second one in fact I think it was
kicked off

268
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.679
a very Wonder Woman 1984 of them had did
they not learn did they not see what

269
00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:39.840
happens when you abandon the writer
uh that seems to be a trend these days

270
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.539
James you get some male queer content in
this season of The Witcher does it

271
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:50.460
involve Henry Cavill or the dude that
replaced him yeah it's true no he hasn't

272
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.760
been replaced yet oh really I thought
that he was I thought that was no it's

273
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.900
next season oh okay

274
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.299
I haven't watched pneumonia yet uh I
think Ramona just came out today I do

275
00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:03.799
plan on watching it though it looks
really fun

276
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.100
it might get added to our magical
lesbian

277
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.780
video you ask here
is confirmed by in season three oh good

278
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.760
for him good for yes here I uh I've been
doing that lately every time I find out

279
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:24.240
like an actor is gay like the guy on
um uh the show that I was talking about

280
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.380
what was it what was it fabulous
gorgeous

281
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.440
glamorous glamorous
um

282
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.059
the guy on glamorous who plays like the
gym bunny gay I was like oh he's

283
00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:38.880
definitely straight and then I Googled
him and he's not he's actually gay and I

284
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.419
was like oh goodness we had this that's
like my response now we also kind of had

285
00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:45.480
this discussion in the car a little bit
too about how

286
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.620
um like I I mentioned the idea of
synchronity within queer acting or

287
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.480
within gay roles and gay actors
because the the discussion that caught

288
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.200
frequently comes up on the stream
specifically is can a Street character

289
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.700
play a gay character yeah and my
response to that is it's very

290
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.820
conditional
um there's a way I think there's it's

291
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.240
okay to get grandfathered in if you're
like Stanley chuchi or are we talking

292
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.500
about Martin Sheen yeah um if you played
gay characters essentially before it was

293
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.799
cool
um and you kind of you know wanted these

294
00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:20.520
roles and went after these roles at a
point when uh queer people were still

295
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.659
being persecuted that's that I see that
as a way of raising awareness and

296
00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:28.559
normalizing these identities uh but
there's also a point now where that

297
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:33.059
can't take over because that can't take
over because um then you just have

298
00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:36.720
straight characters playing gay
characters to win Awards yeah while gay

299
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.100
actors have to stay in the closet so and
we talked about if you there's an

300
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.980
alternate where you come up as a gay
actor at which point there's a glass

301
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.299
ceiling and that's the Murphy verse
um you basically get to be in a Ryan

302
00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:52.200
Murphy we're gonna fix that with Telos
because we are absolutely going to lap

303
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.919
Ryan Murphy yeah
it's gonna happen so

304
00:22:55.919 --> 00:23:00.780
um I I feel like at the point when gay
actors are allowed to be openly gay

305
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.740
without having the career tanked
um and having the same opportunities as

306
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.360
straight actors I I think at that point
we can start having straight people play

307
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.980
gay characters and not be fine take away
TD and Rhys Darby have accents they get

308
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.059
a pass
why what did they do

309
00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:22.440
our flag means death right right right
yeah and yeah a gym bunny is someone who

310
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.080
goes to the gym all the time in this
character

311
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.940
um is literally always going or coming
from the gym

312
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.240
which I think is kind of the show it's
very camp and I think it's very much a

313
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.760
commentary on those types of people like
there he's literally only ever seen at

314
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.500
or leaving or going to the gym

315
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.919
I think it's okay uh but really I think
that when we're talking about gay

316
00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:53.820
stories and like gay movies and whatever
I I think it's more important to have

317
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.320
queer people behind the camera and in
development yeah I don't care who's like

318
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.940
my the way I look at it trans characters
should only be played by trans actors or

319
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.080
actresses but as far as gay characters
by character straight characters I don't

320
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.520
give a as long as the writer and
director are gay or you know lesbian by

321
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.240
whatever whatever
or if there's a queer producer like

322
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.000
someone I know the writer or the
director there needs to be someone who's

323
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.840
like some someone with their hand on the
wheel who can turn steer their ship in

324
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.620
terms of the right gay directions it's a
really good documentary oh The Rock

325
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.620
Hudson documentary is out I haven't seen
I haven't seen it yet but I knew it was

326
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.720
coming out because again
um pride month so of course at the end

327
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.260
of the loop when are we going to see
content from Telos again this fall we

328
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.440
finally come to the final conclusions
about stuff which sounds really dour

329
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.900
finally conclusions but um yeah we're
gonna there's gonna be some stuff the

330
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:52.380
plan is that the backers will get at
least an initial edit by Christmas as

331
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:59.039
sort of a Christmas gift and um
it might be uh next year before anyone

332
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.820
else sees it and we're gonna see like
does it go are we gonna put it on

333
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.059
YouTube like as a rental thing are we
going to send it out to film festivals

334
00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:09.299
what's gonna happen but yeah uh by the
end of the year there's going to be a

335
00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:15.600
feature length queer inclusive lead
movie from Telos and

336
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.740
um I hope you like psychological
thrillers

337
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.980
I don't worry about not being able to
get through the book it's you know

338
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.760
notebook is for every one person I got a
lot of feedback there just doesn't click

339
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.539
with a lot of people and I'm fine with
that I think it clicks with the kind

340
00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:34.620
with enough people that I'm comfortable
with so it's I I love that you tried

341
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.100
thank you very much but you know you
don't have to feel bad about it

342
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.320
because the new Superman has kissed boys
but he is straight but he has played

343
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.640
lots of gay and bisexual characters
um or in the words The Immortal words of

344
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.640
Tom Hardy I'm a Hollywood actor of
course I've slept with men yeah

345
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.460
and it's like oh they found the straight
version of Henry Cavill good for you

346
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.120
okay that's just a garbage can I'd love
to see Productions say we commit to 20

347
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.779
queer cast and crew no names but that
amount of people you know what maybe

348
00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:07.140
that's what Tello should do uh I would I
would go higher than that though for

349
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:13.140
Telos I would say 50 just like cross the
board 50 of the Caster crew are gay or

350
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.200
queer and we're not going to tell you
who because we don't find a place for my

351
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.760
stickers oh it's more extra stickers
yeah where they're hiding yeah no one

352
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.220
can see them and know you're a slot
except for airport security when they

353
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.940
take my laptop

354
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.960
well then they can take you away for a
cavity circuit so you really want to get

355
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.640
into it
the new uh Superman is David Koren sweat

356
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.240
who looks exactly like you would think
Superman looks I need to check this out

357
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.260
except he is
um skinnier than what a lot of people

358
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.700
think Superman looks like and he would
make a fantastic Superman next to uh

359
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.760
battenson Robert Pattinson's Batman but
because Warner Brothers

360
00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.960
Henry Cavill and
um Robert Stark

361
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.919
he is he is Richard Madden yeah Richard
Madden

362
00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:09.659
and also that other guy that I mentioned
Oppenheimer actor Killian Murphy Killian

363
00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:13.380
Murphy's waist grow on here look at his
eyes look at his eyes oh yeah the eyes I

364
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.140
see it
he's in parole too so like just a

365
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.640
combination of three British he was also
in uh Hollywood he was really good in

366
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.720
Hollywood I really liked him in
Hollywood I I so many people Hollywood

367
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.900
was another thing that was almost
entirely gay and people were like this

368
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:33.299
is a terrible show I'm like you shut up
stop stop lambasting everything that's

369
00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:37.740
queer straight people routinely give bad
reviews to query things where it's not

370
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.360
all about queer suffering and pathos
like I'm over it we can't trust people

371
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.559
unless it's Bros

372
00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:51.840
that wasn't queer people suffering that
was queer people inflicting suffering

373
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.200
it was queer people suffering because I
was suffering when I was

374
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.640
watching it
it's so weird that that movie got like

375
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:05.159
glowing reviews from like critics
everywhere and like every gay person was

376
00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:09.600
like this is Washington was completely
just over it like

377
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.440
Killian Murphy looks like
he's Irish

378
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.580
can you give examples I need more stuff
to add to my watch list eggs

379
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.940
um examples of what Rosie Scottish I
don't know

380
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.600
I think Hollywood needs
Hollywood needs to be oh the show

381
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.320
Hollywood I was hoping for I was really
hoping for a second season but of course

382
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.700
it got canceled because it's gay skinny
guy guys are so hot We Stand Morpheus

383
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.200
from the Sandman so some angles of
Morpheus from the Sandman I'm like he is

384
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.860
gorgeous okay and then some angles I'm
like I'll tell you why they did that um

385
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.340
they did that absolutely on purpose and
exasperated with the lighting because

386
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.260
dream is dualistic he is you know
benevolent at the same time as he is you

387
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.820
know a tyrannical uh because he's he's
you know you're the best the best dreams

388
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.320
of your life versus the most terrifying
nightmares so they wanted to go with an

389
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.320
actor whose face could project both
and be both like sort of like there are

390
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.320
some angles that are completely just
inhumanly hideous and others where he's

391
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.740
like the most gorgeous person on the
planet oh Cora if Sandman had been

392
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.779
animated I would have finished watching
it

393
00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:15.900
I feel so bad that you didn't like it
it's not that I didn't like it I did

394
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.740
like it it's just that halfway through
the season it was like and it's over oh

395
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.940
no there's five more episodes left and I
was and I didn't feel then and I knew so

396
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.020
many people had told me oh those second
like that second group is so sad I was

397
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:33.419
like I just want to get sad it's not sad
though I I I would combat that there it

398
00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:37.080
it is that they've made them cry and
stuff I cry enough

399
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.240
it's it's so incredibly first of all the
second half has a better Arc to it it's

400
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.480
the second Arc of the Sandman Series so
it it has a more through line plot to it

401
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.020
and I think that it holds better than
the uh comic comic books the second

402
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.179
second half of it but um so like I would
give the second half onward a try you

403
00:29:57.179 --> 00:30:01.940
don't even need the first half just
it you don't need it

404
00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:07.320
can't watch slow shows see I'm fine I
can watch

405
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.980
excuse me I can watch any kind of show
um like with Sandman it wasn't that I

406
00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.779
found it slow or boring or anything like
that it was that it's it came to an end

407
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:20.580
like the plot ended halfway through and
it actually did because that's the first

408
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:26.039
volume of the comics
um and so the plot ended but there was

409
00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:31.440
more and I was like oh I'm not ready to
jump into the next bit of it but I am

410
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.320
gonna I'm gonna finish watching it
because we do have a Sandman video well

411
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.700
Sandman inclusive video coming for
patrons this summer oh yeah because like

412
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.200
that deals with Sandman and good Omens
yeah I I definitely think that it was

413
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.580
this it was Miss it should have been two
different seasons honestly it should

414
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.820
have been like two mini Seasons yeah
like what they did with with stranger

415
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.279
things they should have released them
like a month apart or something like

416
00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:57.200
that it would have kept it in the
conversation longer

417
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.740
frankly Sandman was a breath of fresh
air after tiring myself out for so many

418
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.360
fast-paced Marvel shows yes oh I don't
watch Marvel anymore

419
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.240
like watching Sandman where the
characters just got to have

420
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.520
conversations for like an entire episode

421
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.100
TV shows don't do that anymore it's like
the whole episode of Breaking Bad where

422
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.240
they're just trying to swat a fly and
it's considered the best episode of the

423
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.600
whole series and has nothing to do with
anything else

424
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.059
I even found that Arcane went a little
bit fast

425
00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:37.320
um yeah I would have liked okay
characters that I specifically didn't

426
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.500
like because they didn't get developed
enough and their development had to

427
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.020
basically been solved with ah it's fine
synchronity I'm not going to talk about

428
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.580
it loved your loved the new video need
to see angels in America hated rent

429
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.419
although you're finished now the work
begins was kind of ominous oh that's

430
00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:57.779
that's actually the last line of Angels
in America yeah it's not ominous it's

431
00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:02.520
it's hopeful it's it's hopeful because
well some work needs to begin because

432
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.179
the Supreme Court just shipped the bed
and France is on fire

433
00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:09.600
um and we need to be more like France we
need to be more like friends I'm just

434
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:17.340
saying James new name for your list new
name for my list your lust my lust Your

435
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.980
Lust Shabu marut
let's see what does shaboot my root look

436
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.100
like

437
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:35.159
I don't a lot of people are kind of he
kind of looks like Brandon Rogers a

438
00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:37.980
little bit yeah a lot of people are
trying to like sort of say like oh

439
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.860
what's the reason for this like short
attention spans or the acceleration of

440
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.679
media like you mentioned like a lot of
people are willing to want to throw

441
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:47.460
blame on one thing or another thing I
think it's just a conflation of reasons

442
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.960
that are kind of
um exasperating

443
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.500
exasperating in this kind of you know
Perfect Storm of crap media that's

444
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.279
coming out money because the reason why
like we can blame Tech talk and say tick

445
00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:03.659
tock is the reason why people talk at
all I play money but like it's cheaper

446
00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:08.100
to produce a shorter season not just
that but like okay if Tick Tock is the

447
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.360
reason for why is there the sole reason
for why media is becoming shorter for

448
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.940
why people left for an attention spans
what out Vine

449
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.980
was a decade Divine was a huge deal and
it had even greater time constraints

450
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.299
than Tick Tock did
um I I think it's the reason why Tick

451
00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:28.880
Tock is successful I I think it's a
symptom not a Cause

452
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.559
yeah like shows started to get shorter
they went from like 22 to 28 episode

453
00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:39.000
Seasons down to like 13 episode Seasons
that happened in the early 2000s but

454
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.720
that also happened when shows were
putting much more content into those 13

455
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.620
episodes they're like okay let's take
well there was no more like Filler

456
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.980
episodes but like that happened in the
early 2000s and people were complaining

457
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.880
that they weren't getting as much uh 26
in the city I think was an example of

458
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.760
that
um No Sex in the City was pretty much

459
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.919
consistently 18 episodes except for
season five because uh she got pregnant

460
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:07.140
um but The Sopranos was like I think 13
episodes every season

461
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:12.659
um and uh it was just that's the way it
went queers folk started out as 20

462
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:17.399
episode 22 Episodes and then eventually
ended up at 12 episodes uh by the end

463
00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:20.099
because that's just what TV shows were
doing

464
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:25.200
um and it's because it's much cheaper to
produce a shorter season it's cheaper to

465
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:32.280
produce multiple short shows than
a cup that hopefully one of them Hits

466
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:37.440
Huge than producing a couple of giant
shows and then if none of them hit huge

467
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.200
you're just dead you're screwed well
yeah it's hedging your bats but also

468
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.639
like I think that playing with that
format and using those 13 episodes to

469
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.780
just make that content much better and
put more work and Care into that whereas

470
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.859
I find when it comes to like 26 episode
Seasons they drag on for a long a while

471
00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:56.700
uh Theo as the first season of Sex in
the City had 12 episodes

472
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:02.520
uh there was two uh season one had 12
then 18 18.

473
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.200
8 20.

474
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.079
I am king of Sex in the City trivia it's
true

475
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:17.339
um season six episode two

start having sex and it sucks and

485
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.700
they're having sex and they can hear the
dumpster the dump truck outside but like

486
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.240
picking up the garbage leaving with the
garbage

487
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.680

they're they're on the they're on the
track again

492
00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:39.839
done a lot of shows have a short first
season and then longer ones if they did

493
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:45.300
well uh they usually sitcoms usually
started with like big Seasons but uh

494
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.520
some shows
um

495
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:54.480
did kind of Follow that that uh
kind of give me the chocolate chocolate

496
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.980
give me chocolate thank you
do kids nowadays only care about special

497
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.420
effects and sensory spectacle I don't
think so no I don't think they do I

498
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.020
don't think so they're they're getting
just as Fed Up of sensory spectacle as

499
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.020
everyone else yeah if you want to know
who the sensory spectacle is geared

500
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.900
towards it's honestly middle-aged
millennials

501
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.800
uh people who are kind of transferred I
don't care gets slapped around by the

502
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.960
Russian I didn't forget that she gets I
know exactly the kind that appeals to

503
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.140
and they're the kinds that will look at
me and said have you seen the new Black

504
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.320
Panther movie I'm like yeah
um he's like should I watch it I'm like

505
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.720
honestly there's nothing really that
special there except for some

506
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.140
performances like you know it's not as
good as the first one and it'll be like

507
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.380
yeah but should I see it and I'm like I
literally just answered that but yeah

508
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.859
should I see it and it's like you get to
the point where it's like is there

509
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.680
anything in this movie that'll play out
in later Marvel movies that I should see

510
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.640
now in this movie so I know what's going
on I'm like yes absolutely yeah that's

511
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.140
that's what it's doing so it's people
who just want that kind of the turn your

512
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.560
brain off
without turning your brain off uh they

513
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.920
want to think that they're thinking uh
no we haven't watched any more of camp

514
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.859
Camp yet it's been we're very been very
very busy moved twice yeah last month

515
00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:11.820
yeah it's been a busy busy busy time
um but now we've got the summer and so

516
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:18.119
stuff will actually
will uh get to to relaxing things I'm

517
00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:22.619
gonna tell you something controversial
I actually like Curry Bradshaw

518
00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:28.020
I mean I would be friends with Carrie I
wouldn't date her no like if I

519
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.859
was a straight man I would not go within
10 feet of her and the reasons that I

520
00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:34.500
like Carrie Bradshaw are because of
subtext

521
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.359
um she will and I think she in her
because the show's framing devices she's

522
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:43.700
narrating her life yeah I think that she
has

523
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.940
mental health problems
and she she has narcissistic

524
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.660
personalities no she paints such a
Negative depiction of herself

525
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.740
that's what I mean like I think she over
ruminates on her narcissism and thinks

526
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.400
that makes her a terrible person yeah so
I think she frames herself as being Much

527
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.820
More Much More negative than I think she
actually is yeah whereas when she's

528
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:08.220
talking about any one of her friends
it's nothing but glowing uh devotions uh

529
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.780
she loves these people so much and is
willing to and is only willing to depict

530
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:18.119
the the most positive side of them
uh Raphael I did read the first uh book

531
00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:26.099
of The Carrie Diaries but it was so
incredibly baby's first y a that I

532
00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:30.540
um gave up on it my mom my mom read them
all though and they're not like Canon

533
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.260
for Carrie's history at all which is why
one of the reasons I stopped reading

534
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:41.119
because they interfered with what she
had said on the show about her youth

535
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.420
Marvel at least has tried to keep their
movies tied together dude you know what

536
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.339
honestly I prefer how you know I would
prefer Superman and and Batman have

537
00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:53.579
nothing to do with each other
than the mess that's going on with

538
00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:57.780
marble right now yeah
James when will the vampire genre come

539
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.020
out of the coffin again when I bring it
out

540
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.099
I don't think it's I don't think

541
00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:07.740
it's the gayest
gayest television we've also got our

542
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:13.380
vampire idea plant vampire idea
I'm gonna strike that as a short story

543
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:18.440
as a novella though before we go ahead
with that

544
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.099
okay wait I said read I meant watch oh
uh no I didn't watch any of the show

545
00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:30.540
they were based on uh they were CW shows
which immediately just no

546
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:36.000
um but they were um based on the I think
a Trilogy of books came out that Candace

547
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.240
Bushnell wrote because
uh why a pays well

548
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.680
especially when you're writing for girls

549
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.140
yeah what we do in the shadows is also
like super gay I feel like vampires are

550
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.980
just getting gayer
has anyone seen the new trailer for the

551
00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.720
season four five season five of what we
do in the shadows

552
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.800
I'm looking so much forward to it
because season I I didn't dislike season

553
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.920
four but I also felt like it was a bit
of a downer

554
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.780
okay we're just gonna be sad everyone
was kind of like really depressed but

555
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:18.260
like season five looks like it's going
crazy again

556
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.619
you should adapt the Sarah J Maas books
um we don't have the money for that all

557
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:29.460
right let me what are they they're um
like fantasy books

558
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.920
um I I I I I can't I don't think I've
read any of them actually uh but I know

559
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.480
it would be expensive as hell to make
them

560
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.680
if you ever find it hard to invest in
lgbtq Plus shows because of that feeling

561
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.619
in the back of your head that it's going
to end up being

562
00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:53.460
brigaded and will most likely be
canceled or dropped

563
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.579
um

564
00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:58.220
um

565
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:06.119
no I I a lot of shows on Netflix I will
avoid uh whether they're straight or gay

566
00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:11.940
because Netflix has a horrible habit of
canceling things prematurely

567
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.960
um although they are apparently changing
that now they're giving shows longer to

568
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.320
kind of like find their legs before they
cancel or not

569
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.440
um
the thing that frustrates me about

570
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:29.940
watching gay shows is is when the gay is
ourselves start fighting over whether

571
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.960
it's good representation or not because
it has a femme character or it has too

572
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.820
many trans characters or it has you know
a a

573
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.640
whatever and that that just irritates
the hell out of me because gays are so

574
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.079
annoying it's like complaining about um
the bird cage and saying that bird cage

575
00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:53.640
is horribly offensive because Nathan
lays plays an incredibly harmful

576
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.060
stereotype of an effeminate man because
you

577
00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.500
and it's like Nathan Lane the one gay
actor on that show on that movie yeah

578
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.920
plays the feminate character who's
actually the got the balls of steel

579
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.640
there like he's the one who shows up at
the end and kind of saves the day yeah

580
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.480
somewhat

581
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.180
and yes I have been sleeping not been
sleeping well lately I think it's been

582
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.599
allergies I've started to take my
Claritin again

583
00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:22.859
oh is Netflix actually bringing back
sense8 holy

584
00:43:22.859 --> 00:43:26.880
no no they said Netflix bring back
sense8 now oh okay

585
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.020
minor communities
fight over representation when the

586
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.040
options are limited and everyone wants
their fair share of every single piece

587
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.339
of media which is something I can say
for

588
00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:43.440
um glamorous is that pretty much
everyone's included I don't think

589
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.740
there's a trans character but there is
non-binary character there's gay

590
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.000
characters there's lesbian characters
there's bisexual characters there's fem

591
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.560
gaze there's Mass gaze there's everybody
almost everybody across the rainbow I'm

592
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.380
waiting for an actual trans character to
show up

593
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.780
um
maybe in season two because apparently

594
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.440
the show is doing well and there will
likely be a season two fingers crossed I

595
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.040
won a season two someone awesome I have
in fact played Spirit fair and I feel

596
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.960
like the only person on the planet that
didn't like it

597
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.500
sense8 was also pretty I tried watching
sense8 and I couldn't get past the first

598
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.980
episode I thought it was so boring yeah
I'm sorry I know lots of people love it

599
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.720
I thought it was so boring I was
watching it for Daryl Hannah but Daryl

600
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.599
Hannah was Dale Hannah and Sensei yeah
oh

601
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.180
Warrior none did get saved though yeah I
did see that that got renewed

602
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.540
I uh I specifically have learned to kind
of avoid queer animation it seems to be

603
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.720
canceled more often than live action
queer stuff

604
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.140
um especially if it's done with if it
has anything to do with Disney don't

605
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.980
even bother

606
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.520
which I don't understand why so many
queer creators will flock to Disney for

607
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.079
like maybe they just get turned down by
Nickelodeon like but then again like we

608
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:01.740
talked about you can produce this stuff
online and turn great numbers yeah hell

609
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:07.319
of a boss is a thing uh and has been
hotel is a thing and they are hugely

610
00:45:07.319 --> 00:45:14.640
successful and uh no well with with
um has been Hotel there is a studio

611
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:21.660
behind it yeah the a24 yeah but like the
animation quality in hell of a boss in

612
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.280
terms of just how choppy it is wasn't
that much worse than Owl House season

613
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.579
one

614
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.839
sorry what the smoothness of animation
and hell of a boss wasn't that much

615
00:45:33.839 --> 00:45:39.020
rougher than the first season of all
house like no not at all

616
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.619
how expensive to produce movies that
depends on the movie

617
00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:46.260
yeah
um we're gonna be producing movies in

618
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:52.680
the 20 000 range which is considered the
it's literally the cash on hand in case

619
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.099
somebody needs Gatorade on any given day
on an actual movie Set it's far below

620
00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:04.500
the average craft food budget per day
like our budget for the whole movie is a

621
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:10.200
day's food Budget on a on a big on a
typical Hollywood movie not even a big

622
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.660
one typical
um I haven't even watched the third

623
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.740
season of Al house
I watched the first episode and then I

624
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.300
found out that they confirmed Hunter as
straight and I gave up

625
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:27.000
um but uh but some movies like you can
do movies at a super low budget now

626
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.720
because you don't need to pay for film
stock you can do movies in the 10 to 25

627
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.740
000 range and they can actually be
really really well made

628
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.119
um and then there's movies that are 300
million dollars and I want to like shank

629
00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:43.339
the producers and just say like what
what what what

630
00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:47.579
conceptualize you because here's here's
a little bit of movie math okay a movie

631
00:46:47.579 --> 00:46:53.460
makes needs to make twice as much money
as it costs okay a movie a movie needs

632
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.500
to make twice as much money as it costs
to produce to make a budget because half

633
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.760
of the money goes to the theaters in
which it is screened so if a movie costs

634
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.240
200 million dollars to make it needs to
make 400 million before it can break

635
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.700
even but advertising movies that are
that big usually have a hundred million

636
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.020
dollars in advertising so if a movie
costs 200 million dollars to make it

637
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.180
costs it actually needs to make 600
million dollars back to start turning a

638
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:26.400
profit
some movies released recently have cost

639
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.300
300 million dollars to make plus a
hundred million dollars in advertising

640
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.980
which means they need to make 800
million dollars before they can even

641
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.420
come close to profitability which
basically means they need to be billion

642
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.839
dollar movies before they can be
successes this is the new Indiana Jones

643
00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:48.079
movie
uh this is the uh The Flash and I'm like

644
00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:55.200
this is fiscal just irresponsibility it
is ridiculous it is stupid it is so bad

645
00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.300
I'm just like Hollywood this was this
happened in the 50s and 60s Hollywood

646
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.099
got so big and the bubble burst and then
movies got real small real fast and

647
00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:08.280
that's what's gonna happen again The
Little Mermaid too yes The Little

648
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.180
Mermaid was the same thing

649
00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:15.960
and like all the they they got real used
to these billion dollar movies and the

650
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:21.660
pandemic happened and people stopped
just going to the movies constantly and

651
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.720
yeah
Avatar's a bit of a different situation

652
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.460
because Avatar actually made its money
packs somehow never bet against James

653
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.920
Cameron James Cameron's movies will make
their money back

654
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.980
how about a hundred movies at 8 million
dollars each that's that's kind of the

655
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.819
way that bloom house Works Bloom house
will spend like half a million dollars

656
00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:51.359
on a movie and then release it and
around Halloween make their match back

657
00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:55.260
sometimes they'll spend a million
dollars on a movie and then just shelve

658
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.440
it not do anything with it and then one
of the actors ends up in a big project

659
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.160
suddenly they become a movie star and
they're like huh we have a movie with

660
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.060
that guy and they'll release it and it
works well bloomhouse has been making a

661
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.839
ton of money and if anyone knows anyone
who works at Bloom house I would really

662
00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:13.980
like to work with you I love horror
movies and I would love to make a horror

663
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.020
movie with you
please

664
00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.859
do you think it's better for lgbtq plus
creators to just go Indie and create

665
00:49:24.859 --> 00:49:30.000
lgbtq Plus movies uh that's really the
only way to do it Studios almost never

666
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.319
do queer movies Nick

667
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.440
yeah go for it

668
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.640
something like that that happened with
Mandy Moore in her shark movie getting a

669
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.180
wide release after this is us all right
I forgot about that movie

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:24.660
London I think isn't it

675
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:30.839

00:50:30.839 --> 00:50:35.760
just like
liking his like curly hair

677
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.520

Canada

682
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.140
nobody else is legal in Canada
well it's illegal to fire someone for

683
00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.559
being gay but it's legal to do that in
America again because the Supreme Court

684
00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:17.099
is backwards did they actually strike
that down

685
00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:22.440
indeed they did they did that today
congratulations America they're on a

686
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.099
rampage what is the most beautiful actor
you've seen in person I haven't seen a

687
00:51:26.099 --> 00:51:31.260
whole lot of actors in person uh fun
fact I am within six degrees of Kevin

688
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.880
Spacey
Kevin Spacey no calling Kevin Spacey too

689
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:43.339
but uh Kevin Bacon Kevin Bacon
people want to be in six years

690
00:51:43.619 --> 00:51:48.300
James look at the cast of CR tell us
what you think what is CR I don't know

691
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.380
what CR is
uh James will your Telos movies be in

692
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.819
theaters here's hoping probably not the
first one

693
00:51:56.819 --> 00:52:02.280
um but hopefully eventually the the hope
for the first one the goal is to either

694
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.480
get it into
um

695
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:11.400
uh critical role in CR to get okay uh to
get it into

696
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.440
um film festivals
uh or to put it up for sale on like

697
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.660
iTunes and uh YouTube and stuff like
that for like two bucks

698
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:26.339
I hate being American desperately want
to move elsewhere ashamed to say I'm

699
00:52:26.339 --> 00:52:30.780
from here I'm ashamed to say that I
desperately wanted to move to America

700
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.140
when I was a teenager don't you still
want to move to California California

701
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.579
isn't America
I saw something I'll adjust my camera in

702
00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:42.900
a second and I and I I I want to move to
California because that's where movies

703
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.380
are made that's where Hollywood is
that's where I need to be to be

704
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:50.160
successful properly but you know if I
can make Telos work I don't need to be

705
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.640
there and then I don't have to move to
America so let's make it happen girl

706
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:58.380
term in the Urban Dictionary called
affirican and then I saw that yeah I

707
00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:02.040
shared it with you yeah yeah and it's
the process of which Americans do not

708
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.119
realize how conditioned they are to just
be terrified and he talked about an

709
00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:09.660
instance about how he was in a bar with
his American friend with two American

710
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:13.380
people that they met who were in a um a
hostel

711
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.559
and they situated themselves
specifically so they could view the

712
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:20.819
exits so that their backs were yeah to
the to walls so they could see where

713
00:53:20.819 --> 00:53:24.660
people were coming and leaving
um a car went off like a muffler kind of

714
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:30.720
banged the car backfire backfired and um
they were visibly shaken and everyone

715
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.599
was like yeah this is fine but the
Americans were like oh my God shoot

716
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:37.859
match like public shooting
um so like and he said that throughout

717
00:53:37.859 --> 00:53:41.460
the rest next few years he documented a
few other instances the way this that

718
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:46.619
Americans kind of just conditioned
themselves passively to be afraid

719
00:53:46.619 --> 00:53:49.740
and I kind of have an American friend
who lives in Maryland which by no

720
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:55.520
accounts is that high-risk state but I
sort of brought that Maryland

721
00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:01.040
yeah really yes well then
um

722
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.520
parts of Maryland
well you know Hannibal Lecter lives

723
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.680
there
um

724
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.220
uh and I sort of said like do you feel
like this he's like no not really and

725
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.400
then he thought for a second but I did
go to a pride festival with an escape

726
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.020
plan in mind so yeah like I've never
gone anywhere with an escape plan in

727
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.559
mind I maybe should have because
sometimes I just want to leave well

728
00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:27.000
especially but it's less about it's more
inconvenient than it is like dangerous I

729
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.160
haven't heard about what's been
happening at certain Pride festivals

730
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.160
especially like in Canada over the last
few years I felt like maybe I should go

731
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.800
into this with like okay whatever brawl
starts uh but not like a shooting like

732
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.920
yeah and when we went to Pride last
weekend it was like other than lots of

733
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.920
people being there it was the chillest
thing there was nobody there causing

734
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.520
trouble no

735
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:54.240
um
Nick's never heard of Baltimore yeah

736
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.800
oh
thoughts on the Donald Trump situation

737
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.480
he's going to jail
I am 100 sure he's going to jail just

738
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.160
like I was like really sure he was
probably gonna get uh nominated or he

739
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.280
was probably gonna get the Republican
nomination in 2016 and then if they

740
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.559
nominated Hillary he would lose or he
would win uh pretty 100 sure he going to

741
00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:19.559
jail
he may run for president from jail and

742
00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:23.040
he may be elected president from jail
and pardoned himself but because he's

743
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.960
going to jail that is 100 possible

744
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
because the Supreme Court was waiting
for the last day of pride month that

745
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.900
ruling
well at least they gave us one more

746
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.700
pride month
if the Canada fires weren't going on I'd

747
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:49.079
move there well there's lots of fires in
the U.S too don't throw stones in glass

748
00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:55.020
houses there yeah like California is on
fire more often than it's not

749
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.200
I won't be surprised if he still doesn't
go to jail after all the junkies gotten

750
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.160
away with the thing is he will go to
jail the the only way he won't go to

751
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:10.200
jail is if the judge slash
um jury is worried about riots happening

752
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.359
for him going to jail
because they will

753
00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:18.420
and you can't trust the police to take
care of it because the police are with

754
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:23.880
him so yeah because he spent the last
eight years establishing with his base

755
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:29.220
and it's interest too that the Democrats
are corrupt and specifically out to get

756
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.240
him yeah
I sleep alone in Mountain Lion Country

757
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.079
sometimes I'm more scared of my job at a
fast food restaurant

758
00:56:37.079 --> 00:56:41.579
I wouldn't be afraid of mountain lions
but I I have no fear complex with large

759
00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:47.040
animals because I have kind of I've
talked to people and they're like you

760
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.200
know wolves
are just dogs it's just you know if

761
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.220
they're hungry yeah a dog will bite you
the same it will it's it's like lions

762
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.940
lions and tigers are just cats they act
just like cats the only difference is

763
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:05.099
they're 500 pound cats well lions in the
wild will not attack humans

764
00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:09.839
um if their pride has unless their pride
has a memory of humans harming them yeah

765
00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:14.220
but like what they were explaining was
like a lion or a cat will do a lion or a

766
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:18.780
tiger will do the exact same things that
a house cat does exact same attack

767
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.579
motions all of it exact same the only
difference is they're 600 pounds so

768
00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:28.260
they're just acting like your cat it's
not that they are more dangerous that

769
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.440
they want to kill you more than your cat
does it's just that your cat is less

770
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.160
likely to pull out I remember I saw like
bears are the things that especially

771
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.240
like uh not here because black bears are
you know very passive they run away

772
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.500
grizzly bears too I think no grizzly
bears are not chill uh I thought brown

773
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.319
bears were the freak they were the
terrifying ones I thought they were the

774
00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:50.520
same thing and Canada brown bears are if
you move to Los Angeles there are

775
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.420
mountain lions and coyotes I love
Coyotes I grew up around coyotes

776
00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:59.099
mountain lions um I actually saw one
there was a cougar kind of pushing a

777
00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:02.400
hiker and it was a video a guy a guy was
taking as he was walking backwards kind

778
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.559
of filming this cougar was stalking him
and kind of growling and he was like oh

779
00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:10.680
my God I felt so scared and someone
commented like no you shouldn't have

780
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.920
felt scared that thing was trying to get
you out of its territory yeah if it

781
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:18.140
wanted you dead you would have never
seen it yeah

782
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.440
polar bear yeah polar bears are instant
death sentences that's yes polar bears

783
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.800
are grizzly bears the thing about that
is that grizzly bears don't have a whole

784
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.380
lot of fear because they're
massive

785
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.160
um they will not attack you unless you
get within direct line of sight between

786
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.700
them and their cup
Grizzlies yeah

787
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:40.020
polar bears will you up though yeah
have y'all seen Santa's campaign for

788
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:45.599
president the thing with Rhonda Sanchez

789
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:52.079
got the personality of like a wet tube
and it's just like an overcooked noodle

790
00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:57.059
like nobody likes him like I don't think

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.240
if Republicans keep passing anti-gay
bills in the South they will release a

813
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:15.660
list of Republican lawmakers and
politicians who have partner accounts

814
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:22.319

they don't want to take my job away
who's the PPC uh Progressive

816
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.299
conservatives
there's a new Progressive conservative

817
01:01:30.299 --> 01:01:35.579
party is that what the PPC stands for
I know the conservatives are actively

818
01:01:35.579 --> 01:01:42.240
trying to get Bill c-11 taken down which
is the the thing that the Liberals

819
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.660
passed to try and kill YouTubers careers
People's Party of Canada is a

820
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.319
federal party political party in Canada
I'm really actually disappointed with

821
01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:56.760
the NDP for trying to go ahead with this
 bill yeah it's disgusting

822
01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.839
it's like I can't vote for you now you
literally are trying to take my job away

823
01:02:00.839 --> 01:02:05.040
yeah not even like in a vague way like
you are trying to take my like

824
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.760
especially because like you who are the
people that push for leftist politics

825
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.780
it's influencers most people on the
internet and you're trying to make it

826
01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:18.780
difficult for them to you know be to
make money off of this yeah

827
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:22.619
right Aaron Shock was the gay Republican
senator he was also really hot the gay

828
01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:26.339
Republican senator who after he was
edited as gay left the party in disgrace

829
01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:30.059
and now can be seen circuit partying
around California where he is accepted

830
01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:33.540
by the gays because he has abs pretty
much

831
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.500

834
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.440
I rate Mitt Romney Mormon

835
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.520
it's hard to look more more I was gonna
say it looks an hour it's hard to look

836
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.940
more Mormon than Mitt Romney it's Masala
monkey I completely agree with you but

837
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.720
it's like a crazy world we live in when
we're up against Republican politicians

838
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.500
where we're like can we get another
George Bush Junior do you get another

839
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.540
one can we get another day he started
Wars and stuff but he you know he wasn't

840
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.799
trying to kill brown people hit Romney
saying such sensible things against

841
01:03:19.799 --> 01:03:27.119
Trump like yeah world are we in
yeah uh

842
01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:31.680

like let's tear down Disney because gay

843
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.940

845
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.720
like you know what it's like and she's
like I'm not gonna say much but there's

846
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.780
a lot of instruction involved I'm like
you know for those of us who are bossy

847
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.200
that's great

848
01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:57.559
oh good lord
oh

849
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.380
both of your moms are Jennifer Coolidge

850
01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:08.880
Paris I think I think my mom is is
closer to like

851
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:16.319
I don't know not Jennifer Coolidge my my
I can see your mom is Kathy Bates like

852
01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:20.880
uh depending Kathy Bates doesn't really
have a personality though the many the

853
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:28.160
many shades of captains you got misery
you cut Dolores Claiborne

854
01:04:30.839 --> 01:04:34.440
at this point it feels like Mormon boys
is a documentary

855
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.780
thank you
foreign

856
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.880
sounds like a hoot Nick

857
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.359
she's really she's she's really taking
on board the the the she actually who

858
01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:55.380
lives in the city the movie She there's
a specific Kathy Bates character I think

859
01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.880
it's Kathy Bates and oh rain man I don't
know rain man I don't remember which

860
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.180
movie it was but it's where she's like
this kind of hippie lady and has like

861
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.480
just basically like an ongoing Orgy at
her place where a bunch of people come

862
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.119
over to just oh oh oh Jack Nicholson's
in it yeah oh as good as it gets no it's

863
01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:17.099
not as good as you get uh let me look at

Nicholson's in it
About Schmidt

866
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.540
Maybe
might be about Schmidt

867
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.540
I think so because that seems to be the
only movie that they were in that they

868
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.140
were together in anyway she plays
basically this this mystical hippie lady

869
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:39.180
and that's kind of how my mom envisions
herself very Frankie yeah

870
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.020
his next mom Debbie from Queer as Folk
no that would be my mom my mom would be

it that's it About Schmidt this is the

872
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:52.280
Yeah Yeah with the hot tub scene and
yeah

873
01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:58.319

whale hunting that happened off the

922
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.660
Azores
there's just tiny stocks with tiny spots

923
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.500
on the ocean with these gorgeous black
sand beaches okay so off the coast of

924
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:45.179
Portugal
yeah it's up around the horn of

925
01:09:45.179 --> 01:09:50.060
something and there were a lot of sperm
whale stuff there

926
01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.580
I was like you guys and ran the
 these RS yeah

927
01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:00.540
the Aza Azores or the Azores
um I've only heard it pronounce Azores

928
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:04.800
but that was from a very white woman
okay I'm reading it as a Spanish word

929
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.500
where the as would be at the end yeah
go to Spain it's beautiful there's too

930
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:16.260
many beautiful people in Spain
how do beautiful people in Spain feel

931
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:23.159
about slightly neurotic like mid-tier
attractive Canadian pale boys like and

932
01:10:23.159 --> 01:10:27.060
how do they feel about
um kind of overweight

933
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.179
neurotic pale Canadian

934
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.940
with a Visa

935
01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.260
you want to go shopping apparently

936
01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.580
um my mom's boyfriend uh possibly
ex-boyfriend is from the UK and he says

937
01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.940
that there's no more beautiful place in
the world than Spain

938
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:54.840
he says that's that's a lot too that's
why I can't watch Elise

939
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.440
it's a bunch of beautiful Spanish people
like I think I'll be more able to

940
01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.400
consume this kind of media if I feel
like my life at some point becomes more

941
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.159
interesting
good luck

942
01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:13.320
that was so Sinister
why would you say that to me you know

943
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.820
that I'm horribly insensitive about this
well I assume Canadian money is worth a

944
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.199
lot more in Spain I wonder if Canadian
money is worth a lot more in Spain I

945
01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:25.920
know it's worth more in Greece because
Greece's economy sucks

946
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.260
but to the Spanish Euro I just like wave
around a 20 bill in Greece and be like

947
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.640
uh so right now there's no flow chart
but it says that the euro exchange rate

948
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.760
today uh one Canadian dollar to a euro
is six zero point six nine

949
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.320
it's one to oh Spain uses the Euro yeah
I don't does Greece use the euro I think

950
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.760
Germany made them stop using the Euro
because Greece couldn't do money

951
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.840
huh
I mean I love the German attitude on

952
01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:00.000
forcing Greece to pay their debts I know
right because they were so good at that

953
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.659
in the 30s

954
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.500
Germany always pays their debts

955
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:12.840
for a few days in Madrid
okay so Greece does use the euro oh God

956
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.020
damn it what
well it used to be really cheap because

957
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.580
they had no money
they were like oh a Canadian dollar was

958
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:26.159
like a hundred Greek in dollars greekin
that's not it why do Canadians have such

959
01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:28.860
pretty money and I'm still stuck with
freaking people because Canada is

960
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.880
actually one of the world's leading
producers of uh money physical money in

961
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.340
the world like the Canadian Mint mints
the um uh the uh the currencies of like

962
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.940
hundreds of Nations around the world and
apparently our security systems are the

963
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.260
most advanced in the world I went to
um uh Costco the other day and I found

964
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.440
out that I had
um a refund

965
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.900
because of the Costco card it was like
160 bucks and they were like we tried to

966
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.620
mail it to you but your address is
Halifax and I was like oh sorry so I got

967
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.800
them to change that and then they just
gave it to me in cash oh so I have cash

968
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.719
and I feel really awkward about that I'm
like I have am I buying drugs what do

969
01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:12.179
you do with cash TVs are at Costco I put
um

970
01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:17.460
uh I they gave me four fives so twenty
dollars and fives and I put it all in

971
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:21.000
the little like arm rest of my car in
case I drive by someone who's like

972
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.179
asking for money oh yeah I see so many
of them and I feel so bad because I

973
01:13:24.179 --> 01:13:27.360
don't have cash and there's like 20 and
change like Looney's and toonies and

974
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.920
stuff
Nick and James go to chechnya

975
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:39.120
and end up in church boys check voice
is it checha or chechnya or check check

976
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.340
yeah okay I want to do it I I want to do
a parody of check Hunter where it's like

977
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.300
handing like the wad of cash to a boy uh
to a guy and then like then that cuts to

978
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.679
a scene where he's like giving like an
Oscar performance like

979
01:13:52.679 --> 01:14:00.120
what some serious acting instead
can you still use cash in Canada a lot I

980
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.420
feel like in the US a lot of places
don't oh places love cash because

981
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:08.159
there's if you give them Cash There's no
um transaction fee

982
01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:12.480
um so places love cash I just never
carry it because it's a literally a pain

983
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.880
in the ass so there's like no spot for
cash in my wallet

984
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:25.260
Sue David of Torah wants to know if
you're in Toronto who so David of tour

985
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:29.760

this is Bed Head actually I haven't been

988
01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.480
in the shower yet
James if you come drive by my house I'll

989
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.520

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.679
I'm in the U.S and still use past a good
amount I never have trouble with it

991
01:14:52.679 --> 01:14:57.060
have you guys bought we do have our
Barbie tickets I'm so excited to a VIP

992
01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.699
screening my mom wanted to know if she
could come with us I'm like Mom we

993
01:14:59.699 --> 01:15:04.620
already got the tickets yeah I'm sorry
I'll go see it again with you if it's

994
01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:09.980
good
I'm so excited for this movie

995
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.719
rom-com I'll go see it because it'll be
Champion fun but no like no looking at

996
01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:22.440
the trailers like there's a plot here
there's pathos going on Margaret roby's

997
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.860
gonna get an Oscar off of it no I
haven't gotten the Margot Roby Barbie

998
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.580
toy yet I think they're only at Toys R
Us here so I have to go to Toys R Us we

999
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.620
can go to Toys R Us uh it's it's not a
VIP like ooh fancy persons it's just

1000
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:38.640
like they they'll serve alcohol that's
that's well thank you David and they

1001
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.980
have really comfy seats they have like
recliners

1002
01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.420
she can afford it she would
um no I'm so excited for this movie like

1003
01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:52.199
there's Margaret I I really would like
Margot Robbie to get her Oscar off of

1004
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:58.140
this hilarious iconic
no but my prediction for the movie is

1005
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.560
that we're seeing a lot of just kind of
funny sitcomy stuff in the trailers but

1006
01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.159
I think this is going to be like a
pathological explanation about the idea

1007
01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:09.719
of woman and girlhood Womanhood and girl
hood and that's kind of what I that's

1008
01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:12.659
what I think is going to go on from what
I hear Mattel makes it difficult to buy

1009
01:16:12.659 --> 01:16:17.100
their dolls outside of America oh we
have we have all the parts like American

1010
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:21.360
Canada are basically the same country
like sales wise like Mattel kind of

1011
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.800
recently did a push for like having that
kind of huge line of Barbies where it's

1012
01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.920
like all different body types and
different skin colors and stuff

1013
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.800
um and they look gorgeous and if I was a
doll collector I would have been into

1014
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.560
that yeah
um and but I don't think it's as

1015
01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.480
organized here as it is in the states
Maybe

1016
01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.020
but they are there like especially Toys
R Us I know that at Toys R Us there are

1017
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.380
because
um Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling were in

1018
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:51.360
Toronto and they went to a Toys R Us in
the area and there was a huge display of

1019
01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.840
them and it was their Barbie and Ken and
they were showing them off and stuff

1020
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.679
because they're doing all of their press
now three weeks before the movie comes

1021
01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:03.560
out because the actors are going on
strike and then they can't do press

1022
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:10.380
a lot of movie theaters in SoCal have
recliners and serve booze normally now

1023
01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.760
yeah we only have one movie theater
chain in Canada Cineplex that's it so

1024
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.380
it's like two I thought we had two no we
only have one oh it's only Cineplex and

1025
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.520
how are we not getting price gouged we
still pay less per viewing than America

1026
01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.659
does I know I I think it's because they
know that if they did start price

1027
01:17:27.659 --> 01:17:31.440
gouging then the government would kind
of force them to break up or something

1028
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.739
the Canadian Market is so small if they
started pressing Canadians just wouldn't

1029
01:17:34.739 --> 01:17:38.840
would stop going to see movies and they
wouldn't make any money

1030
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:44.360
would that be better for the U.S or just
worse

1031
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:51.120
don't dare Canada
no like I like my Healthcare like there

1032
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.140
was a big fear about the idea of Quebec
separating because Quebec is connecting

1033
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.400
uh the rest of Canada to Eastern Canada
the coastal provinces that would be Nova

1034
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.600
Scotia New Brunswick pein and people
assume that the Atlantic provinces would

1035
01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.199
get consumed into the us because the
Atlantic provinces don't have the

1036
01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:11.159
economy to live on their own they do
actually they're just not allowed to use

1037
01:18:11.159 --> 01:18:14.580
the resources because of contracts and
such not yeah

1038
01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.020
um how much are tickets in Canada around
10 bucks 10 bucks uh for like the VIP

1039
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:25.040
tickets they're 20 and iMacs are 20 but
a normal movie ticket is 10 bucks

1040
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:32.820
versus Oppenheimer uh the projections
came out for the for what they said that

1041
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:37.920
was hilarious where Oppenheimer the 300
million dollar movie where Christopher

1042
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.080
Nolan created a new kind of film stock
so he could shoot black and white iMacs

1043
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.360
uh is uh tracking at 40 million dollar
opening weekend and Barbie's tracking at

1044
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.219
80.
what is it at 40 60 million dollar movie

1045
01:18:53.219 --> 01:18:58.159
I forget the but it's something around
there it's not expensive yeah

1046
01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.659
for the greater good would you allow
Canada to integrate with the US no no

1047
01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:07.699
if America wants to become a part of
Canada and give up all of its politics

1048
01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:11.820
we'll take we'll do the we'll do it on a
state by state basis yeah you gotta you

1049
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.980
gotta get your together yeah but
like we're not joining the US no uh Aura

1050
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.179
fantastica Canada is a large country so
there are definitely definitely

1051
01:19:21.179 --> 01:19:25.860
beautiful spots where I grew up is
physically very beautiful and boring but

1052
01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.640
it's only beautiful for like two months
out of the year yeah

1053
01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.120
um where I grew up is actually like the
prime tourist one of the Prime tour

1054
01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.480
assassinations of the entire country
because that's like Cottage like the art

1055
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.820
typical Cottage country of Canada uh I
love the west coast of Canada

1056
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.780
I've never been to the West Coast it's
been to the West Coast I've never been

1057
01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:51.000
most places really I've been outside of
the of the pro of the country holy

1058
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.159
it's cold do you find it cold yes you're
the one who keeps it so cold well what's

1059
01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:59.880
the area the air conditioner is behind
you I'm talking I'm on a lot I'll get

1060
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.260
around to it so like how about you move
so I'll handle it in a second oh my God

1061
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:08.219
okay so I've been out of the country
I've traveled a lot

1062
01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:11.040
um like I've been to the great I've seen
the Grand Canyon I thought it was

1063
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.880
overrated sorry American friendos it's
just a hole in the ground it really is

1064
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.060
there are much more interesting canyons
in that area I've seen much more

1065
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:23.280
interesting holes
but no I I my favorite Canyon when we

1066
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.820
went my grandparents lived in Salt Lake
City for a few a few years with that

1067
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:31.380
grandfather's job uh we did the trip
from Salt Lake City to the Grand Canyon

1068
01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:35.159
I liked a canyon called Bryce Canyon the
best but whatever

1069
01:20:35.159 --> 01:20:38.460
um
so like I've always been to Peru did a

1070
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.640
lot of traveling around Peru I nothing
really compared to British Columbia that

1071
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.120
is still my favorite place on the planet
that I've been but I want to see more

1072
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.699
places so I'll fix the air conditioner

1073
01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:56.179
it's just a 20. put it to 22.

1074
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.679
which U.S state will you accept into
Canada uh California Oregon and

1075
01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:05.640
Washington they can come board
uh Massachusetts

1076
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.560
they want to join Canada really badly
we take Massachusetts they're not

1077
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.199
directly connected to us though so we'd
have to take like New Hampshire and

1078
01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:19.199
Maine at the same time
no no it isn't going to be a problem

1079
01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:24.420
Maine elect some weird people though
Ontario elective Doug Ford

1080
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.780
that's true
and his brother

1081
01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:32.159
I can see Vermont definitely by having a
good time no not New York New York is

1082
01:21:32.159 --> 01:21:35.159
boring
we were actually just talking about this

1083
01:21:35.159 --> 01:21:41.300
today that New York and London are
basically just like ah City TM

1084
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.380
and honestly from what I've heard about
New Yorkers they would really realize

1085
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.280
people not from New York saying that
it's boring

1086
01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.280
there's so many good people coming to
New York expecting it to be an

1087
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.780
interesting place
jacking up the price of real estate what

1088
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:01.260
Canon should Canadians be doing to
support queer people in the U.S what can

1089
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:06.719
we do about Asylum for U.S queer people
well the government's already allowing

1090
01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:10.679
um Asylum specifically for Trans people
uh from the U.S I thought they were

1091
01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:13.320
talking about expanding that to all
Queer people though uh they might right

1092
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.820
now it's for Trans people but there
might be an extension an expansion

1093
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.940
um

1094
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:25.140
other than that moral support because
like you can donate to as many Charities

1095
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:29.040
as you want but if the state basically
makes it illegal to be trans Charities

1096
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.760
can't do anything
um

1097
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:37.440
so basically just kind of letting people
know that they that there are people who

1098
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.860
care about them is really important I
find

1099
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.520
um like with my videos I try and put a
positive ending on everything and that

1100
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.820
seems to help a lot of people and I'm
really happy about that so I think just

1101
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:52.460
kind of moral support
hey Jason

1102
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.600
I like living in New York and I wouldn't
say it's boring but it's nowhere near as

1103
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.040
interesting as most people not from here
thing yeah like I I wouldn't say New

1104
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.580
York is boring but it's you know it's
physically boring it's just a bunch of

1105
01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.480
tall buildings well like yeah because
like I've heard about this Manhattan New

1106
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.560
York for a lot of people is that they uh
New Yorkers kind of they talk about how

1107
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.580
media and things will kind of exasperate
New York and New York is the place where

1108
01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:20.280
you come to make all your dreams come
true and it's all like Taylor Swift you

1109
01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.800
go into New York and you have a
penthouse and you can think about how

1110
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.860
great New York is whereas like people
who have lived from New York for their

1111
01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:29.760
entire life they're like yeah it's got
shitty Parts about it

1112
01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.460
um
and of course New York seems magical

1113
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:37.380
when you're moving into penthouse yeah
um I just found and returned two poodle

1114
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.520
puppies to their owner

1115
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.980
uh I don't think Sex In The City is to
blame for that because a lot of Sex In

1116
01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:51.739
The City is pointing out how shooting
New York is yeah I blame friends

1117
01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.280
and honestly I one thing I meant to
mention I we touched on it briefly in

1118
01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.980
the more recent video about rent the
gazen theater the idea that New York uh

1119
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.679
I I think rent is a big problem with
that too because it paints New York

1120
01:24:04.679 --> 01:24:08.640
especially New York poverty as this
magical place yeah or anything can

1121
01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.140
happen is at the same time the point of
rent is wow doesn't it suck to be poor

1122
01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:17.159
but also the point of rent is wow isn't
it kind of cool to be poor in New York

1123
01:24:17.159 --> 01:24:21.780
yeah like
so um and even we might be poor but at

1124
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:25.760
least we're in New York where is that
from

1125
01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.140
I feel like that was a line in 30 Rock

1126
01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.340
um 30 Rock another show that demystifies
New York anywhere in Canada that doesn't

1127
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:40.080
get bad freezes in the winter uh
Vancouver doesn't but Vancouver is also

1128
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.679
very is Vancouver more expensive than
Toronto

1129
01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:49.140
when you get into the city proper yes
but in the there are suburbs and areas

1130
01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:53.280
around around where like my distance
from the city would that be any more

1131
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.000
expensive than what I'm probably not but
I've also heard that in terms of Toronto

1132
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.300
it's much more livelier in regular areas
around the city I've heard that

1133
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.239
Vancouver is also just kind of a lot
more

1134
01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:06.719
quiet there's not as much life and
Vibrance to the city

1135
01:25:06.719 --> 01:25:09.320
okay okay

1136
01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.780
they never should have done a New York
the original is much better Toronto has

1137
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:20.400
a North York we do I was there the we
were there the other day breathing in

1138
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.840
toxic smoke and yeah so New York has
this kind of Aura of having a being this

1139
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.040
fantastic place about no it's so great
in New York and people who actually live

1140
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.040
in Newark I'm really are like I'm sick
of these people who are not from New

1141
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.860
York coming to the city thinking it's
going to make all their dreams come true

1142
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:39.360
and then realizing they actually hate
the city it's like get out please yeah

1143
01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.219
the only thing I like about rent was the
I want to go out tonight

1144
01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:48.120
it's like fairness I'd rather be poor in
New York than where I was born in

1145
01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:54.620
Michigan
yeah being poor in Michigan would suck

1146
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:04.500
I like mooing with Marine sounds like a
children's show moving with Marines PJ

1147
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.040
Katie's Farm
I feel like the perception of New York

1148
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:11.699
is kind of similar to Mexico City for
foreigners tours I love it but living in

1149
01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:14.540
it is kind of depressing

1150
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:20.580
being poor kind of sucks bro
I feel like being poor anywhere as

1151
01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.600
someone who grew up poor
it sucks anywhere yeah

1152
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.580
like I mean I was so poor that we would
drop we would travel five hours to visit

1153
01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:36.239
my aunt who lived in the city I lived in
before in in Nova Scotia and I would my

1154
01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:40.560
big like
Excursion on these trips would be to go

1155
01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.880
to the mall and ride the escalators
James why are you so much clearer than I

1156
01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.360
am
um I'm like not clear you're super clear

1157
01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.120
right here okay
afraid my camera sucks

1158
01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.960
we have the same camera I know that's
why I'm worried do I have like a factory

1159
01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.500
defect does mine oh there there we go
I'm just further away from the camera

1160
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:06.000
than you are hi poor
you'll make more money here than

1161
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
anywhere
what New York yeah but it costs more to

1162
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.620
live in New York so it kind of evens out

1163
01:27:14.219 --> 01:27:18.480
I heard that is queer queer what did I
say is queer work queer what did I say

1164
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.139
what did I actually say I don't know
because I very well might have said

1165
01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:29.280
queerer like
queer clearer clearer clearer

1166
01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:37.860
have you had any oh no he's hot moments
I've had a lot of oh no he's hot moments

1167
01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:43.219
who regarding who specifically
oh oh

1168
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.620
it was actually really recently and I
can't remember

1169
01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.060
I think it might have been in person
okay from Detroit have you seen scary

1170
01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:01.380
movie before it's just like that
it's just like that before and after the

1171
01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.580
aliens attack no difference

1172
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.900
being a point

1173
01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.699
which of you is queer
that's a good question that has

1174
01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:18.600
different areas like yeah again like
you're not you you're the one who's got

1175
01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.199
passing for straight but you can also
talk about musicals and a lot of stuff

1176
01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:29.760
I didn't actually see that did you get
it okay okay okay that's interesting

1177
01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.659
foreign

1178
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.100
here's Detroit and here's Detroit after
the attack

1179
01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:43.020
please y'all pray for me I have no hot
water until Monday oh my God that sucks

1180
01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.219
that's awful

1181
01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.719
encyclopedic memory of Sex in the City
um seen every episode of The Golden

1182
01:28:51.719 --> 01:28:56.400
Girls twice
um

1183
01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.940
Broadway musicals
in general

1184
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:11.719
my conservative Catholic roommate was an
oh no he's hot that relationship was hot

1185
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.460
I pass and I'm probably safer for that
but I hate when straight people tell me

1186
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.239
you don't look gay

1187
01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.840
I've been told I don't act gay but I've
never been told I don't look gay

1188
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:32.820
actually I have I have I have been told
I don't look like a gay man because I'm

1189
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.480
not in shape apparently I don't
apparently I look like a fascist

1190
01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.080
yes

1191
01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:44.580
that comment has been made
um horror asked are you Pro or anti-guns

1192
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.760
in America I don't think guns are the
problem

1193
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.000
I I think they should be regulated
heavily I think there should be

1194
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.880
background tracks I think that the
government should know where guns are

1195
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.540
going and where ammunition is going but
I think that the issue with America is

1196
01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:04.380
much deeper than just guns or no guns
I think America I agree I think the

1197
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:07.760
issue is not necessarily

1198
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.820
that guns are legal it's that the type
of guns that are legal and how easy it

1199
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:21.060
is to get guns and who can get them
uh that being said much like a toddler

1200
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:26.280
who has thrown paint on the walls one
too many times America has lost its

1201
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.540
privilege and you need to take a show
that it is a grown-up and can handle

1202
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.780
things yeah so you take the paint away
and you put it on top of the fridge yeah

1203
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:41.040
you take the guns away and melt them
down and make some kind of a statue of

1204
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.360
something something

1205
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:50.420
everything Nick just said is probably
why people think he's a fascist

1206
01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:55.679
which is weird because I'm arguing that
the problem is a root cause that's

1207
01:30:55.679 --> 01:30:59.400
deeper than the and I I work coming from
Jason because like people kind of like

1208
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.460
to latch on to one or two specific
sentences out of a whole and kind of

1209
01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.320
just you know build an entire point off
of that but like you know we need to dig

1210
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.179
deeper to solve the root cause

1211
01:31:13.699 --> 01:31:19.620
oh I've got to head up oh have a good
night night game witch melt guns for the

1212
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:23.219
Baphomet statue
I think there's also an issue with gun

1213
01:31:23.219 --> 01:31:27.600
culture and specifically in America yeah
it's fascinating to see gun history in

1214
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.219
America how it went from a more communal
defense to the insanity that is today

1215
01:31:32.219 --> 01:31:38.780
yeah America is broken in general and we
need to uh reboot

1216
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:45.239
melt guns make swords I would you know
I'd be on board for that make Americans

1217
01:31:45.239 --> 01:31:51.780
have swords instead of guns I did buy a
ghost of sushima replica sword set

1218
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:57.179
fantastic for that
also lightsabers yes I'm excited for

1219
01:31:57.179 --> 01:32:00.960
that well one of them is mine yeah I
don't know where they are though

1220
01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:05.520
where's my phone I can protect our
children but screw them if you take our

1221
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.060
guns away

1222
01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:18.420
guys rip turn the pages of Tom Finland
swords are way cooler than guns

1223
01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:21.360
like
guns are just like

1224
01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.219
a little metal thing
pew pew pew

1225
01:32:26.219 --> 01:32:31.139
a sword like if you kill someone with a
sword you have to be like within range

1226
01:32:31.139 --> 01:32:36.080
of them it's so much more metal you
gotta earn it yeah

1227
01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.800
it's also crazy what percent of the
population actually owns all those guns

1228
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:49.080
yes it is very
good oh no

1229
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.580
not a boy
because Canada actually has more guns

1230
01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:57.600
per capita than the United States we
just don't kill each other

1231
01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.540
and we have regulations about how you
need to store these guns how you can

1232
01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:03.420
keep these guns there's a list of people
about

1233
01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:07.679
and this is the conflation it's like
oh we froze

1234
01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:13.920
we did
afros no oh I just paused never mind and

1235
01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.080
everyone got a flash of my bad Dragon
stickers

1236
01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:22.500
what did you do when did you start doing
uh I do streams all the time they're not

1237
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.460
just Friday night they're random nights
of the week

1238
01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.000
um
but sometimes Friday night now that like

1239
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.739
now that lick now that Nick actually
lives in the city we might make it uh a

1240
01:33:34.739 --> 01:33:38.360
regular thing regular thing through the
summer

1241
01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.880
that's why horror villains use stab
weapons instead of guns cause they're

1242
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.540
cooler
as someone who owns a lot of sharp

1243
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:53.580
objects who is currently playing with a
package of exacto knives

1244
01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:57.480
put away before I that reminds me we
need to play the Splatoon event Splatoon

1245
01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.940
yes Splatoon Splatoon

1246
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:06.239
more streams please I love those guys
those little squidy guys little octo

1247
01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:11.239
guys they're like my favorite I love
them so much

1248
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:15.540
Nick is finding the Karen angle on
camera

1249
01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:20.420
what's the Karen angle on cameras I
don't know I need to equip myself

1250
01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:25.320
usually when you stream I'm having
dinner or drawing or both so it's easy

1251
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.060
background noise and when I'm less busy
I try to be in chat oh

1252
01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.440
y'all like Mario what do you think about
the new Mario games uh I think they look

1253
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.320
fun
most Mario games are fun though

1254
01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.639
other than uh Mario Sunshine I've never
played one that wasn't fun

1255
01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:48.540
I've heard that about sunshine before
but apparently like it picks up a lot in

1256
01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:52.380
later in the game
I had came to the conclusion of years

1257
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:56.159
years ago when they released the Mario
Trilogy that they kind of put out yeah

1258
01:34:56.159 --> 01:35:01.860
that I just am not a Mario person
for me they're just they're not like

1259
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.520
it's not like Zelda where I will put
hundreds of hours into it it's just it's

1260
01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.719
like a Time killer game it's like oh I
have nothing to do I can play Mario

1261
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.360
yeah for me it's like I I think that
they're just not my style games I don't

1262
01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.300
really like the platformer style I'm
excited about the RPG though that looks

1263
01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.719
like fun the Remake yeah yeah I'm
excited because I tried playing the

1264
01:35:21.719 --> 01:35:26.760
remake A couple of years ago
um I might try and pick get into uh

1265
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.860
Paper Mario again apparently uh they
started out phenomenal got progressively

1266
01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.000
works but are still really good games uh
sorry I didn't get worse got

1267
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.880
progressively not as good hmm
Sunshine is 100 a broken game but I love

1268
01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.920
the setting and the controls the new
Zelda game made link a guy he was

1269
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:53.100
non-binary in The Originals what what no
Link's always been a guy yeah

1270
01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.760
I think Nick I think I think link is
closer to non-binary now than ever

1271
01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:01.800
before honestly
I am sad that he doesn't you can't get

1272
01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.719
the um Gerudo fam outfit yeah
probably at least

1273
01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:11.520
Barbie at least the older made ones made
excellent weapons oh I've played all the

1274
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.699
Bayonetta games I'm working on cereza
and the lost demon really good game I

1275
01:36:14.699 --> 01:36:20.219
love that I haven't played I haven't
finished it uh not a huge fan of bo3

1276
01:36:20.219 --> 01:36:24.239
um
because of the ending I think no no I

1277
01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:26.699
think the whole game didn't really hold
together very well I heard that

1278
01:36:26.699 --> 01:36:31.560
apparently that game went through like
50 different rewrites and redevelopments

1279
01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:37.139
I think story wise peaked at Bayo 2 but
design and character concept and and

1280
01:36:37.139 --> 01:36:42.080
everything peaked in one
one was better for design

1281
01:36:42.179 --> 01:36:46.739
s in the last team is better than all of
them so I'm not afraid of Hollywood

1282
01:36:46.739 --> 01:36:50.280
messing up my dreams I'm afraid of this
 country I live in messing up my

1283
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.280
dreams
um honestly Hollywood is Hollywood's a

1284
01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.719
it's a game of who you know and I don't
know anyone in Hollywood like with power

1285
01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:04.560
I know people who are like actors and
stuff like that but not like producers

1286
01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.020
and stuff like that so
the worst that Hollywood could do is say

1287
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.960
no you have to keep doing exactly what
you're doing now

1288
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:20.040
and it's like all right but the current
idiots in my government running my

1289
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.420
country are trying to stop that from
happening so I'm really not worried

1290
01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.040
about Hollywood at all

1291
01:37:29.159 --> 01:37:32.520
because like with Hollywood movies I
don't want to make Hollywood movies like

1292
01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.300
I don't want someone to give me 200
million dollars to make a movie

1293
01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:40.080
like why

1294
01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:49.920
Nick I want ice cream
random I want to go to the gelato place

1295
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:55.739
last night but I didn't
then by the time that I worked up the um

1296
01:37:55.739 --> 01:38:01.080
gumption to go out it was closed
a24 isn't really Hollywood though

1297
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.620
can't you take that 200 million to make
four movies you wouldn't think that

1298
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.820
would be the logic not the way Studios
work though because most of that money

1299
01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:14.760
is earmarked for to go to companies the
studio actually owns themselves uh but

1300
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.880
then they can say they spent money well
not just that but after the spurge of

1301
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.420
Marvel movies everyone's trying to ape
on that they want that oh the more money

1302
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:25.100
we spend on a movie the more money we'll
get on a movie and it's like

1303
01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.860
please look at what was going on with
the DC Cinematic Universe while Marvel

1304
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.880
was making bank like
James will you make animated movies I'd

1305
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.260
love to but animated movies are really
expensive we have a few ideas for

1306
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.219
animated content though
but uh

1307
01:38:41.219 --> 01:38:45.179
if we can get more money for Telos I
would love to do animated movies but as

1308
01:38:45.179 --> 01:38:48.600
of right now
um

1309
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.320
no

1310
01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.280
can't you make an eight-hour movie then
say you have to split it into four parts

1311
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.500
they did that it was called Lord of the
Rings

1312
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.659
so that was called The Hobbit
no I mean like they shot all of the Lord

1313
01:39:03.659 --> 01:39:07.980
of the Rings trilogy at once yeah um and
furthermore Peter had bought Peter

1314
01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:13.080
Jackson uh Jr Tolkien no yes yes Gerald
Hogan tried to

1315
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.000
he tried to write publish it all as one
book yeah but there's a paper shortage

1316
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.139
after World War II yeah so it's meant to
be one story and you know you can kind

1317
01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:25.280
of marathon them and they hold up

1318
01:39:32.219 --> 01:39:37.980
in the new Zelda Link is treated as a
boy the Gerudo say is a Vo

1319
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.900
and yeah that's the last one too yeah
and that was it's always been a boy that

1320
01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:47.840
was a no crane no time they wanted him
out of there because he was a guy yeah

1321
01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:59.520
Jr Tolkien wasn't a conservative in the
modern sense of a conservative uh Gerard

1322
01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.120
Tolkien wanted to conserve like the the
sort of rural areas of England which is

1323
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.699
very different from like literally
conserve yeah physical spaces yeah not

1324
01:40:11.699 --> 01:40:16.679
I don't want people
to like because if you read we would

1325
01:40:16.679 --> 01:40:19.739
consider Lord of the Rings Progressive
by today's standards because it's

1326
01:40:19.739 --> 01:40:25.020
environmentally focused you know Lord of
the Rings was adopted by hippies yeah

1327
01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.380
in the sense that he he wanted to
conserve both the environment and the

1328
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:31.620
lifestyle of the way that people lived
in the country which was being overtaken

1329
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.000
by industrialism uh these changes and
one thing I do want to point out to a

1330
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.760
lot of people because a lot of people do
rag on progressivism and they say that a

1331
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.540
progressive used to be a dirty word it's
like these words change to fit the

1332
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:47.159
political climate they exist in yeah
James if you did regularly schedule

1333
01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:51.600
lives you may get more watching I might
but honestly unless there was a bunch of

1334
01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.800
super chats and stuff like that
happening regularly scheduling them just

1335
01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.600
doesn't work for me

1336
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.659
because then I have to like organize my
day and set time aside and stuff like

1337
01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:12.420
that and then I would just end up
getting frustrated and

1338
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:17.400
and like I love when you guys send super
chats I really really appreciate it but

1339
01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.780
it's like there's never really enough
super chats for to to Warrant like

1340
01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:28.080
scheduling specific streams this is not
the and that's okay that's just not the

1341
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.040
climate of this channel some channels
they can make money only on streaming

1342
01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:35.719
and then buy multi-million dollar
mansions in California

1343
01:41:35.719 --> 01:41:42.780
uh after who's that Hassan oh yeah after
providing virtually little literally

1344
01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:48.739
nothing and basically just having
nepotism on your side oh thank you

1345
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.699
um and you know where James and I are
comfortable with uh the the means of

1346
01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:56.699
income that the channel offers yeah and
we're going to be doing a bunch of extra

1347
01:41:56.699 --> 01:41:59.219
stuff for patrons during the summer
because we're not going to be releasing

1348
01:41:59.219 --> 01:42:03.600
any videos to YouTube over the summer
um but we've got a bunch of extra stuff

1349
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.020
coming for patrons uh Masala monkey we
used to play games on streams they

1350
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:11.100
missed those days we did nobody watched
I ever I might start doing that on my

1351
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.020
own
um if you wouldn't mind like kind of

1352
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.400
just getting a set up at my place and
just playing The Sims or something

1353
01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.360
building werewolf boyfriends

1354
01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.420
true uh senior
um

1355
01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:28.199
like American Democrats are basically
conservatives almost everywhere else in

1356
01:42:28.199 --> 01:42:31.460
the country in the world yeah

1357
01:42:35.239 --> 01:42:41.880
Tolkien had very intimate uh
relationships with the men he went to

1358
01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:47.520
World War One like for instance like is
it gay to continue writing uh very

1359
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.719
emotional letters to your friend who was
lost in the war no he was dead for the

1360
01:42:51.719 --> 01:42:58.639
rest of your life yeah he wasn't gay but
yes he was very possibly bisexual

1361
01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:03.600
I think more people are bisexual than
they give credit for I think the vast

1362
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:07.860
majority of people were bisexual I would
say like 70 of the population I think

1363
01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.560
that people are just
um and this also includes gay people I

1364
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.900
think a lot more gay people are by than
they realize because I think that

1365
01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.900
there's this kind of mentality oh you
need to pick a camp you depend on your

1366
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.400
other heterosex you're either straight
or you're not I'm gay I don't like women

1367
01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.460
I don't think it's a matter of these
people just need to open their mind I

1368
01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.880
think it's a matter of conditioning has
you know let the clothes off you know

1369
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.060
sections of uh what they what they
tolerate like for me I'm attracted to

1370
01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:35.520
body types rather than body types and
gender manifestations rather than parts

1371
01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.659
um I'm attracted to men and men only
sure

1372
01:43:39.659 --> 01:43:44.239
um bring your head over here I need to
Pat it why because good for you

1373
01:43:44.239 --> 01:43:49.400
not a thing well men and

1374
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:54.480
um non-binary people yeah whereas I'm
not attracted to non-binary people sorry

1375
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.100
folks like androgyny just doesn't work
for me phobic

1376
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:04.920
no no I'm not married
does this work for me

1377
01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.900
um
but I think that you know we think of

1378
01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:15.060
their memories in high school you knew
those guys who are always together who

1379
01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:18.780
had girlfriends yeah but they would
rather be together they spent way more

1380
01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.980
time together than with people friends
if they had a if they've had a falling

1381
01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:31.980
out it was biblical in scope oh yeah oh
it was it was it like Cecil B Demille

1382
01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:37.020
would adapt that everyone in school
had to pick a side yes these two this

1383
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.900
Bromance had a falling out because you
could not be friends with both of them

1384
01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:44.520
that that was a that is a non-sexual
romantic relationship

1385
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.340
and I think that's
if it was non-sexual but it was

1386
01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.840
certainly romantic well it might be sex
actor would be more president than in

1387
01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.960
society for people to be more
open-minded than maybe it would be yeah

1388
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.260
but also bro sex is apparently a thing
guys who aren't romantically attracted

1389
01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.340
to guys but who you know will have sex
with them I knew plenty of guys in high

1390
01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.179
school who had some sort of sex with
each other

1391
01:45:06.179 --> 01:45:11.280
um especially on like sports trips and
stuff when they would be out of town uh

1392
01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.159
for competitions and stuff because there
was no one around except them and so

1393
01:45:17.159 --> 01:45:20.520
they didn't have to answer to anyone I
also want to point out

1394
01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:26.520
that there's a lot of very straight guys
who try to do the sexy thing but the

1395
01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:29.580
cringe
you know you know what I mean

1396
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:33.900
like they no okay straight guys who
tried to kind of put on these sexy

1397
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:36.420
errors but it doesn't work because they
don't understand what sex young guys

1398
01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:40.560
because they're not interested in guys I
think to have an acknowledgment of what

1399
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.520
is sexually appealing for your own
gender you do need to be able to tap

1400
01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.960
into a bit of same sex attraction to be
able to self-assess is this sexual or

1401
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.980
not is this sexy or not
hmm

1402
01:45:55.739 --> 01:46:00.719
just remember John Laurens and Alexander
Hamilton's letters oh yeah

1403
01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:06.900
uh Jason I would not continue writing to
letters or letters to James after he

1404
01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:11.179
died and I didn't write letters to me
now no

1405
01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.639
foreign

1406
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:22.860
token is a lot of flippancy on my part
um I really am not of one mind of it one

1407
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.400
way or the other

1408
01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:37.619
and yeah I feel like people who are
completely like have no concept of how

1409
01:46:37.619 --> 01:46:41.040
to present themselves in a sexual way I
don't think that they

1410
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.060
are able to tap into a an area of
self-assessment to gauge their own

1411
01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:48.900
gender attraction attractiveness being
attracted to men has indeed given me a

1412
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:52.260
very precise understanding of how
repulsive I am to them

1413
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.880
I feel you I feel you

1414
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.920
the movie I feel so much Beyond
friendship

1415
01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.880
uh I don't want to spell my type because
that varies from time to time but

1416
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:25.139
basically I like Barra
[Laughter]

1417
01:47:25.139 --> 01:47:31.040
I I have a big thing for big strong
himbos like

1418
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.880
where who wear wigs under what contacts
me Nick

1419
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.619
I've never worn a wig
I bought a wig for the ant for one of

1420
01:47:43.619 --> 01:47:46.920
the videos I can't remember which one I
think it was the skate video I bought a

1421
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:50.780
wig and I was like this does not work no

1422
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.880
um I don't know roach dog I I need a lot
more time to flush out that theory

1423
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.360
attraction

1424
01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:13.380
leather daddies
no Bara it's a Japanese type of

1425
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.300
um porn
whereas by type is like just completely

1426
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:23.100
random depending okay this is my ideal
type but I'm attracted to I have

1427
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:28.619
attraction to a lot more a very wide
range but as I if I had to draw my

1428
01:48:28.619 --> 01:48:33.600
perfect imaginary boyfriend for some God
or deity to bring to life I'd say like

1429
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:39.060
okay I got some I got a list like
but honestly that's the only real body

1430
01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:46.040
body type thing that comes into into
play a lot more is Personality yeah

1431
01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.760
when will you wear wigs as a Lord of the
Rings meme apparently

1432
01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.460
never heard
I've never heard that either

1433
01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:06.960
bar is a Japanese word for Rose but in
gay context it's a slur but it's also an

1434
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.600
artistic literature that's
a pedigree for one word James you look

1435
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.920
like Debbie from The Addams Family

1436
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.920
pastels

1437
01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.820
oh

1438
01:49:35.239 --> 01:49:41.460
Malibu Barbie
James I bet you are top I am versed

1439
01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.639
actually

1440
01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.840
though I've only had sex once in like a
decade so

1441
01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.960
yeah

1442
01:49:51.719 --> 01:49:57.000
you got off work
you got offers

1443
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.679
we have not anyone I'm interested in

1444
01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.340
is it just that you're and I had to pay
for it is it just that the offers you're

1445
01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:10.500
getting are like you know your your
standards are too high or

1446
01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:16.580
because if like you've got other I don't
think my standards are too high

1447
01:50:16.679 --> 01:50:23.219
um because you know I have a very broad
range of what I find attractive

1448
01:50:23.219 --> 01:50:26.400
um
the the ones I get offers from are

1449
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:35.360
either somehow out of that range
or they're just cringe oh

1450
01:50:40.739 --> 01:50:45.679
James is a living Ikea shark plush toy

1451
01:50:46.739 --> 01:50:51.060
dude you have to have a connection
before getting to sex it's nice to have

1452
01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:54.840
a connection prefer that
like even if it's just like talking to

1453
01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.800
someone for a couple of days like just
so that it's not like complete like I

1454
01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.420
couldn't do a bath house kind of
situation uh Barbara I'm actually kind

1455
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.320
of Ace
um I'm on the ace Spectrum I don't want

1456
01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:12.619
to get too deep into it because it's a
it's a head full of stuff

1457
01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:19.500
was Nick about to clip out what was that
clip out like I think that's when I

1458
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.659
forced myself to sit up straight in my
chair oh

1459
01:51:24.179 --> 01:51:28.679
sometimes you feel like a top
sometimes you feel like a top I mean

1460
01:51:28.679 --> 01:51:32.940
like sometimes wouldn't that work if it
better for sex if it was like sometimes

1461
01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:36.420
you feel like you need to not sometimes
you don't when do you not feel like you

1462
01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.440
need to knot right now

1463
01:51:42.139 --> 01:51:46.739
I have this thing that if I know the
actor in a porn more than the basic I

1464
01:51:46.739 --> 01:51:52.199
find it harder to find I can't get uh I
I have actively refused remember we were

1465
01:51:52.199 --> 01:51:55.020
living in Ottawa and you're trying to
tell me about porn stars I'm like I need

1466
01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:58.440
to not know about them yeah I need to
not think and this is I feel bad saying

1467
01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:01.980
this I need to not think about them as
human beings or otherwise I will feel so

1468
01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:06.360
horribly inadequate for not looking like
that and for not having sex like that I

1469
01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.320
had an online friend who was a pretty
well known porn star for quite a while

1470
01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.480
and he kind of told me all the ins and
outs of porn and I can't watch porn for

1471
01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.699
likes any kind of sexual stuff anymore I
I watch it and I'm like I critique it

1472
01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:24.600
but that's like the in my head I
critique it and that's about the the

1473
01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:30.540
gist of it because I know every like I
know why that cut was made I know like

1474
01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:34.380
why was that cup made James well it's
like I knew I I know because I'm

1475
01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:38.159
watching and I'm like oh his his leg is
tilting and there's a cut and it's like

1476
01:52:38.159 --> 01:52:44.040
he fell over like stuff like that like I
can see I can see how all of the all of

1477
01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:48.540
the I can see all the connections for
the Lego basically and so it doesn't

1478
01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:51.679
just doesn't work

1479
01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.340
uh Michael there is no Haze code

1480
01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:07.100
the haze code ended in the 50s I mean
we're still feeling the options

1481
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:11.460
certain patterns and traditions were
built during the haze code that are

1482
01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:14.179
still lasting

1483
01:53:16.619 --> 01:53:21.360
Chad James the porn critic
do you like more amateur stuff then I

1484
01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.739
like my amateur stuff
um

1485
01:53:24.739 --> 01:53:30.659
amateur stuff just sucks I'm very
Discerning when it comes to it I've

1486
01:53:30.659 --> 01:53:34.739
I hate it when there's a guy on only
fans that produces really good stuff and

1487
01:53:34.739 --> 01:53:38.880
then the quality just keeps dipping
like early on it's like wow you made

1488
01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.820
some really great stuff and then it's
just like you don't serve anymore

1489
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.199
is that so many porn performers are
really hot and they've got the

1490
01:53:49.199 --> 01:53:52.920
personality of a wet paper towel and
they don't make any noise they don't

1491
01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.820
talk they don't do anything there's
there's like it is just a body and

1492
01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:01.400
that's it and I'm like I could care less

1493
01:54:03.659 --> 01:54:09.659
like a consistent concrete like a
consistent content creator uh as we're

1494
01:54:09.659 --> 01:54:13.920
about to take two months off from
YouTube I mean we've been over producing

1495
01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.639
for a long time
yeah

1496
01:54:17.639 --> 01:54:22.800
well kind of if he's code had never
existed Hollywood would be very

1497
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.360
different it would be impossible for the
haze code not to exist I'm America very

1498
01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:30.300
different it will America America would
have had to be different because America

1499
01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:35.460
is very puritanical the only reason the
haze code existed was because

1500
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:40.760
um American religious movements and the
women's rights movement basically pushed

1501
01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.320
so hard against Hollywood that they had
to create the haze code or else the

1502
01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.900
federal government would have started
[Music]

1503
01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:54.780
um
uh censoring them federally and so

1504
01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:57.420
America would have had to be a different
country for Hollywood to not have the

1505
01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:59.840
haze code

1506
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:11.460
I just can't have sex with people who
don't talk during wow you have no idea

1507
01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:14.600
about me then

1508
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:23.520
pushing me you told me to shut up before
it was pretty horny uh

1509
01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:30.420
James noise in porn's weird it's like
not I'm afraid I'll get caught but guys

1510
01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:34.280
the video to what

1511
01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.500
it'll be interesting to see what happens
to the Channel with a period of time off

1512
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:47.340
maybe an algorithmic reset might be
helpful honestly I think so that's what

1513
01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:51.540
we're hoping for
yeah well it's it's more so just there's

1514
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.380
no point in doing anything in the summer
because views drop precipitously in the

1515
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.860
summer our views have been dropping
precipitously anyway honestly if it

1516
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:02.639
wasn't for our patrons there would be no
new videos

1517
01:56:02.639 --> 01:56:06.540
um
so you know there's a link in the

1518
01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:09.600
description if you'd like to become a
patron

1519
01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:12.360
um
but yeah like the the views on YouTube

1520
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:16.920
have been dropping I don't there's many
suppose possible reasons for it I don't

1521
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.179
know what it is but like our most viewed
video is still the killing stalking

1522
01:56:21.179 --> 01:56:25.380
video and that came after a two-month
break yeah there were two months between

1523
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:29.340
the bill the wicked and hoping video on
the killing stalking video what I'm

1524
01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:33.600
hoping for is that as we produce videos
going forward they'll feel more special

1525
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.739
because we won't be churning them out so
frequently it'll give people a chance to

1526
01:56:37.739 --> 01:56:41.580
watch them again yeah yeah instead of
like every week seeing like oh there's a

1527
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.800
new video oh there's a new video oh
there's a new video

1528
01:56:47.699 --> 01:56:50.760
and there's probably going to be two
videos a month because I still have to

1529
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:54.300
finish the queer Hollywood history
series but I would like I think two

1530
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:58.860
videos a month is a good sort of uh goal
what I kind of suggested to you is doing

1531
01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:02.580
a you know the channel video like a
proper video essay and then having

1532
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:06.239
another video as a like a flex video so
it could be another it could be a

1533
01:57:06.239 --> 01:57:10.560
reactionary video it could be one of our
discussion videos but something that you

1534
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.260
know feels like it needs to be done that
can be done a little bit more on the

1535
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:17.460
cusp
if you two ever cosplayed Wicked and

1536
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:21.480
huckling we talked about it when we
first met

1537
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:25.800
um but I'm way too insecure to do any
Anaconda cosplay I I'm also too insecure

1538
01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.239
for that so
I think spacing will help because while

1539
01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:33.239
I love your stuff I have to pace myself
because they are serious informational

1540
01:57:33.239 --> 01:57:36.900
topics yeah we're also going to try and
do happier videos or at least more

1541
01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:41.820
upbeat videos like the two videos that
are coming for patrons this summer

1542
01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:45.900
two or three videos that are coming for
patrons this summer I forget how many

1543
01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:54.080
um they're much more upbeat topics than
you know everything sucks

1544
01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:58.980
although we've done happy videos in the
past and nobody watched them so we'll

1545
01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:03.659
act we'll see what happens again if it
wasn't for our our patrons we wouldn't

1546
01:58:03.659 --> 01:58:09.300
be able to
do this stuff uh able Knight we dab we

1547
01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:13.500
absolutely will see them in the Marvel
Universe uh but they're probably gonna

1548
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:17.099
suck like the rest of Marvel content
these days and either they're not gonna

1549
01:58:17.099 --> 01:58:21.739
kiss or you're gonna see them only on
Disney Plus

1550
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.560
which I'd be I think Young Avengers
would work better as a series I think so

1551
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.599
too but also the series generally suck
well that's what Disney like Disney's

1552
01:58:30.599 --> 01:58:34.260
kind of doing a reset now yeah and I
think they need to do that reset I need

1553
01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:39.560
to write my Scarlet Witch movie I didn't
try and get an Elizabeth Olsen's desk

1554
01:58:39.719 --> 01:58:45.980
here the Scarlet Witch Redemption Arc
begins now don't trust you

1555
01:58:46.099 --> 01:58:50.400
I think I think you need to intersperse
your happy and sad videos

1556
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:54.000
well if more happy stuff would happen it
would be we're gonna do more videos

1557
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:58.860
about anime which is like relatively
happier because anime's silly

1558
01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:03.360
the heart Supper video was happy and
nobody watched it yeah

1559
01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.260
I released that the weekend Heart
Stopper came out nobody watched it had a

1560
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:10.219
nervous breakdown for nothing

1561
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:15.960
what you don't remember that I was a
nervous wreck while we were making that

1562
01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:20.400
what do you mean I must have kept it
hidden from you I literally

1563
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:25.380
I wrote it yeah and then filmed it and
put it out on Sunday you didn't do

1564
01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:31.800
anything on that video I was there for
readings I helped you shoot it and

1565
01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:36.960
yeah I was kind of having a breakdown
why because it was triggering I guess

1566
01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:40.580
oh yes I remember new

1567
01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:48.300
okay when we say nobody watched the the
video we mean like it didn't pull the

1568
01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:52.080
views like it got more views than most
of our videos now get

1569
01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:55.739
I don't want to talk about it
our videos haven't been getting as many

1570
01:59:55.739 --> 02:00:00.659
views as a certain group of people came
at us in December

1571
02:00:00.659 --> 02:00:06.000
your anime videos do better it seems to
me especially like uh well anything we

1572
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:13.199
cover that's like Asian coverage like
man was anime they always do better than

1573
02:00:13.199 --> 02:00:18.179
the the other stuff
um obviously killing stalking painter of

1574
02:00:18.179 --> 02:00:22.199
the night the horror videos always do
pretty well except for last October's

1575
02:00:22.199 --> 02:00:24.840
video that one didn't do as well but I
think that's because there were like

1576
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:30.239
three videos in October so it didn't
really have a chance to take off

1577
02:00:30.239 --> 02:00:33.540
um
my husband and I are watching Moon girl

1578
02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:39.060
and devil dinosaur I've heard of moon
girl devil dinosaur review

1579
02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:43.219
yeah that's a Marvel thing I think

1580
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:49.739
Attack on Titan in the title foolproof
it sucks that I had to take the attack

1581
02:00:49.739 --> 02:00:52.739
on Titan video down and put it back up
because now it doesn't have as many

1582
02:00:52.739 --> 02:00:56.659
views and it doesn't look as impressive

1583
02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:12.420
every Crossover with other YouTubers
um I've done some like voiceovers for

1584
02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:16.440
other YouTubers but I haven't had anyone
else come on to do video like voiceovers

1585
02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:19.619
for me or anything like that
um

1586
02:01:19.619 --> 02:01:25.080
we don't really do any crossovers with
other YouTubers because it's we've like

1587
02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:30.360
to even to have someone come and do a
voice for one of our videos I edit so

1588
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:34.980
quickly that there isn't really time to
get them to like record it and

1589
02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:39.179
everything because like I'll start
editing on Monday and have the video

1590
02:01:39.179 --> 02:01:46.340
ready by Wednesday so there's not really
time to to wait around for someone else

1591
02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:52.320
uh that was all James and me we do all
the voice acting in the videos

1592
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.800
do more Rowling that always gets views
not the latest one the latest one didn't

1593
02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.800
do as well
uh in your latest video I think you had

1594
02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:05.219
some voice actors we didn't have voice
actors we just uh I took some uh

1595
02:02:05.219 --> 02:02:09.800
clips from a theatrical production of
Angels in America

1596
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:18.619
and uh so those are actually
um Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield

1597
02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.040
make a video of how gay anime is getting
uh we are actually going to do a video

1598
02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:37.199
like about how gay anime is and realize
there's there's a lot of this

1599
02:02:37.199 --> 02:02:44.639
um and so that's why you know there's
been a skate video a Banana Fish video

1600
02:02:44.639 --> 02:02:49.440
um
uh an attack on Titan video which had

1601
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.880
nothing to do with gayness oddly there's
gonna be a given video there's

1602
02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:58.739
um there was the number six video
um

1603
02:02:58.739 --> 02:03:03.780
instead of covering all the animes at
once they've kind of all made it into

1604
02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:06.560
their own videos

1605
02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:26.940
anime often implies gayness but doesn't
actually have the MLM or WLW happen

1606
02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:33.500
yeah although lately some some animes
have actually been going there

1607
02:03:41.219 --> 02:03:46.980
do your potential Partners need to know
a lot of movie Anime and sci-fi stuff no

1608
02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:52.159
like I joke that my ideal partner is a
boring lawyer

1609
02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:00.440
like it would be nice if they were a
nerd but if they weren't it's fine

1610
02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:11.940
I think the implying stuff is fairly
early 2000s anime I forgot about the

1611
02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.060
Yuri on Ice video it's been so long
since we did that one the director of

1612
02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:20.119
uriani seems to have had her career
destroyed despite her proven success

1613
02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:26.239
hmm there's a whole lot there about that

1614
02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:30.000
I get that impression too the nimona
seems to be either gender fluid or

1615
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.320
non-bone I haven't watched that yet

1616
02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:39.060
um Grand Master of demonic cultivation I
haven't read the novels and I haven't

1617
02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:42.360
watched the show but I'm reading the
comics that are being released and I'm

1618
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.940
really enjoying the comics but it's
going to be a while before I can do a

1619
02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:47.699
video on it
um

1620
02:04:47.699 --> 02:04:51.659
but uh there probably will be a video on
it

1621
02:04:51.659 --> 02:04:55.639
I can't I can't really say when though

1622
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.980
you good you want to cut it out for the
night I I think I'm good

1623
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:16.340
you sure yeah
man I wouldn't mind some ice cream

1624
02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.380
what what kind of ice cream

1625
02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:31.619
why was I about to type in Lime torrents
it's been a thing for ages I know and it

1626
02:05:31.619 --> 02:05:34.460
doesn't feed you

1627
02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:38.399
[Applause]

1628
02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:55.260

time when I and Nick were both moving at

1632
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:15.360
almost the exact same time yeah like
literally I think the day before I had

1633
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:21.000
my move schedule you locked down your
place and so it was like me unpacking

1634
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.260
for a week and then you moved and I was
not anticipating to get a place as

1635
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:28.280
quickly as I did yeah

1636
02:06:28.679 --> 02:06:33.420
ah
I mean I I've caught all the spoilers

1637
02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:36.360
that just makes me want to see it more I
don't know how they fit together I've

1638
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:40.619
somehow managed to avoid all the
spoilers somehow and like I am all for

1639
02:06:40.619 --> 02:06:47.400
rule 34 of miguelo Miguel O'Hara

King Latin names and their lack of

letters you do not pronounce those

02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:03.540

awful poornic sunburn no that's just

1647
02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:22.400
irritation oh

1648
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.280
have you seen the reactions to the idol
I've seen people basically say that it's

1649
02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:35.940
horrible but that's about it
that's the idol uh it's a new show from

1650
02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:39.659
the guy who made
um the that

1651
02:07:39.659 --> 02:07:47.460
um the the Zendaya show Euphoria
um and it's like just apparently really

1652
02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:49.760
bad

1653
02:07:56.699 --> 02:08:02.659

very good very good
I think I may also like some chicken

1657
02:08:18.239 --> 02:08:22.260
nuggets
scrolling up backup chat uh Jason you

1658
02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:25.619
said the director of Uranus seems to
have had her career destroyed despite

1659
02:08:25.619 --> 02:08:28.739
proven success like has it been a thing
like she hasn't been able to get work

1660
02:08:28.739 --> 02:08:32.460
since then
she kind of got blacklisted when she

1661
02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:36.780
tried to make the deal with Netflix
oh for going behind the craters yeah

1662
02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:41.300
well now the creators of going against
the studio

1663
02:08:42.179 --> 02:08:46.080
and Netflix didn't take the deal
uh it's not that they didn't take the

1664
02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:50.219
deal it's that she tried making the deal
just as the pandemic started uh so

1665
02:08:50.219 --> 02:08:55.020
timing was really bad
oh that sucks poor girl she did such a

1666
02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:57.320
good job

1667
02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.739
yeah I know she was the creator just
word didn't work properly

1668
02:09:01.739 --> 02:09:07.280
Telos will make a live-action Yuri on
Ice we'll do it

1669
02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:12.239
give us the money we'll do anything like
cinematic that way we are kidding

1670
02:09:12.239 --> 02:09:15.320
not we have standards

1671
02:09:19.619 --> 02:09:24.659
can I know where did you get the white
it's the it's angel wings it's not even

1672
02:09:24.659 --> 02:09:29.699
like uh it's the the thing that looks
apparently looks like Debbie is just

1673
02:09:29.699 --> 02:09:32.239
angel wings

1674
02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:41.340
urine ice was really good but sadly I
think it wasn't gay enough

1675
02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:46.260
it'd be hard to make you a nice cake the
entire argument I wanted to present in

1676
02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:49.800
the Yuri Noise video is like I don't
think it would have helped the story for

1677
02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.760
anyone to come out and look at the
camera and say I'm gay yeah like I think

1678
02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:57.900
that there's a point of media literacy
where we need to just accept that yes

1679
02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:01.440
they're gay and people saying that no
they're not do not have adequate media

1680
02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:05.540
literacy we did a whole video about it

1681
02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.920
you're all aware that in the 6-3 vote
world of businesses

1682
02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:21.139
oh yeah yeah we talked about the shitty
state of America

1683
02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:28.199
yeah Sarah yeah Sarah's right they had
matching rings yeah matching rings

1684
02:10:28.199 --> 02:10:34.139
matching friendship rings the only the
only straight person on that show was JJ

1685
02:10:34.139 --> 02:10:37.219
he's not straight

1686
02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:42.900
first of all he was what he he choked
because of he was thinking of a

1687
02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:47.780
Ukrainian ass not Ukrainian ass checking
us

1688
02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:52.739
he was busy thinking about Slavic ass so
he choked second of all French Canadian

1689
02:10:52.739 --> 02:10:58.159
like
it's a French Canadian

1690
02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.900
have you guys ever heard of the anime
Heavenly delusion it just came out and

1691
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:15.840
it kind of sort of has a trans character
in it I would love to see what you guys

1692
02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:20.179
think about that one I've never heard of
that one actually

1693
02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.619
The Exchange rings under a Barcelona
church with a choir in the background

1694
02:11:28.619 --> 02:11:34.139
like
the coding like that wasn't even coding

1695
02:11:34.139 --> 02:11:37.380
well that's what I mean like How Deeply
does something need to be coated before

1696
02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:40.440
it qualifies as representation I
honestly don't think that it would have

1697
02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.679
been like
why and this is my kind of critique

1698
02:11:43.679 --> 02:11:47.219
about like people clamoring for queer
representation why is it more important

1699
02:11:47.219 --> 02:11:51.960
to have the words I'm gay in there than
to actually have a genuine queer story

1700
02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:55.380
which is how we get instances of queer
representation where it just feels

1701
02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:58.980
shallow and unfulfilled because it's too
busy trying to be a que representation

1702
02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:03.420
than representing queer people yeah like
in Yuri on Ice you have several queer

1703
02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:08.040
characters obviously queer characters
who are showing that they have huge

1704
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:15.900
inferiority complexes around it you have
one with really bad body issues like who

1705
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:19.860
spent his entire career quite while
questioning gender like yeah like there

1706
02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:25.619
is so much queer stuff in Yuri on Ice
that here's my Victor Yuri on Ice uh

1707
02:12:25.619 --> 02:12:29.520
even if you got rid of the wedding like
the exchanging of rings and everything

1708
02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.360
it's and you've got yurio who was
abandoned by his family because he liked

1709
02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:38.159
Dancing Yeah
who rides for a monkey slob yeah

1710
02:12:38.159 --> 02:12:42.000
who you know the shares in common with
the older gay couple that you know the

1711
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.900
smaller one is the top

1712
02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:49.560
do you think Yuri's the top oh yes girl

1713
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:59.300
Have You Seen Her Yuri's based off of no
yes yeah you're so cute

1714
02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:05.940
they didn't confirm the relationship I
don't care about the I'm gay I want the

1715
02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:10.619
relationship to not just be vague enough
so women can say well I can make myself

1716
02:13:10.619 --> 02:13:14.940
insert with the gay character it doesn't
matter and like even if you

1717
02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:19.020
I'm gay in there they would still be
pushing back against it

1718
02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:26.520
um which they do yeah which they do
there are like there are fans of like

1719
02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:31.260
certain comics manwa and stuff like that
that are just like oh no they're not gay

1720
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:35.159
they're not gay it's a power thing
they're not actually in love with each

1721
02:13:35.159 --> 02:13:40.520
other it's just a you know a power thing
and it's like

1722
02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:45.780
it doesn't matter how coded or how
explicit it is there will be pushback

1723
02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:50.520
against that yeah and you don't need to
argue with that my advice to that is

1724
02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.360
just you know follow the Keanu Reeve
strategy when someone says two plus two

1725
02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.199
equals five hold your hand up and say
okay good luck with that

1726
02:13:58.199 --> 02:14:02.400
um
like no that didn't happen with killing

1727
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.880
stalking but that did happen with
painter of the night a lot of them were

1728
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:11.340
like is straight no that's like it's
that not somehow the um sungho is no

1729
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:15.239
that's song wo
right songhou is yeah yeah painter of

1730
02:14:15.239 --> 02:14:18.420
the night
um I got the pronunciation right for

1731
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:21.079
paper of the night

1732
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:30.420
I mean it was a meme about like in
Lincoln sit on for um uh they're in a

1733
02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:34.260
selfie and it's the mean like Link's
comment is oh my God we look like such a

1734
02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:39.860
couple and students kind of like a
couple of Besties see that yeah

1735
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:44.340
so yeah like um
I do I do empathize with you know

1736
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:48.480
wanting to have pushback against people
who are like no this is no these are

1737
02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:51.960
obvious straight characters it's like oh
I'm sorry they just don't have good

1738
02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:55.560
media literacy yeah it's like no amount
of you arguing is going to change that

1739
02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.679
because it's not based around logic it's
a bass run to Fantasy complex yeah

1740
02:14:58.679 --> 02:15:03.739
there's there's a point where people are
just detached from reality

1741
02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:14.420
like I don't recognize raylo when I saw
that kiss like you're correct like

1742
02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:18.780
uh episode nine like I hate people who
say that episode Done was terrible

1743
02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:24.719
because Ryan Johnson gave nothing to
work with after episode which that is a

1744
02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:29.699
lie
oh and like people say that oh I don't

1745
02:15:29.699 --> 02:15:32.460
like this movie because he set up railo
it's like he set up railo and then

1746
02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:36.960
dashed it in the same movie She closed
the door onto him

1747
02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.520
yeah like that's

1748
02:15:43.079 --> 02:15:47.400
well even if they are bi if they're in a
committed really committed MLM

1749
02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.219
relationship that shouldn't excuse the
fact that it's an ml in committed

1750
02:15:50.219 --> 02:15:53.820
relationship
yeah like it doesn't matter if they're

1751
02:15:53.820 --> 02:16:00.420
bisexual or they're gay
they exchanged Rings yeah

1752
02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:05.639
Victor jumped on him and kissed him
exchanged rings when someone pointed it

1753
02:16:05.639 --> 02:16:11.340
out at the table they all started they
all started fawning yeah and like oh

1754
02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:17.300
there we go and like when Victor like
leapt on him and kissed him on the ice

1755
02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:21.960
it's like
if it was just a hug the crowd would not

1756
02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:25.460
have Frozen the way they did

1757
02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:32.399
what about Laura Dern uh she died in
episode eight oh yeah

1758
02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:37.080
even though she was actually a queer
character as confirmed in like the it

1759
02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:41.639
was it was a wasted character I think
especially because like

1760
02:16:41.639 --> 02:16:46.019
yeah it was it was Star Wars trying to
play off of oh this is an interconnected

1761
02:16:46.019 --> 02:16:49.380
universe but this is a multimedia
Universe like no please stop doing that

1762
02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:52.740
I hate it when Final Fantasy does that
don't do it here at either

1763
02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:57.479
did you see no schnep in a pride he was
so happy oh so I'm glad I'm good before

1764
02:16:57.479 --> 02:17:02.460
him yes good for him
finally gets to stop getting answered

1765
02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:05.939
ask that question they better give him
superpowers in season five they better

1766
02:17:05.939 --> 02:17:08.359
give him a different haircuts in season
five

1767
02:17:08.359 --> 02:17:12.780
God damn it I feel like that's less
likely than the Superbook absolutely

1768
02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:15.800
less likely because he asked them and
they said no

1769
02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:20.340
surely this kid can scrape together ten
dollars for a haircut so his mom can

1770
02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:23.059
stop doing it

1771
02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.559
huh
yeah it is really common yeah anime

1772
02:17:28.559 --> 02:17:33.599
especially especially anything that's
not like romance anime like the kisses

1773
02:17:33.599 --> 02:17:36.679
are usually obscured

1774
02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:43.320
is it gay to mouth kiss your homies on
the skating rink

1775
02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:47.179
be gay
foreign

1776
02:17:51.359 --> 02:17:54.420
because like I know I mentioned about
this a lot in terms of like oh close

1777
02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:58.200
friendships or actually like like but we
also need to not run into the territory

1778
02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:01.620
where we're saying that any kind of
emotional intimacy between between two

1779
02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:07.139
men is automatically queer yeah because
you know he wanted D toxicify

1780
02:18:07.139 --> 02:18:11.880
masculinity dismantle patriarchy part of
that means that men need to be able to

1781
02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:15.840
feel emotions meet and be able to stress
emotions uh my mother who actually does

1782
02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:18.840
a lot of work with uh child and Youth
Development

1783
02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:23.939
uh she said Studies have kind of
indicated that out in a bubble like in

1784
02:18:23.939 --> 02:18:29.280
in a Cell in a sterile environment where
um children are raised with specific

1785
02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.139
studies in mind it's indicated that
young boys have more empathy than young

1786
02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:39.000
girls
really yeah uh there's generally more of

1787
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.660
an empathetic Drive in younger boys than
young girls

1788
02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:45.240
um
which you know you want to look at you

1789
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:48.960
know the mean dog group like look at
Dobermans look at pit bulls it's like

1790
02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:53.160
these are incredibly affectionate dogs
who are vicious things because it's

1791
02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:57.899
beaten out of them because there's
something sensitive about them that is

1792
02:18:57.899 --> 02:19:02.040
uh because they're so because they're so
sensitive it means they can turn vicious

1793
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.059
but you you know beat that out of them
yeah sometimes literally

1794
02:19:06.059 --> 02:19:09.660
it's like pitbulls one of the ways that
they train pitbulls to fight is actually

1795
02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:13.500
to get them really attached to something
and then throw that thing to the other

1796
02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:19.580
dog
because they need to go protect it yeah

1797
02:19:23.099 --> 02:19:26.399
good I saw up in the chat a little bit
then you went to your first prize you

1798
02:19:26.399 --> 02:19:30.599
know when I went on my street adventure
with my experimentation with public

1799
02:19:30.599 --> 02:19:34.679
transit yeah
um I was walking around Church Street

1800
02:19:34.679 --> 02:19:37.859
there was a guy sitting on the street
I'm assuming a homeless guy panhandling

1801
02:19:37.859 --> 02:19:40.880
he asked for a light
um

1802
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:45.780
I said no I don't have a light I'm sorry
he's like oh okay happy Pride I'm like

1803
02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:49.399
it's a holiday now that's really cool

1804
02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:57.420
I think my my camera's about to die oh
it's at five percent

1805
02:19:57.420 --> 02:20:02.120
mine was uh about ten percent higher
than yours

1806
02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.399
wait

1807
02:20:10.859 --> 02:20:15.740
sometimes even knew where was I

1808
02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:23.840
praise James camera

1809
02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:30.479
last it'll last about
two and a half hours which is better

1810
02:20:30.479 --> 02:20:35.880
than it has been in the recent times
when after like 10 minutes so how do we

1811
02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:39.300
get it again so that it can just go
indefinitely like you indefinitely like

1812
02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:42.780
you used to
um it all I have to do is go into the

1813
02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:47.340
settings and switch the thing to say
that it can be powered by USB okay

1814
02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:54.020
um because this thing doesn't have
Thunderbolt power

1815
02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:57.720
Thunderbolt yeah Thunderbolt it just has
USBC

1816
02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:00.540
so camera dying means we're gonna head
out

1817
02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:05.300
yeah I figure we can uh head out
probably around

1818
02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:08.399
[Music]
in about 10 minutes

1819
02:21:08.399 --> 02:21:11.880
and uh
the ice cream will probably be arriving

1820
02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:19.140
around then too and maybe James camera
do some splatting Splatoon

1821
02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:24.300
as our pleasure chicken nuggets it's
nice to be back I I've been distant for

1822
02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:29.340

distant somebody was asking me who I was

1823
02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:33.020

1824
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:40.740
see Nick doesn't hate you

02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:19.200
do you guys know a horror show that
Trixie and Katy reacted to brand new no

1832
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:23.040
I've never heard of that I haven't seen
uh I can't

1833
02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.939
the Trixie and Katie haven't been
reacting to things that I like know of

1834
02:22:26.939 --> 02:22:29.420
lately

1835
02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:34.560
except they reacted to I forget what the
show is called but it's like a lesbian

1836
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:37.859
dating show that was on Netflix that I
got really invested in not the show I

1837
02:22:37.859 --> 02:22:41.720
didn't watch the show but I got really
invested in their reaction to the show

1838
02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.319
sometimes that's funnier

1839
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:52.260
is the gay chat on Hiatus as well for
the summer no

1840
02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:55.260
um no what's the gay chat what we're
doing now

1841
02:22:55.260 --> 02:23:00.720
oh no we're gonna keep doing this yeah
yeah this this this isn't scripting and

1842
02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:05.280
because we want to take some time off
we're entertaining the idea of maybe

1843
02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:09.359
actually going on a vacation of some
sort

1844
02:23:09.359 --> 02:23:12.540
um we are going to do some videos for
patrons that are you know normal video

1845
02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:17.640
essays and they'll will come out later
on in the fall for normal YouTube

1846
02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:24.960
um they the ones there are
um for sure Sandman good Omens and

1847
02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:28.740
revolutionary girl lieutenant uh so
those will come out for patrons in the

1848
02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:34.380
summer and uh camp Camp yes and camp
camp and no disco disco Elysium will be

1849
02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:38.700
the fall yeah
um so there's gonna be stuff just for

1850
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:42.120
patrons during the summer
um

1851
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:48.720
and then uh it'll come out later on in
the fall for normal YouTube

1852
02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:53.760
which will be a good backstop if YouTube
is like you took a break you then

1853
02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:58.020
we can just start flooding it with
content and get back into its algorithms

1854
02:23:58.020 --> 02:24:02.700
good graces Fernando Felix thank you
very much and queer and autism and

1855
02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:05.220
neurodivergence in the queer Community
is something that I would like to speak

1856
02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:10.979
on in some kind of future video videos
because it's it's weird being there's a

1857
02:24:10.979 --> 02:24:15.720
dating show on Netflix not a dating show
but it's like a romantic comedy about

1858
02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:19.859
being on the Spectrum and dating as gay
person no oh is it I know there is

1859
02:24:19.859 --> 02:24:23.819
there's a show I think called on the
spectrum that is a dating show of people

1860
02:24:23.819 --> 02:24:28.500
on the Spectrum dating yeah it's weird
being with especially queer because

1861
02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:32.520
there are so many nuanced rules about
queerness and existing queer spaces so

1862
02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:39.060
yeah uh it's certainly been a challenge
have you ordered a Grimace shake from no

1863
02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:42.660
but I've exposed James to the meme Trend
to daily

1864
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:46.680
um I know people who have had it and
they're like it tastes like purple

1865
02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:52.560
um and so I'm like that sounds gross and
you know just like what is this a horror

1866
02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:58.439
Trend surrounding the Grimace Shake it's
the power of greatness there's gonna be

1867
02:24:58.439 --> 02:25:03.680
a friggin uh blumhouse movie about this
damn thing

1868
02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.040
I mean some of them are putting that
kind of quality yeah

1869
02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.840
yeah like how was she climbing on the
roof

1870
02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:21.420
my partner and I are both queer
autistics which makes things both easier

1871
02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:25.460
and harder yeah I can imagine yeah

1872
02:25:26.819 --> 02:25:31.979
James it tastes like Berry Tums or
Rolaids very fake and chalky oh that

1873
02:25:31.979 --> 02:25:37.200
sounds gross it sounds really gross
also today I learned of the Grimace

1874
02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:43.160
Shake Trend as well it's so funny
so weird

1875
02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:46.680
I mean the the Wonder I don't think
McDonald's thought this was gonna go

1876
02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:49.620
viral no no no no
um because every time this McDonald's

1877
02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:54.000
tries to do something viral specifically
it backfires and it's just cringe yeah

1878
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.260
um I like the one of that one lady who
the lady who made the Grimace Shake

1879
02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:02.760
herself like three scoops
cream like that looked like a good one

1880
02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:06.060
oh yeah that looked tasty yeah like that
ain't what McDonald's you've got

1881
02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:11.460
raspberry you got some raspberries you
got blueberries and that looks tasty

1882
02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:15.540
yeah blend it
it makes me laugh because it makes no

1883
02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.780
sense

1884
02:26:21.479 --> 02:26:25.020
it came up a while ago about Shaggy
being too powerful and like the spirit

1885
02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:30.420
of Shaggy possessing people like he was
only acting with one-fifth of his power

1886
02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:34.200
like
the Shamrock the Shamrock Shake is

1887
02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:38.220
pretty good though
I think I had the Shamrock Shake was

1888
02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:42.359
that that's mint mint yeah mint
[Music]

1889
02:26:42.359 --> 02:26:45.899
I I also missed the McDonald's
characters I think they were fun they

1890
02:26:45.899 --> 02:26:50.280
should all come back the little bird
girl was she a bird I don't remember I

1891
02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:54.660
just remember the hamburger bun hold and
burglar Grimace there was a girl I swear

1892
02:26:54.660 --> 02:26:58.319
they could Rebrand Ronald because he
kind of looks creepy the way he was but

1893
02:26:58.319 --> 02:27:04.920
like yeah they need to do something with
him can't visit pop to redesign him yes

1894
02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:13.620
because there's like
seats at McDonald's is where you can sit

1895
02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:16.819
next to Ronald and it's like I don't
want to sit there

1896
02:27:16.819 --> 02:27:21.540
I'm not even afraid of clowns but I'm
just like creeped out by these giant

1897
02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:27.140
plasticine
clowns staring off in the distance

1898
02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.399
you know that they should bring back the
burgers Burger King's Burger King kids

1899
02:27:32.399 --> 02:27:37.859
club
they were like it was basically like the

1900
02:27:37.859 --> 02:27:41.340
 Captain Planet kids
um

1901
02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:46.020
all different colors uh one of them was
in a wheelchair or like it was like that

1902
02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:50.220
but this was like in the early 90s why
am I out of focus because I'm not

1903
02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:54.479
centered because I'm dumb and I did the
things wrong next time I'll do them

1904
02:27:54.479 --> 02:28:01.939
right I love gen z i I do too I don't
know why people hate young people yeah

1905
02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:14.760
these generational divides are invented
the same thing was done to Gen X yeah

1906
02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.899
um like these are breakthrough cycle of
generational trauma

1907
02:28:18.899 --> 02:28:23.340
um for real these identified divides are
these days they're largely superficial

1908
02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:26.819
it was describing oh it was the Baby
Boomers and the baby the children the

1909
02:28:26.819 --> 02:28:31.380
generations the generations sorry

1910
02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:38.460
um
so like these generational divides are

1911
02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:41.880
largely just arbitrary and I think at
this point they're made to design

1912
02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:47.160
they're designed to pit us against each
other I saw so many articles basically

1913
02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.180
kind of comparing Millennials to uh
Generation Z in a way that was

1914
02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:55.080
unflattering to us and then was
unflattering to gen z

1915
02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:58.800
um and it it drove a lot of animosity
between those two groups of people and

1916
02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.060
there's a whole lot more going on with
our current state of living that should

1917
02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:07.920
unite us under a similar Direction than
there is how they Define us like okay

1918
02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.560
you got y'all like y'all ate um ate uh
ghost peppers and Tide Pods okay great

1919
02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:19.730
we had seen culture like okay cringe
exists in every generation it's fine

1920
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:23.129
[Music]

1921
02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:29.540
it's like yeah well you had a mullet so
[Music]

1922
02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:33.600
my classmates did a scene from angels in
America in an acting showcase at school

1923
02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:38.160
it was so good oh yeah it sounds awesome
it's hard to like when you have it's

1924
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:40.979
such a good script because like it's
hard not to let these characters just

1925
02:29:40.979 --> 02:29:44.460
take over like I've read that like I
have the book I've read the actual like

1926
02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:48.680
script and it it just it it's so good

1927
02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:53.340
I prefer the fashion trends in gen Z
Millennial fashion was constrict what is

1928
02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:57.540
Millennial fashion even uh my mom
 about this a lot it's a lot of

1929
02:29:57.540 --> 02:30:01.800
gray uh beige grayish
um there's a millennial gray looking

1930
02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:05.100
bathroom inside a Mexican restaurant uh
do you remember that song

1931
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:10.439
no oh it's a meme that I uh found and
tried to show it to everybody

1932
02:30:10.439 --> 02:30:12.560
um

1933
02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:19.020
yeah so it's just yeah there wasn't a
lot of color it was desaturated

1934
02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:23.880
the baggy clothing neutral colors I
remember in like junior high when I was

1935
02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:28.200
like 12 or 13. thing like when I got
when I was in high school it had

1936
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:32.160
switched to like skinny jeans and stuff
I like skinny jeans

1937
02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.700
um stretchy jeans specifically because
I've got you know wide hips and I you

1938
02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:42.500
know need need help with accommodating
how much but I have but then hips

1939
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:50.340
I mean comfortable for me now that I
don't have to like go to an office and

1940
02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:57.420
like put actual clothes on I just work
in my my gym shorts and a t-shirt

1941
02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:01.520
every day every day

1942
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.479
I think seems for your video essay on
renting angels in America thank you for

1943
02:31:06.479 --> 02:31:11.420
watching it Aaron
I really appreciate it

1944
02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:20.760
Gen X had a lot of existential dread
between nuclear war and AIDS yeah

1945
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:25.439
I mean Millennials had 911 and the war
on terror or nothing like these kind of

1946
02:31:25.439 --> 02:31:29.399
tragedies aren't really limited to us or
our generation and they're being

1947
02:31:29.399 --> 02:31:33.840
fabricated by a group of people who are
older than all of us and Rich yeah Rich

1948
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:37.439
yeah Rich old Pricks yeah

1949
02:31:37.439 --> 02:31:42.180
my legs are pretty thick oh I had an
idea for a way to make underwear gay

1950
02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:45.600
again
yes because Andrew Christian is kind of

1951
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:48.240
you know whatever straight people of
appropriate no straight men are wearing

1952
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:52.200
Andrew Christian I was like I need to
stand up to sort of demonstrate whenever

1953
02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:55.500
I take self pictures of my butt it's
like okay like I got underwear but it's

1954
02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:58.500
kind of flat off like that so what I do
is I normally hold the camera with one

1955
02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:01.380
hand and kind of pull up the crotch a
little bit to give myself a bit of a

1956
02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:06.479
crack like what if underwear had
drawstrings here that went down the

1957
02:32:06.479 --> 02:32:10.620
seams there so that you pull the
drawstrings it tightens up this so it

1958
02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:14.220
pulls it up to there you tie it off and
that way it gives you a round shaped

1959
02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:19.620
butt why don't you like
I'm not even joking here why don't you

1960
02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:27.000
like do that like
even a rough version and like

1961
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:32.640
you know see if you couldn't like
sell it because that that I would buy

1962
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:36.479
that because that would like you know
hug your butt and like pull in the

1963
02:32:36.479 --> 02:32:40.800
fabric into the you know the part the
pack a little bit and give you more of a

1964
02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:46.979
butt yeah yeah yeah rather than just a
unit cheek a unit cheek

1965
02:32:46.979 --> 02:32:49.580
ah

1966
02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:53.640
can you even have the Andrew Christian
ball pouch except not quite as dramatic

1967
02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:56.340
because then there's a giant chunk of
fabrics no I think we need to start

1968
02:32:56.340 --> 02:33:01.500
focusing on butts instead of ball juice
yes agreed because it's like oh wow I

1969
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:04.140
love the chat we're talking about butts
and like underwear and they're like oh

1970
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:07.140
boobers and oh my God this is terrible
like yeah without a cone in there

1971
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:11.220
somewhere
but yeah like make that kind of because

1972
02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:15.120
like jaws drop traps have also kind of
gone out I don't see them as much

1973
02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:19.319
so like I really only see them in porn
yeah so like

1974
02:33:19.319 --> 02:33:22.439
I generally think that like having
especially because like they're right

1975
02:33:22.439 --> 02:33:25.680
here you pull at it and then you tie
them off and then you get out of butt

1976
02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:30.780
yeah you gotta butt it's like a it's
like a butt bra yes yeah

1977
02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:35.320
yeah protect an adjustable protect lift
and separate

1978
02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:38.650
[Laughter]

1979
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.479
thank you chicken nuggets
you actually inspired me to order some

1980
02:33:48.479 --> 02:33:51.140
chicken nuggets

1981
02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:55.920
I think women's underwear has something
similar but with stretch fabric to shape

1982
02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:01.380
the butt well that's why the seam would
only go as far as like the the gooch the

1983
02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:04.680
potato I've heard it called a gooch no
it's take the taint it would only go to

1984
02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:07.200
the taint so like between your legs it
was going to be something very

1985
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:10.859
comfortable maybe a little bit higher
and you pull it and that way just put

1986
02:34:10.859 --> 02:34:13.680
crease tension on the fabric in the
middle

1987
02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:17.880
need to Workshop this a little bit what
if I could get Mo to try and design

1988
02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:20.780
early Concepts

1989
02:34:21.359 --> 02:34:25.979
yeah
I I legitimately am like it's a good

1990
02:34:25.979 --> 02:34:29.120
idea go for it

1991
02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:35.640
that's not a bad name for an underwear
brand so remember when I ordered those

1992
02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:41.359
underwear that have the butt pads
I don't but now I do

1993
02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:47.520
crap
I don't wear underwear but I want some

1994
02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:51.240
lace undies
I do have a thing for guys in lace

1995
02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:53.720
underwear

1996
02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:07.979
oh oh your camera's on battery exactly
exhausts bad

1997
02:35:07.979 --> 02:35:11.640
okay
James does have a butt but he thinks he

1998
02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:15.960
doesn't I don't have a butt because I
have back fat when the back fat is gone

1999
02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.859
I will have a butt because I have thighs
I have very thick thighs I'm starting to

2000
02:35:19.859 --> 02:35:25.920
notice a difference in a body since I
cut bread out yeah like on a 90 basis

2001
02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:29.520
but yeah
you can ever entirely

2002
02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:34.740
cut bread out carbs are in everything
yeah well bread you can like uh gluten

2003
02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:39.859
specifically but yeah like I have carb
free bread

2004
02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:45.240
but it's the gluten that's the problem
for me now again I'm wondering if the

2005
02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:51.439
food might not have
been maybe not okay no

2006
02:35:52.859 --> 02:35:58.859
James just stop here right here what
undress

2007
02:35:58.859 --> 02:36:02.040
have no butt maybe butt implants would
help

2008
02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:07.080
I don't know how carb free bread works
but you have to ask the scientists it

2009
02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:11.100
it's gross
unless you toast it if you toast it it

2010
02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:15.540
tastes just like normal toast but if you
just eat it as bread it's like

2011
02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:20.819
it has rubber it feels rubber I actually
had a cheat day and had some Red Lobster

2012
02:36:20.819 --> 02:36:25.160
cheddar biscuits today so yeah

2013
02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:30.899
can mostly go vegetarian but I can't cut
bread out

2014
02:36:30.899 --> 02:36:35.040
see I can't do vegetarian I like meat
too much I love bread so much at least

2015
02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:41.520
you froze on a flattering angle I think
yeah yeah yeah yeah not bad it's very uh

2016
02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.399
