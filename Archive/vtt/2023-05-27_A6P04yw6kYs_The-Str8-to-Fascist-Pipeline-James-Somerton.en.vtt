00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.879
This video is brought to you by SquareSpace.

2
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.480
Cabaret is a film that serves as a stark reminder
of how quietly a society can fall into fascism,

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.370
especially when those with privilege are willing
to turn a blind eye to atrocities taking place.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.310
Set in 1930s Berlin, the movie explores the
rise of the Naxi party and its impact on the

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.910
lives of ordinary people, particularly those
in the entertainment industry.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.150
The story follows the lives of a writer named
Brian and a cabaret performer named Sally

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.090
Bowles, who both become caught up in the political
turmoil of the time.

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.320
One of the key themes of Cabaret is the danger
of complacency in the face of fascism.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.399
The film portrays a society in which the majority
of people are either indifferent or actively

10
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.039
supportive of the Naxi party.

11
00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.399
This isn’t really shoved in the audience’s
face though, since the real plot revolves

12
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.180
around a bisexual love triangle.

13
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.500
It has Surprise Naxis, like The Sound of Music.

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.150
This willingness to ignore the third reich
is especially evident though in the character

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.149
of Max, a wealthy German Baron who is happy
to take advantage of the opportunities presented

16
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.170
by the Naxi regime, even as he turns a blind
eye to the horrors being committed by the

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.170
party.

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.650
Max's character serves as a reminder that
those with privilege often have the luxury

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.970
of ignoring the suffering of others, as long
as it does not directly affect them.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.150
The character of Sally Bowles also highlights
the dangers of complacency and privilege in

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.320
the face of fascism.

22
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.500
Sally is a talented performer who enjoys the
freedoms and opportunities that come with

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.869
life in Berlin's bohemian community.

24
00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.950
However, she is also naive and self-centered,
with little interest in politics or the world

25
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.710
outside her own narrow sphere.

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.720
As the Naxis begin to tighten their grip on
power, Sally remains oblivious to the danger,

27
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.740
choosing instead to focus on her own personal
ambitions.

28
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.450
It is only when she is directly confronted
with the realities of fascism that she begins

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.880
to understand the gravity of the situation,
and instead chooses to turn a blind eye…

30
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.000
Another key theme of Cabaret is the role of
propaganda in the rise of fascism.

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.710
The film shows how the Naxi party used performing
arts, specifically singing, to promote its

32
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.170
message and win over ordinary people.

33
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.611
This is most evident in the character of the
Emcee, the flamboyant and charismatic host

34
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.170
of the Kit Kat Klub.

35
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.280
While the Emcee initially seems like a harmless
figure, he gradually becomes more and more

36
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.360
sinister as the story progresses, using his
position to spread Naxi propaganda and sow

37
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
the seeds of hatred and intolerance.

38
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.640
Overall, Cabaret serves as a powerful warning
about the dangers of fascism and the ease

39
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.130
with which a society can fall into it, especially
when those with privilege are willing to turn

40
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.330
a blind eye to the suffering of others.

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.400
And one group that is historically brilliant
at pretending bad things aren’t happening,

42
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.610
or only happen to them, is straight people.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.290
The thing is.

64
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.420
We grew up hearing ‘Naxis are bad.’

65
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.759
This wasn’t really a shock to any of us.

66
00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.760
In fact, late night cartoons and even spoof
movies made a punchline out of somehow making

67
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.780
the villain of the story some random group
of Naxis.

68
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.780
And Indiana Jones.

69
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.110
It was a for-granted indication that no matter
what violence this group of villains endured,

70
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.169
parents groups would consider it ‘safe.’

71
00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.169
Because they were Naxis.

72
00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.789
We knew what the Naxis stood for and stood
against.

73
00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.560
That truth and justice heroically stood against
Naxi bigotry and intolerance — again, something

74
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.100
easily made into a punchile.

75
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.600
Fruity Hixler also wasn’t out of the cultural
awareness either.

76
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.389
So given that the culture was aware of what
made the Naxis bad, how are we watching a

77
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.569
certain group of people slip into that cultural
mindset of fascistic intolerance all over

78
00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:53.569
again?

79
00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.660
How is it so easy for certain groups of people
to blame immigrants, ethnic or religious minorities,

80
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.390
queer people, or even women for all the problems
in the world — instead of holding their

81
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.130
leadership and government institutions accountable?

82
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.460
It’s not even enough to say ‘this keeps
happening’ and, instead, more accurate to

83
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.389
say: this won’t stop happening.

84
00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.780
Why is it so easy for straight, white, cisgener,
(usually) men to slip into this kind of militant

85
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.030
bigotry like we see in Cabaret, and like we
see beginning to play out today.

86
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.430
And in spite of a large chorus of our society
claiming that we don’t have anything to

87
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.210
worry about, nearly everyone who lived through
things like the events in Cabaret are pointing

88
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.280
out the red flags.

89
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.960
It’s hard to plot out the dance steps to
the organized, violent xenophobia — often

90
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.740
because it’s not usually deliberate.

91
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.599
It’s a reaction to present events that take
different forms.

92
00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.460
Sometimes there’s financial hardship, other
times not.

93
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.760
Sometimes there’s a new ethnic group entering
the state, other times the ethnic group is

94
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.150
well established.

95
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.290
Sometimes there’s a political counter-movement,
other times not.

96
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.180
Two things seem to be constant in this pattern.

97
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.660
The first is that there is a perceived threat
to the hegemonistic way of life.

98
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.759
The second, is that figureheads arise who
point out that things were better before and

99
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.199
that they’re worse now because of a specific
reason.

100
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.780
That reason is… almost always a group of
people that they don’t like.

101
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.840
A later stage of this process involves the
leadership of this group insisting that to

102
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.710
make things go back to what they were, they
just need to… get rid of the thing that’s

103
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.710
different.

104
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.710
Or rather…

105
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.060
the thing they perceive as being different.

106
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.690
There’s a lot of writing about fascist regimes,
how to spot them developing, or spotting patterns

107
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.820
in their ideological belief systems.

108
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.650
But what it boils down to… seems to be a
matter of what they perceive, and how they

109
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.409
chose to trust their perception over all else.

110
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.389
And the easiest way to explain this is with
cake.

111
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.160
If you don’t have any cake, are you going
to get upset that you don’t have any other

112
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
cake?

113
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Generally not, no.

114
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.069
You may get some cravings now and then, but
these are spontaneous.

115
00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.560
Usually, you have to be reminded that cake
exists to really want it.

116
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.310
In which case, getting a spontaneous reminder
about cake — when you have a medical condition

117
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.350
that makes your body allergic to carbohydrates
— kinda sucks.

118
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.780
But cake was never an expectation in the first
place so it blows over.

119
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.910
However, if someone promises you cake as a
reward for, say, a series of rigorous and

120
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.720
perhaps deadly scientific experiments…

121
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.539
you’re going to get really excited about
the cake!

122
00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:31.409
And even though you did not have the cake
before, if the cake was a lie, you’re going

123
00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:34.110
to feel like the cake was taken away from
you.

124
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.289
Now the tricky part about this class of baby
fascists is that, even though cake was never

125
00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.130
an option, they perceive a promise of cake.

126
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.219
Cake which they would have never received
and never will receive.

127
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.600
So they are angry.

128
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.010
And while anger can be a potent and necessary
motivational tool, if you spend too long being

129
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:57.670
angry — getting what you want isn’t going
to make you feel better — you just want

130
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.519
to have your anger justified.

131
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:02.360
You want permission to be angry.

132
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.070
Now in this analogy, the cake is an applicable
symbol.

133
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.430
It can be sex, status, money, opportunities,
rights, freedom — the ability to harass

134
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.649
people without repercussions.

135
00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:15.970
Those are things though; the underlying motivation
seems to be a need to be able to have influence

136
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.180
over the world.

137
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.600
For whatever manifestation it may take — cake
is influence.

138
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.360
And privilege is qualified by any kind of
social expectation that you will get it.

139
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360
So.

140
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.530
As much as you may have felt that you were
promised cake, but do not have any cake, you

141
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.450
feel like there is an injustice.

142
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.510
However, if you see that others have cake,
you may begin to feel covetous.

143
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.660
Hannibal Lecter: “He Covets.”

144
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.070
You may be very inclined to feel that these
people who have cake are a threat to your

145
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.600
ability to have cake.

146
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.161
A key component of this anger is the fear
and outrage of a perceived victimhood, which

147
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:54.340
offers a sense of righteousness when taking
steps to righting a perceived wrong.

148
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.940
And this is where the metaphor unravels and
we can actually start talking about the real

149
00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.940
thing.

150
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.170
Because modern manifestations of fascism organize
around a particular kind of propaganda.

151
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.750
It begins with two perceptions: that there
is not enough cake to go around, and that

152
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.610
the reason you do not have cake is because
someone else has yours.

153
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.090
Both of these premises are false.

154
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.000
First: there is always enough cake to go around
— if there isn’t, it’s due to the actions

155
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.680
of an elite class who hoard the cake.

156
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.420
And they think they’re safe hoarding it
because we’ve let them believe that they

157
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.860
are immune to diabetes.

158
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.769
Second: the blame for ‘who has all the cake’
is deflected from who is actually causing

159
00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:37.040
the problem by scapegoating a group of people
who have few methods of legal protection.

160
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.120
It’s the language of privilege that makes
it difficult to really understand why it seems

161
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.530
so easy for fascism to recruit from the privileged.

162
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.680
Especially when, within their own propaganda,
there is a paradox about privilege itself.

163
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.870
On one hand, privilege doesn’t exist.

164
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.880
They hold up a handful of examples — to
the Naxis, it was Jewish Bankers.

165
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.430
In our culture, dissident, angry, white people
are directed towards people of color.

166
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.500
How can ‘white privilege’ exist when individual
white people have it worse off than Oprah?

167
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:11.330
They cite various scholarships programs, or
laws designed to afford opportunities to women

168
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.630
and people of color.

169
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.690
And they hold up these instances and say:
“there’s no assistance for straight white

170
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.370
men, therefore these ‘supposed minorities’
have privileges we do not have.”

171
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.370
To them?

172
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.829
Case CLOSED on racism, sexism, or homophobia.

173
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:31.649
Nevermind that these opportunities are in
place to offset a society which still to this

174
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.010
day favors straight white cisgender men.

175
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.550
However, on the other side of this paradox
is the insistence that having privilege SHOULD

176
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:44.130
afford those who have it with a greater amount
of the influence that they seek.

177
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.160
What’s the point of having privilege if
you don’t have opportunities to use it?

178
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.940
The language of entitlement and expectations
are used to establish a sense of what life

179
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.070
should be like for this group of people.

180
00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.010
This often calls back to periods of time in
national history where this demographic of

181
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.750
people enjoyed a great amount of cultural
influence.

182
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.480
Privilege doesnot exist when they need to
describe the normative condition of how their

183
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.360
lives OUGHT to look.

184
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.980
Privilege does NOT exist when they need to
frame their social victimization to justify

185
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.230
the fervor around their outrage for not having
the cake that their non-privilege should afford

186
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.230
them.

187
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.230
This is dumb.

188
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.230
Like.

189
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.050
It’s so incredibly dumb that you wonder
how people who engage in this discussion can’t

190
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.050
point it out.

191
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.850
How can xenophobic, exclusionary movements
of totalitarian control over a population

192
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.699
resulting in genocide and ethnic cleansing
that have shaped human history be rooted in

193
00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:39.610
this kind of errant, egregious dumbness?

194
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.980
Well, to quote Voltaire…

195
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:50.470
“anything too stupid to be said… is sung.”

196
00:12:50.470 --> 00:13:02.080
(“Tomorrow Belongs To Me”)

197
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.850
A regularly-documented aspect of fascism is
the degree to which pageantry is used to…

198
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.959
normalize it.

199
00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:09.720
And Make a spectacle of it.

200
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.110
Somehow it accomplishes both of these things.

201
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.750
Spectacle makes it seem fun and inviting,
while at the same time a regular performance

202
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:22.329
of fascistic showmanship makes it seem like
something that is socially acceptable to participate

203
00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:23.329
in.

204
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:25.279
The “well, if everyone’s doing it” mentality.

205
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:29.699
There’s a much more sinister side to this
than just offering up some comedic levity.

206
00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:33.930
In queer circles, we speak to the importance
of using representation in media to normalize

207
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.120
queer identities.

208
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.800
Not everyone is going to grow up knowing the
many different kinds of queer people out there.

209
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.980
By having these characters and their experiences
represented in media, it can establish a sense

210
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.290
of familiarity.

211
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:51.839
However, the use of pageantry can be used
against minority groups.

212
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:56.619
While the initial spark of injustice seems
to be required to rally these groups together

213
00:13:56.619 --> 00:14:02.639
— economic problems or what have you — these
actual causes begin to matter ‘less’ than

214
00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:06.839
having open permission to be hateful and bigoted
without social recourse.

215
00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:11.910
In early-stages of rallying around hate, certain
rhetoric is passed around within the hate

216
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.910
group.

217
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.209
When it was still in the beer halls, early
Naxis targeted Jewish Bankers, and held them

218
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:23.220
up as an instance of the kind of greed that
was keeping “pure Germans” from their

219
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.300
full potential.

220
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.410
(Whatever that means — because Hixler was
actually Austrian…)

221
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.829
And sure, there were probably some bankers
who were Jewish that were making life rough.

222
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:37.009
But there were also a lot of non-Jewish bankers;
and maybe the shitty shared quality was the

223
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.470
‘banker’ part, and not the Jewish part.

224
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.660
Some things never change.

225
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.839
However the rhetoric circulating in these
hate groups said that because Jewish bankers

226
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:46.610
were bad, that all Jewish people must have
been bad.

227
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.160
Enough time spent marinating in this echo
chamber, the less these qualities actually

228
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.949
applied to Jews of a particular profession,
and the more it was accepted — among the

229
00:14:55.949 --> 00:15:01.000
early Naxis and their supporters — that
these are just self-evident truths, for which

230
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.810
no explanation or justification was required.

231
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:08.930
The initial rationality behind the hatred
was removed; ongoing persecution required

232
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.500
no justification, and became a matter of begging
the question.

233
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:18.050
They deserve persecution so they must be bad;
they are bad because we know they are; they

234
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.690
deserve persecution because they are bad.

235
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:26.620
The transition from ‘spreading awareness’
about a class of perceived “undesirables”

236
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.370
begins with this abandonment of reason.

237
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.500
They literally abandon reasons for why they
should persecute this class.

238
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.589
The hallmark here is the comfort with which
they begin to justify the ridicule of this

239
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:39.589
group.

240
00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:43.889
Raising an alarm against some kind of threat
to privilege, children, or the moral fiber

241
00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:47.680
of society — these are good for calling
people to action.

242
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.780
There is a threat, some righteous cause to
fight for.

243
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.980
But that’s not enough: you have to make
the people comfortable with hatred.

244
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.190
Hatred can’t feel like hatred or people
may reject it.

245
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.540
Hatred has to feel ‘normal’ to be publicly
and personally acceptable… which is where

246
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.089
comedy comes in.

247
00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:08.110
Good evening, Achmed.

248
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.459
Good evening.

249
00:16:09.459 --> 00:16:10.459
(Laughter)

250
00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:13.110
Comedy is an incredibly complex human interaction.

251
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.220
It’s often considered a cheap thrill by
theatrical standards, we consider it an easy

252
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.930
form of entertainment when it comes to fart
jokes or slapstick.

253
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.899
However, comedies that engage audiences on
an intellectual level — such as TV shows

254
00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:29.149
like Veep or Arrested Development — are
often looped in with those base-level entertainments

255
00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.220
on merits alone.

256
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.110
Whether or not it’s easy to make someone
laugh (and for the fact that some people make

257
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:39.339
it look a lot easier than it is), that should
not dismiss the complex neurological process

258
00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.300
of comedy.

259
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.980
As much as we may dismiss comedy as lesser-than
media, there is no specific part of the brain

260
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.420
that is specifically responsible for laughter.

261
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.000
This results in a range of neurological, psychological,
and philosophical debate about why we laugh.

262
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.300
However, especially when philosophers are
concerned, they all seem to hold a common

263
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.880
element of linking laughter to both danger,
and social connections, even if they disagree

264
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.280
on how these elements result in laughing.

265
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.490
Suffice to say, laughter seems to be seen
as the result of a pleasant reaction or resolution

266
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.490
of tension.

267
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.430
That’s why we laugh after jump scares in
horror movies.

268
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.850
A joke is seen as a kind of psychological
maze for which the punchline is an escape:

269
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.660
the relief to the tension of anticipation
results in laughter.

270
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.850
This is compounded in social situations where
we crave connection to other people more than

271
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.260
we crave a satisfying outcome to the maze.

272
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.850
Definitely explains why you may watch some
comedians, and from the comfort of your couch

273
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.990
they seem to be bombing, though the crowd
seems to be laughing themselves to death.

274
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.160
Also why they add a laugh track to sitcoms
even when nothing is funny.

275
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.990
The joint connection itself is a relief, and
a formative element of a positive memory.

276
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:52.130
This element of social connection can be very
beguiling, as often documented by film critics.

277
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.630
At movie premieres, it’s more than just
screening the movie.

278
00:17:54.630 --> 00:18:00.610
There’s food, drinks, entertainment, mingling
— these things foster a good memory before

279
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.530
the movie even starts.

280
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.929
Many people at movie premieres will remark
that the screening itself was fantastic — only

281
00:18:06.929 --> 00:18:12.770
to later watch the movie without the rose-tinted
glasses and realize that it wasn’t very

282
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.770
good actually.

283
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.130
I’m sure it isn’t hard to see how this
applies to the spread of bigoted propaganda.

284
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.510
And this is one of the most concerning turning
points in Cabaret.

285
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.730
The host sings a loving ballad about his beloved,
regarding the discrimination this gorilla

286
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:32.150
faces, and how he doesn’t care at all about
how she looks or her feral habits.

287
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:37.299
This number is cute and light, and very earnest
— and the audience naturally laughs because

288
00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:39.620
it’s so absurd.

289
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.780
The film’s audience, in contrast to the
cabaret’s audience in the early 30s who

290
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.480
don’t know what’s around the corner for
Germany, is tricked into being tickled by

291
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.930
this warm comedic number.

292
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.710
The shock comes with the final line of the
number…

293
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.770
MC: “She wouldn’t look Jewish at all.”

294
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.080
Big ooof indeed.

295
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.820
To the in-universe audience, this is just
a joke.

296
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.179
And people who are offended at the establishment
using its platform and production to play

297
00:19:08.179 --> 00:19:12.840
into existing stereotypes “just need to
learn to take a joke.”

298
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.200
The combination of being lulled into a sense
of groupthink through joint participation

299
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.530
in a joke, regardless of quality, in conjunction
with the familiarizing act of a joke’s role

300
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.770
in presenting a sense of relief and comfort
— it’s no surprise that this is yet another

301
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.890
tactic in fascistic pipelines.

302
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:34.780
Hook people in with the threat, familiarize
them with comedic theatrics, and install a

303
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.059
sense of pride through pageantry.

304
00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.190
The Naxis specifically came at the public
through a two-pronged approach.

305
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:46.400
Although he was nothing but a lowly paper
hanger, Hixler had a knack for spotting world-class

306
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.360
talent and giving them an unbridled platform,
changing the course of art history.

307
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.280
But on the other hand, for the working class,
his cabinet empowered ‘base’ entertainers

308
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.900
— comedians, thespians, singers, and, yes,
the proprietors of clubs and cabarets.

309
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.000
Which… is another unfortunate parallel we
see expanding before our very eyes today.

310
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.190
It really shouldn’t come as a surprise to
me that there are a slew of stand-up comedians

311
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.480
who are explicitly going out of their way
to target trans people.

312
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:23.590
As a culture, we really ought to use it as
a litmus test about who, in the profession,

313
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.049
actually goes out of their way to make original
content.

314
00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:29.620
Going after minorities or small communities
is a low-hanging fruit.

315
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.270
It doesn’t take a whole lot of talent to
point to something different and say:

316
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.270
“Boy.

317
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.610
You’ve heard about this thing.

318
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.950
The people who do this thing.

319
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.820
It’s different, isn’t it?”

320
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.820
[Laugh track]

321
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.159
“Like reaaaaaaaly different…”

322
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.570
[Laugh track — light.]

323
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.560
“Anyone… uh… anyone notice this?

324
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.830
It’s different right?”

325
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.520
[Laugh track — audience agrees.]

326
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.380
“It’s so different — it’s completely
outside the accepted norm of established socio-political

327
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.720
influence and authority.

328
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720
[Laugh track]

329
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.480
It’s like we live our normal lives, and
we don’t even THINK about this, but these

330
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.419
people LIVE like this, right?

331
00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:09.580
They ACTUALLY do the thing that we accept
as different without observing cultural or

332
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.680
historic context!”

333
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.340
[Laugh track — heavy.]

334
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.360
“And we’re just gonna assume OUR way of
doing things is the objectively correct way

335
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360
to do things.

336
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.930
So we can just all agree that it's different.”

337
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.570
[Laugh track and clapping.]

338
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.860
[Pause] “Racial and/or ethnic slur.”

339
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.180
[Thunderous applause.]

340
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180
“RIGHT???”

341
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.330
Though these days comedians don’t even bother
discussing anti-trans hate in their stand-up.

342
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.799
It’s pretty much just a bigoted tirade that
the audience howls at because the culture

343
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:43.880
has conditioned them to believe that being
told not to hate people is synonymous with

344
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880
oppression.

345
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.190
Meanwhile, the stand up comedians playing
into this static, snapshot of culture are

346
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.950
the same ones claiming that the public holding
them accountable for saying hateful things

347
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.950
is an infringement on their freedom.

348
00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.861
Which says a whole lot more than I think they
mean to because if you have freedom, and you

349
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:08.140
use it to choose hatred, you need to consider
that hatred isn’t exactly the gateway drug

350
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.230
for more freedom.

351
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.630
Many stand up comedians like to talk themselves
up as having this philosophically esoteric

352
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.679
role to the culture as being the first and
last line of defense for freedom of speech.

353
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:25.170
Ignoring the flood of reporters and now even
elected representatives who are censored and

354
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.170
silenced.

355
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.440
But… but… without stand-up comedians,
society would never be able to push boundaries.

356
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.520
The role of stand-up comedy is to make people
uncomfortable when a society gets too comfortable

357
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.179
with its own status quo… or something along
those lines.

358
00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:42.680
And then they turn RIGHT around to complain
about why they can’t use comedy to target

359
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.280
minorities anymore.

360
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.940
You know.

361
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.360
The people who are pushed outside the fringes
of social acceptance.

362
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.840
I think in a lot of ways stand-up comedians
are jealous of people who belong to these

363
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840
minority groups.

364
00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.580
(And I do hate using the term minorities,
but bear with me.)

365
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:06.929
They long to exist as these fringe rockstars
who push boundaries, meanwhile people outside

366
00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:11.630
the straight, cis, white hegemony do that
just by existing.

367
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.556
The Penguin: You’re just jealous because
I’m a genuine freak — and you have to

368
00:23:15.556 --> 00:23:16.640
wear a mask!

369
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.539
Batman: You might be right.

370
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.800
No, that isn’t the last time I’m going
to use that clip.

371
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.730
Not to disrespect stand-up as an art.

372
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.090
Lewis Black, Kathy Griffin, the late great
Robin Williams, and George Carlin.

373
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.430
And now Hannah Gadsby.

374
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:36.429
Funny as hell, and they don’t attack people
in need of help.

375
00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:37.850
They punched up.

376
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.700
The targets of their comedy were either self-directed,
individuals or institutions who do have a

377
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:47.240
large amount of influence, or social trends
among the hegemony as a whole.

378
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.890
Targeting trans people, or other minorities,
accomplishes a process of othering these people

379
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.020
by highlighting their differences as different
from the norm.

380
00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:01.250
The aforementioned comedians who I feel are
worthy of respect, instead, often target the

381
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.780
INSTITUTIONS that propagate this ‘othering.’

382
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.330
On top of the great difficulty that it takes
to make these acts entertaining, there is

383
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:14.100
a great deal of power that this kind of charisma
holds.

384
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.789
Crowds of people may be easily swayed by a
charismatic figure.

385
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:22.820
And such a figure who seems so comfortable
with their subject material that it can be

386
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.130
passed to a crowd as common sense.

387
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:32.929
Through framing and context, the masses agree
that because this person on a stage is making

388
00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:36.010
a joke out of it, that it must be true.

389
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.419
And if one thing they say is true, everything
they say must come from that self-evident

390
00:24:41.419 --> 00:24:42.419
context.

391
00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:46.380
What is said doesn’t need to be true — but
if it is spoken with enough confidence, people

392
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.100
will believe that its true.

393
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:54.169
And the primary component of telling a joke
is that it’s only funny if you say it with

394
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:55.169
confidence.

395
00:24:55.169 --> 00:24:56.909
Marlin:
there's a mollusk, see?

396
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:58.570
And he walks up to a sea...

397
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.409
Well, he doesn't walk up, he swims up.

398
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:04.409
Well, actually, the mollusk isn't moving,
he's in one place.

399
00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:05.720
And then the sea cucumber-

400
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.720
A famous quote by Bertrand Russell — and
I apologize if he’s problematic, he’s

401
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720
been dead for fifty years.

402
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.399
But the quote, which remains exceptionally
poingnet, goes:

403
00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:20.100
“The whole problem with the world is fools
and fanatics are always so certain of themselves,

404
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.470
and wiser people are so full of doubts.”

405
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.870
This harmonizes with Socrates' famous line:

406
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.320
“The only thing I know is that I know nothing.”

407
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.690
Or Albert Einstein’s: “Common sense is
nothing more than a deposit of prejudices

408
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.860
laid down in the mind before age eighteen.”

409
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.919
The more we learn, the more knowledge we realize
we do not possess.

410
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:45.190
The more we may be informed that previously-held
beliefs are false, and the less we may trust

411
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.190
new information.

412
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.940
But this is the tricky thing about doubt…
you have to know what to place it in, and

413
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.059
how to do it.

414
00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:56.050
Doubt, like any other intelligence, is a skill.

415
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.380
How do you know what should be questioned
and what should be taken for granted?

416
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:05.210
If you apply this skill wrongly, you may offer
up sympathy for the devil.

417
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:14.710
“Money Makes the World Go Around”
“The world go around.

418
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.610
The world-”

419
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:22.750
We’re entering a period of time where an
inordinate amount of narrative effort in fiction

420
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.140
is driven by a need to deconstruct someone’s
rationale for WHY they’re villains.

421
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.520
I mean we really shouldn’t need a whole
lot of explanation to understand why that’s

422
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.929
probably a problematic element of society
today.

423
00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:39.169
In the instance of someone being a total dickwad,
an empathetic society would rather support

424
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:42.520
the victim than focus on the perpetrator in
question.

425
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.659
Granted, our culture has this fixation on
victim blaming.

426
00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:49.420
As if someone is asking to get burgled if
they have their valuables in a jewelry box

427
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.140
instead of a safety deposit box.

428
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.700
Cut to the: “well what was she wearing?”

429
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.700
argument.

430
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.130
Of course, empathizing with victims in a pragmatic
way would result in making changes to core

431
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.120
elements of society that generate these crimes
or aggressions in the first place and we’re

432
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120
allergic to that.

433
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.480
There’s a mindset that, if we interview,
analyze, and reason with individuals within

434
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:16.370
fascism — those who even 20 years ago would
have been easily considered villains, yet

435
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.760
saying that today somehow makes it ‘political’
— that if we get inside their head we can

436
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.049
figure out what makes them tick.

437
00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:24.580
That it’s important to understand WHY they’re
fascist.

438
00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.350
What elements of the culture are feeding into
this?

439
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.350
Which…

440
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.970
first… yeah we’ve been doing that but
at the same time I’m not seeing a whole

441
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:37.840
lot of administrative directives aimed at
redirecting people away from fascist pipelines.

442
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.299
This is what people have been screaming at
Facebook, Twitter, Tumbler, and even YouTube

443
00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:42.940
to do for ages.

444
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:50.640
And failing that, with business lords citing
freedom of… the market… or whatever — we

445
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.419
looked to our democratic leaders to oppose
an indoctrinating political system whose sole

446
00:27:55.419 --> 00:28:00.880
purpose is to usurp democracy and we continually
get a big ol’ ‘meh.’

447
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.960
The ending result of this is an after-school
special about bullying.

448
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.440
A lot of TV shows had one.

449
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.159
The main characters are getting horribly bullied,
and they get mad at their bully for bullying

450
00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:15.130
them, so they concoct some revenge scheme,
and then they learn that their bully was actually

451
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.271
bullied themselves, and then they feel bad
and apologize for their revenge, and their

452
00:28:20.271 --> 00:28:23.450
bully is never held accountable for being
an absolute dick!

453
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.830
I’m not outing myself as a Broney.

454
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.590
My co-writer had a stoner phase and was held
at gunpoint to binge a lot of kids shows.

455
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.020
This particular episode is shitty because
it sets a precedent for ignoring wrongs against

456
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.679
you, in lieu of empathizing with the people
wronging you.

457
00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:40.350
This is formative children’s media…

458
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.039
Why is it fostering a sense of martyrdom?

459
00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:49.019
Sure friendship and cooperation are great,
but when it comes to this friendship-vibes-only,

460
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:53.779
how much are you supposed to endure before
you stand up for yourself?

461
00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:57.169
And this is compounded through a collection
of modern animated films.

462
00:28:57.169 --> 00:29:01.000
Dreamworks’ The Bad Guys itself was a movie
focusing exclusively on this.

463
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.260
With the added twist of the surprise villain
(Which is now a staple of Disney too)… who

464
00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.679
you could spot the second he was on screen.

465
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:12.399
But still, the primary discussion of that
film was “Let’s talk about WHY the bad

466
00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.399
guys are bad.”

467
00:29:13.399 --> 00:29:19.020
Meanwhile: the only thing I want to talk about
was why are only the main characters furries?

468
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.380
Couldn’t they throw in an anthro or two
in the background?

469
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.890
While I thought it was a decent animated movie,
the conclusion the film comes to is that people

470
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.770
are ‘bad’ because that’s how they’re
treated their whole lives.

471
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:36.390
Which may or may not be true, but the script
does outstandingly little to outline what

472
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:42.409
‘bad’ means, when I feel that there — on
a societal level — needs to be a much more

473
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:45.260
nuanced understanding of badness.

474
00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.149
People committing petty crimes are ‘bad’
because they’re locked in a cycle of poverty

475
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:55.260
and this is how they have been conditioned
to think is an acceptable way to make ends

476
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.260
meet.

477
00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.750
While the depiction of carnivores in Bad Guys
establishes this on a visual level, there’s

478
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.490
little done to explore this nuance, or offer
any kind of resolution to the problem.

479
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.380
In fact, by the end of the movie, there is
no social prerogative for society to change

480
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.179
its perspective on visual profiling.

481
00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:17.559
The only social development is that the population
learns that you can’t trust furries.

482
00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:18.559
Any of them.

483
00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:23.419
The audience is meant to take away the real
messaging of course, to not judge a book by

484
00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:24.419
its cover.

485
00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:25.419
Give the ‘bad guys’ a chance.

486
00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:30.809
But it does very little to establish different
treatments for different kinds of badness.

487
00:30:30.809 --> 00:30:35.070
The only form of ‘badness’ it demonstrates
is robbery, and even then the only real difference

488
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.649
between the hamster and the wolf is how much
we are implored to empathize with their emotional

489
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:40.649
arc.

490
00:30:40.649 --> 00:30:45.210
How are we to separate the people who are
bad without the opportunities to be good,

491
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.169
and people who are just bad?

492
00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:51.720
And provided enough emotional context, are
we being conditioned to believe that everyone

493
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.440
can be good given the opportunity?

494
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.750
Are we really meant to take away that there
are no villains, only people you haven’t

495
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.159
made friends with?

496
00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:06.000
Just negotiate with fascists and find a suitable
compromise between freedom and genocide?

497
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.250
Hixler was a sober vegetarian who liked dogs,
you know!

498
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.250
YEAH!

499
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.570
To what ‘badness’ is owed empathy and
to which kind do we need to be on the lookout

500
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:15.570
for?

501
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.940
Maybe if we just give that apparent bad guy
or rival a chance, we’ll learn that they’re

502
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.120
not bad, and that we should apologize for
not seeing how rough they had it in spite

503
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.779
of the complete lack of their ability to communicate
their hard shit.

504
00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:30.840
It’s OUR FAULT that we didn’t have enough
empathy.

505
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.331
And this is on TOP of the aforementioned ‘wolf
in sheep's clothing’ trope that’s been

506
00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:35.889
established lately.

507
00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:37.950
Where you don’t know WHO the Disney Villain
is.

508
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:43.640
That it’s NOT the seemingly obvious bad
guy, but instead, the person you wouldn’t

509
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.649
have expected.

510
00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:50.580
Which culminates in this grand encouragement
to empathize with those that the public decries

511
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:56.470
as a villain, but constantly be on guard to
wait for a moment when the REAL bad guy shows

512
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.520
their true colors.

513
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.540
All the while this media does very little
to establish a methodology for how to differentiate

514
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.730
between either of those, or to point out when
someone really is as straightforward as they

515
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:08.730
seem.

516
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.740
That person holding up a convenience store
is likely in that situation of generational

517
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.529
poverty regardless of their decisions.

518
00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:20.299
But that person at a rally threatening violence
against trans people, immigrants, or people

519
00:32:20.299 --> 00:32:22.630
of color…

520
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.950
They have made some CHOICES.

521
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.950
“Choices”

522
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.530
Taking people who turn to violence or violent
rhetoric, and trying to find clues in their

523
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:36.370
past to justify WHY they would do that inherently
seeks to frame them as a victim.

524
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.900
What was done UNTO them to MAKE them feel
this way?

525
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.059
They are framed as a victim of a larger societal
construct.

526
00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:44.059
Which.

527
00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:45.350
Jesus christ, people—

528
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:51.390
-inclined to feel that these people who have
cake are a threat to your ability to have

529
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.390
cake.

530
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:58.470
A key component of this anger is the fear
and outrage of a perceived victimhood, which

531
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.480
offers a sense of righteousness when taking
steps to righting a perceived wrong.

532
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.520
The more this kind of focus is placed upon
analyzing these fascists as lost boys who

533
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.059
society left behind, the more we reinforce
these structures of self-victimization.

534
00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:15.580
Especially insofar as it validates a fear
that society has forgotten about those of

535
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.390
privilege, and to what privilege itself is
allegedly owed.

536
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.919
And at the end of this is the promise that
investigating why someone would want to commit

537
00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:31.139
to this kind of organized bigotry would offer
some technique on how to prevent it.

538
00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:36.309
But granted, especially in America, there
are two ‘p-words’ — pussy, and preventative.

539
00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:39.880
Ben Shapiro:
“Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass

540
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.880
P-word.”

541
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.240
So we end up in a cultural state where we
have no recourse for how to redirect people

542
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.929
out of fascist circles, leading to a collection
of trans women fighting back a cumulative

543
00:33:49.929 --> 00:33:54.639
nervous breakdown from their efforts of trying
to stem the tide of this pipeline without

544
00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:55.639
a road map.

545
00:33:55.639 --> 00:34:01.870
In spite of all this information we have,
we still know very little about how to de-radicalize

546
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.590
people from these violent spaces.

547
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:08.960
And without the information being used — and
there is a LOT of information — to develop

548
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.369
practical solutions to a literal threat against
contemporary Democracy, we just have a heap

549
00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:17.080
of data about fascists’ emotions.

550
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.169
Party.

551
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:23.179
We have next to no documentation about the
success rates of citizens, creators, influencers,

552
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:27.740
and entertainers who are throwing darts in
the dark to figure out what’s going to stick.

553
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:33.399
And also next to no public interest in the
people who are victims OF this hateful, violent

554
00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:34.770
rhetoric.

555
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:40.740
Because you’d think that in an empathic,
compassionate society, those are the people

556
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:47.740
— the people whose very lives are an affront
to fascism — to whom our interest would

557
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.760
be drawn.

558
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760
But no.

559
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.970
Let’s feed into the privilege of people
who feel like their privilege owes them more

560
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:57.080
out of life, by making everything about their
emotions.

561
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.080
Fascists: they’re the REAL victims of fascism
— The moral weight of their choices are

562
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.810
the real casualties.

563
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:09.300
Which is a romantic notion, if you don’t
take into account actual fascists in real

564
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300
life.

565
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.839
The hordes of SS officers being called to
testify at Nuremberg who expressed not a feather

566
00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:16.990
of remorse for their actions.

567
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:21.230
And I don’t even want to blame all of our
leaders and lawmakers for not making efforts

568
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:26.800
to legislate the kind of circumstances that
could make a whole population comfortable

569
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.520
enough to not feel like their way of life
is at risk.

570
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:38.340
Raise wages to match the cost of living, impose
rent control to force landlords to price competitively,

571
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.640
subsidize essential goods, generate public
options for power, water, and communications.

572
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.920
Because there are people who are trying to
do these things.

573
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.160
The problem is, when it comes to a substantial
portion of the population—

574
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.700
-anger can be a potent and necessary motivational
tool, if you spend too long being angry — getting

575
00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.750
what you want isn’t going to make you feel
better — you just want to have your anger

576
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:01.750
justified.

577
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.940
You want permission to be angry.

578
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.250
Which is how you end up in situations where
the population actively resists actions that

579
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.150
will make their lives easier.

580
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.109
And this can be indoctrinated through any
number of methods— usually by saying “this

581
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:18.130
helpful thing is actually part of an organization
you hate.”

582
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.900
You hate the organization, so you hate the
thing.

583
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:26.060
Coupled with a strong centrist movement that
thinks that life can be beautiful as long

584
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.490
as you ignore anything that isn’t — well
this is how you get fascists.

585
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:37.030
MC: We have no troubles here.

586
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.390
Here life is beautiful!

587
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.520
And all of this isn’t just in reference
to the Third Reich or The KKK or their sad

588
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.050
little modern imitators.

589
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.780
There are a large number of groups in human
history who fought from the bottom rung of

590
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.030
the ladder to improve their living conditions.

591
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:58.920
From slave revolts over the span of the Roman
Empire — to several waves of French peasants

592
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:05.820
who, over the course of a century, toppled
a disconnected and clueless ruling aristocracy,

593
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.860
and changed the political landscape of Europe
to this day.

594
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.060
As much as we look at those battles and say:
“Yes those were righteous causes.”

595
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:18.570
The Third Reich and the KKK also felt their
causes were righteous.

596
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:24.680
Which brings us to today where — sigh — a
significant group of people seem to hold queer

597
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.720
people responsible for all the world’s problems.

598
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.050
And not, you know, the ongoing greed-mongering,
crony-capitalist, post-colonial, nepotistic,

599
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.400
pseudo-democratic oligarchy which we like
to pretend passes for a society that lends

600
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.770
power to the people.

601
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.780
But let’s NOT blame the people running that
show, and instead let’s blame preferred

602
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.160
pronouns as the root of all evil.

603
00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.160
That’s…

604
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.440
That’s it…

605
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.440
That…

606
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.400
We — the left-leaning, progressive, and
socially-minded of us — typically celebrate

607
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.619
the downtrodden and underclasses standing
up for their own dignities.

608
00:37:55.619 --> 00:38:01.150
But it’s this language of ‘righteousness’
that seems to work against us at times.

609
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.680
Righteousness is a vague term, and (I find)
more accurately describes a kind of air that

610
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:12.010
someone carries themself with, rather than
an objective sense of doing what is right

611
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.220
or just.

612
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.320
Which explains a lot about our society, actually.

613
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.280
But it’s the specific word ‘righteous’
that messes it all up.

614
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:25.210
Because while there may be — through some
ethical philosophy — an objective sense

615
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:32.180
of what is truly righteous through any singular
definition of the word… in a pragmatic sense,

616
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.070
the word really does boil down to perspective.

617
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:41.000
For whom is justice liberation; and for whom
is justice regression?

618
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.910
In our fights and struggles for the minorities
and second-class citizens to be recognized

619
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.091
with dignity and respect, the language of
our struggle did not go unnoticed.

620
00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:57.030
And the privileged, who celebrate heroism
and heroic deeds envy these battles and they

621
00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:02.420
envy our figureheads for representing the
values they can only ascribe to their ancestors.

622
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:07.829
They cannot live out these battles in their
lifetimes — so they make a show of it.

623
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:09.760
And we’ve seen this song and dance before.

624
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.720
We’ve heard this music, the lyrics calling
out to condemn those who barely have any rights

625
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.940
to begin with.

626
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.240
These songs, these dances.

627
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.560
They’re not new.

628
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:24.420
We’ve seen them play out over and over again
on stages all around the world.

629
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.790
These people put on a show to tell the world
how repressed they are, even though they’re

630
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.109
in the biggest show in town.

631
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:33.369
But it’s all so hollow.

632
00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:36.670
Like a story written by an AI.

633
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:41.730
They plagiarize our struggles and our fights
and appropriate it into their pageantry.

634
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:49.430
But our struggles, our victories, our lives
will always outlast their theatrics — because

635
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.450
theater is only a story…

636
00:39:52.450 --> 00:42:37.450
And every story, eventually, comes to an end.
