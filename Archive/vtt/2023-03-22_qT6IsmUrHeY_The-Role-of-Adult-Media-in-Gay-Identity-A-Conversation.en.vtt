this video is brought to you by atlasvpn
hi everyone welcome to the second

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.720
episode of gays Behaving Badly my name
is James I'm Nick and there will be a

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.440
Chiron under your name giving all your
information stuff and I assume a Chiron

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.380
under your probably maybe um
everyone in the whole world everybody we

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
all want to cancel you
so the first episode of this came out

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.199
last year where we talked about
asexuality and we want to keep doing

7
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.960
episodes like this there's been a bit of
a break obviously but we want to

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
actually do this on a monthly basis so
hopefully we first it was really fun it

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.040
was uh and did well which is the
important thing

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100
um

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
um but in today's episode we're going to
be talking about the role of adult media

12
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.160
in the development of uh gay identity
specifically paying attention to Gay and

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320
bisexual men but also kind of taking a
look at how it can help how it can

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.620
develop with lesbian identity as well
because I think porn has a big influence

15
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.040
on that as well well I think everyone in
the queer community and granted like

16
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.439
we're only going to touch on this
because I I don't know if anyone's

17
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.740
noticed this but neither James nor
myself are lesbians

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.220
um big shock uh you heard it here first
folks

19
00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.340
um so like we can't really speak on that
with authority but like from kind of an

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.460
outside end like we have some thoughts
on that especially from talking to

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.000
lesbians in our lives
um that sounds like a soap opera

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.080
lesbians in our lives I've seen in our
lives that would be an interesting sofa

23
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.579
lots of moving so like is actually
recently there has been a very there is

24
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.880
a growing
under the surface conversation in queer

25
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.900
communities about the role of adult
media especially as we have begun to see

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.619
ourselves we have began to begin our
began

27
00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.820
I think it's kind of we'll we'll get
into it um because this is just the

28
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.720
introduction so this is the introduction

now that the ad read is done we are

47
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.000
entering segment number one which is
about stuff so Nick

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500
what are we talking about today what
what like okay so obviously the premise

49
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.120
of this is that
we're talking bisexual men men who love

50
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.480
men men who are attracted to men
umam is a better term than MLM because

51
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.180
you don't have to love someone have sex
with sex with ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am uh

52
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
that would be pretty poetic
um and then for women it's LOL

53
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.440
ma'am-in-law

54
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.739
um
so I guess the kind of premise we're

55
00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.080
running off of here is that gay men
unlike straight men

56
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.879
really discovered their the first time
that they can visually see their

57
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.860
sexuality is in porn that's certainly
how it used to be absolutely yeah uh

58
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.959
before like Heart Stopper and stuff like
that but definitely men of let's say men

59
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.440
who hit puberty before 2000 and yes 17.
um and especially earlier in that when

60
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.160
we get into like you know you'd see a
skin flick or you'd see a skin mag

61
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.560
um skin Flex the 70s again uh yeah I
actually love those terms can Megan's

62
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.880
conflict
um I I think they're we our society has

63
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.440
done a fantastic job at completely
disenfranchising slang but yeah so like

64
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280
getting back on topic because we're
we're giving ourselves time limits here

65
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.740
yeah so um the role of porn in this case
is to sort of normalize uh this kind of

66
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.400
query density and sort of you know oh
cause and Awakening literally an

67
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.380
Awakening in order earlier context yeah
um that was the because you know of

68
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.220
reasons you didn't really have a whole
lot of opportunities to see gay Identity

69
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.000
or yeah because like growing up like I
had Will and Grace but what like there

70
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.759
wasn't a whole lot of like men loving
men on Will and Grace well yeah

71
00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.940
especially and I I lucked out because I
had Queer as Folk but there were a lot

72
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.620
of people my age who did not know that
that existed didn't stay up late our

73
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.419
society completely disenfranchises the
role of sexuality and the sex life

74
00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.720
um and that's true even in the context
of asexual people is you you gotta

75
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.320
experiment around a little bit to know
that you don't like that so not having a

76
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.500
sex life is still an element of
sexuality yeah

77
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.220
um uh and Will and Grace doesn't really
comment on anything in terms of

78
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.259
sexuality that's kind of just social
dynamics yeah um so having to do gay men

79
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.259
learn from gay porn um they learn that
gay sex exists essentially

80
00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.039
um and how to have it not necessarily
how to have it but that it's something

81
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.220
that people around the world do have
yeah

82
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.960
um sex with other men uh and that it
doesn't that's it's not exclusively some

83
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.320
think that's romantic that sexuality
does exist and sort of validating those

84
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.280
sexual feelings because there isn't a
gender dynamic between men and women

85
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.220
that is kind of there's no gender
dynamic between men and right right

86
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.880
there isn't the same gender Dynamic
there it's a very different gender

87
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.240
dynamic between two men than it is
between a man and a woman yeah

88
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.600
um and because media is wrought with the
necessitative love needs to precede sex

89
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.460
yeah for a lot of straight entanglements
which leads to a lot of men exploit

90
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.520
sorry men exploiting women uh their
feelings so that they can be sexual

91
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.060
men who have sex with men do not have
that not necessarily I think I mean I

92
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.660
think they do I mean because they're
watching just as much straight media as

93
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.139
straight men so they are picking up the
same kind of Dynamics I suppose but I've

94
00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.380
heard this from like multiple people and
especially straight women who kind of

95
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.460
like analyze sort of like from a
distance what it might be like to sort

96
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.060
of be in that sexual atmosphere is that
um

97
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.100
a lot of women kind of and this is me
kind of quoting straight women uh kind

98
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.660
of have these uh emotional entanglements
like they they like to have emotions and

99
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.199
sex yeah whereas men don't always like
to have that

100
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.300
um and this whether this is biology or
whether this is uh social

101
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.500
um conditioning I can't really say but
it seems to be that in gay circles

102
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.139
especially for younger gay men we talked
about it the simple this at some point

103
00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.380
like because
um gay sex is something you quote

104
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.740
shouldn't be having if you want to have
it there's nothing holding you back

105
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.099
there's no social Dynamic there's no
social structure telling you to hold

106
00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:38.639
back and leave for marriage if you're
gonna have sex with men yeah because the

107
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:43.139
social attitude is just don't do it
um so I think porn act like porn being

108
00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.639
the first exposure to real
um human sexual human sexuality in a

109
00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:53.039
homosexual context uh it is really not
important might be the wrong word but

110
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:57.840
it's really fundamental in establishing
those uh fast and loose sex oh I think

111
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.860
it I think maybe not today I don't think
today

112
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:07.139
but I think for Generations
the like

113
00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:13.740
it was fundamental whether it was you
know in the 60s or 70s you know meeting

114
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:20.759
usually at a teenage guy meeting an
older man who has you know some reels

115
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.060
um and by reels I mean eight millimeter
reels because everything was on film

116
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.900
there were no videotapes yet or then
going into the 80s where you know there

117
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:33.000
were videotapes that you could get porn
was really the first time that you saw

118
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.860
men being intimate with other men
whether that's love or sex being

119
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.459
intimate with other men there's another
angle there too because there's a

120
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:45.959
difference between being exposed to porn
and being exposed to two guys in a

121
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:49.140
cruise accidentally stumbling on two
guys in a crew spot and that being their

122
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.120
first gay sort of experience is that
porn is an industry and when he sets it

123
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.279
up yeah it's it's not sort of a um but a
traumatic moment it's

124
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:04.200
it's also validating because you get to
see not only our two men having sex is

125
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.420
there is an industry around these two
men having sex yeah so even if

126
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.620
um you don't know any gay men in your
small town in Nebraska

127
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.980
um
there is an something in your back brain

128
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.580
that says that there are many people who
consume this or else they wouldn't have

129
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.600
made it yeah um so I think that this
exists for a reason which means there

130
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.360
are other people that meanwhile exactly
so I think that's also another

131
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.540
fundamental area of just normalizing
masquerade entity yeah um and and so for

132
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.899
that reason I think that because it has
been so formative for gay people it's a

133
00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:40.860
lot more common for gay men to
appreciate porn and openly discuss porn

134
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.300
than gay than straight men whereas you
watch even rom-coms and it's like oh the

135
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.860
husband has a a dirty movie stash that
his wife doesn't know about it yeah or

136
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.160
the magazines under the mattress it's a
box of Shame

137
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.940
um that you shouldn't be having because
you know your wife wants your the the

138
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.300
normative idea in these movies is the
wife wants to be the one and only yeah

139
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.640
and anything pornographic is kind of you
know uh to use your phrase verboten

140
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.320
um it's a very different Dynamic whereas
porn is kind of not maybe not openly

141
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.180
accepted but very publicly accepted
um and depending upon like we get into

142
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.180
the like maybe the Dynamics of the porn
themselves but it is it is sort of

143
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:27.420
it's the first place for and like I said
like we said it nowadays you know you

144
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.140
have Heart Stopper you have young Royals
you have these shows on Netflix that a

145
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.000
12 year old can watch and feel seen for
the first time yeah but for many many

146
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.580
many many generations the first time you
felt seen as a game or bisexual man was

147
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.860
in adult media yeah and I don't think
it's the same necessarily the same for

148
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.480
lesbians where that's the first time you
feel seen But it sort of like the

149
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.500
question is it the same thing for
lesbians or is it different well

150
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.680
certainly lesbian porn is a lot more
common because there is a huge straight

151
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.140
consumer base yeah that's that's the big
difference is that gay porn is produced

152
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.560
for gay men straight porn is produced
for straight men lesbian porn is

153
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.160
produced for straight men there is a
huge difference between lesbian porn

154
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.459
that is produced for straight men and
versus for women there's a huge

155
00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:20.700
difference between straight and a huge
difference in how much of it is made oh

156
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.300
yeah yeah because there's way more way
less straight lesbian porn made for

157
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.640
lesbians because most porn producers who
produce lesbian porn assume that women

158
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.420
aren't interested
and as Anne Rice has shown by writing

159
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.880
several best-selling pornographic albums
women are interested they you know the

160
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.820
what she said they just don't want to go
to that back alley store near the

161
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.680
airport to get it is erotica a much
stronger genre of porn for lesbians

162
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.880
or for women in general I would think
yes uh it's the feather versus this this

163
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.980
might come from managing and not safe
for work Discord server but lesbians

164
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.680
seem much more interested in the written
word yeah

165
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.320
um but another thing that I found really
interesting is we're closing off this

166
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.040
topic is going to say it's the feather
versus The Brick it's not a brick

167
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.220
that's harder to
harder to do in visual but there's more

168
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.420
reluctance to do that but just finishing
off there's a big difference in straight

169
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.300
porn meant for men and straight women
for straight women oh a huge difference

170
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.120
I didn't know that until I started
seeing it

171
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.640
um I actually don't mind watching
straight porn made for women well

172
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.160
straight porn meant for women is there
there's a story to it there is a reason

173
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
these two people are having even just in
the shot and the way the models perform

174
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.000
because the straight Point made for
women is much more focused on the man

175
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.420
um oh yeah the woman isn't doing the
fake moaning thing at least not as much

176
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.260
yeah you focus a lot more on his body
the performance is there but it's the

177
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.200
camera yeah
um and there's things that's really

178
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.459
interesting yeah and like growing up
that was my my first exposure obviously

179
00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:57.120
was straight porn we had a pay-per-view
descrambler so every night at midnight

180
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.360
the Pay-Per-View channels turned into
the porn channels

181
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.800
um and it was all straight or lesbian
porn and that was my first sort of

182
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.240
exposure to it and that's why I knew it
existed so when we actually got a

183
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.760
computer I was like I wonder if gay
stuff exists and oh boy did I find out

184
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.440
that it did but we'll get more into a
person that kind of stuff after the

185
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.680
break
and we're back from the break we're

186
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.639
assuming this video gets monetized it
might not but we're we're playing that

187
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:30.060
game uh but we don't have any visuals
and we're not really talking about any

188
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.360
like oh but YouTube might just be but
again we're gonna we're going to talk

189
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.600
about some personal experiences yeah so
this segment we're going to talk about

190
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.300
our personal experiences
um sort of

191
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.240
reflecting on
the role that it's had in developing

192
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.800
sort of our sensibilities because we
both James and I both of us even though

193
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.820
I am technically a young Millennial and
you're a mid-millennial two years older

194
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.300
than you I don't know amid I am mid
nothing

195
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.980
you certainly are not uh you don't even
like having the the temperature in the

196
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.639
car in the in halfway
all cold or all hot

197
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.139
uh like I said uh anyway porn

198
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.279
I also had my kind of opening
experiences uh in to sexuality through

199
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:23.519
porn like because I think very few
people few people have sex and that's

200
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:26.519
their first experience
with sex

201
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:31.440
is sexual of course yeah like I I I
don't know if everyone who like because

202
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.500
I think of back to a lot of the girls I
knew they weren't watching porn before

203
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.700
they had sex but they've definitely seen
sex scenes in movies yes and stuff like

204
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.839
that so there was an expectation of what
sex would be and I think that and that

205
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:47.940
expectation very disappointed yeah the
expectation for a lot of girls is he

206
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.240
slides in and you're at home base and
that's not how it works

207
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.880
and that's the expectation a lot of
straight guys are left with too and

208
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.399
they're like oh Jesus I'm doing
something wrong why isn't she moaning

209
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.579
I'm not doing anything wrong yeah
meanwhile she's listening to The

210
00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:08.579
Crickets outside uh but yeah so like
what like did before kind of going into

211
00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:14.279
a sexual realm did you watch porn yes
there was on my weird I think I it

212
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:18.300
wasn't a cable it was kind of network
there was this French Canadian of the

213
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:23.579
French Channel yeah and late at night
when I would be up like I I saw it and

214
00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:28.320
that's kind of was my first really like
whoa they are that's penis like for and

215
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.339
it was the American viewers
um in Canada there are French channels

216
00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:38.180
and there was one in particular that
after about 10 pm would start showing

217
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:44.040
basically porn the show that I remember
it was called Blue Nui uh blue night

218
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.820
yeah uh is that
oh yeah I remember okay okay a lot

219
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.380
I feel like every Canadian guy I'm so
I've talked to so many gay guys who like

220
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.000
the topic will come up and he's like are
you talking about blue movie

221
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.160
and so like that's that's a start and
like if you're like me and you just have

222
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.220
no idea that you're gay early on like
you're really confused or like I'm

223
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:15.360
getting off to this I'm not gay and it's
like no you're just looking at him yeah

224
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.500
um and Bloon read I think also kind of
uh that's actually a really interesting

225
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.959
thing uh sorry for yeah yeah that's a
really interesting thing I've actually

226
00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:30.480
uh seen from heard from a lot of gay men
is that they watched either that or they

227
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.139
watched straight porn and they
identified not with the man they

228
00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:40.259
identified with the woman oh yes big yes
um which kind of I think you know

229
00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:43.860
whether that's a top thing or a bottom
thing it's the you are the person who is

230
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.720
with the man you are not the yeah the
you know you're not with the woman so

231
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.420
you identify with the woman and I think
that kind of can lead to a lot of

232
00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.420
um a lot of gay men expecting a certain
kind of experience yeah from actually

233
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.500
having sex again the sort of slide into
home base immediately

234
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:14.040
just doesn't happen yeah and because
even in gay porn it's it's just like

235
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.240
yeah and in gay porn like
there's also a reason why they call them

236
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.780
porn actors and this is something about
that porn doesn't prepare you for is

237
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.319
that you have kind of this is a
performance this is a performance and

238
00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:30.480
it's really uncommon that you kind of
have sex like that because like I and

239
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.380
this is so weird with gay gay men is
when they start having sex I've had like

240
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.179
a few early kind of instances with a few
different guys

241
00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:44.940
um it's like early in my sexual career I
I re I'm looking back I realized we were

242
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.700
trying to have sex like porn people like
porn stars

243
00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:54.780
sorry about that everyone had a wee bit
of a technical difficulty or the

244
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.900
microphone fell down and took the iPad
with it so yeah I was saying that we

245
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.919
were trying to have sex like porn stars
because that was what we thought sex was

246
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:05.880
supposed to be when like really having
sex in person is a very different

247
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.820
experience than watching people have sex
it's much

248
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.760
slower it's much slower and just ideally
and there doesn't need to be as much of

249
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.600
an outrageous display because you are
getting so much Sensation from your body

250
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.240
contact and you're seeing each other's
in most in say 50 of cases you're seeing

251
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.799
each other's face it also does not not
last nearly as long no there are gay

252
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:32.820
porn videos that are 40 minutes long and
I feel like a lot of people who watch

253
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.460
those like the Sean Cody videos and a
lot some men.com videos and they think

254
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.840
okay this is going to last for 40
minutes and then in reality it's more

255
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.580
like 10 to 15 if even like sometimes it
can even be as like five minutes and

256
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.419
like they might be disappointed by that
or if they're at the bottom they're

257
00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:55.620
probably relieved yeah and another thing
that porn does not like there's a lot

258
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.220
that porn sets you up for is like
establishing like a psychology of sex

259
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.179
acceptance but like there's a lot that
porn does not prepare you for porn

260
00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.580
doesn't show you douching porn doesn't
show you

261
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.760
um how to the magic lubrication the
magic lubrication

262
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.120
the magical condoms use condoms unless
you're with like a very trusted

263
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.480
long-term partner yeah um that was the
thing in porn for a long time they

264
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.700
didn't want to remind viewers of condoms
because then they would think of STDs so

265
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.500
what would happen is they would like
have a wide shot of you know the

266
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.460
penetration about to happen and then a
close-up in the condom just appears yeah

267
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.240
um and something about me is like I used
to be like oh I love bear backboard now

268
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.020
I'm just indifferent I'm completely
indifferent to it yeah

269
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.799
um porn is porn porn is porn
um it's about it's about the people

270
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:45.000
especially as I've learned that as I
have sex the penetration is my least

271
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.480
favorite part of sex yeah
um and this is part of like maybe this

272
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.080
is an ace thing but also like when I do
go out of my way to engage in sexual

273
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.620
activities uh it's foreplay
um the only time that you're really

274
00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.480
going to get sexual sexual intercourse
that lasts for longer than 15 minutes is

275
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.059
if you have an amendment foreplay
because I have had sexual encounters

276
00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:08.220
that have lasted like two hours long
because it's foreplay a little bit of

277
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.600
contact
um cuddling pillow talk and then it's

278
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.260
like repeat the cycle yeah and that's
how sex lasts for a long time and

279
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.460
apparently that's lesbian sex that's
just how lesbian yeah I think it was a

280
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.360
lesbian do sex it might be shishi LaRue
that I'm thinking of that the quote came

281
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.559
from but it was something along the
lines of you know if you look at a movie

282
00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:32.700
um the third act the climax that's
penetration but you need the First Act

283
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.480
and the second act to get there or it
feels like it's it's nothing it means

284
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.260
nothing to you and so you need that
build up

285
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.280
and you know the the climax of a movie
takes place for five pages of the script

286
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.320
yeah and so if you expect the climax to
take place for you know 60 pages of the

287
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.320
script you're going to be disappointed
or it's going to be bad but also like I

288
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.880
think that porn uh I think something
that porn has done negatively for the

289
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.799
gay community especially is narrowed our
definition of what sex is oh absolutely

290
00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:07.140
it penetration or even oral isn't really
considered sex yeah um the sex that I

291
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.140
like to have is literally just dry
humping not dry humping it's naked dry

292
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.480
humping but you know like that kind of
body contact rubbing like that's kind of

293
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.980
well I I just think that lasts longer
yeah that's more intimate

294
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.520
um there's no and this is another thing
about anal sex it's uncomfortable uh to

295
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.419
get them to not not just receiving it
but getting in the position well yeah

296
00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:31.200
because like you're either you know kind
of doing a doggy style in which case

297
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.140
you're you know your legs your back is
arched like you're yeah or your your

298
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:43.679
legs are up or whatever and in any
you're it's it's a workout yeah like

299
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:46.860
um I feel like porn has done a lot to
sort of discredit a lot of you know

300
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.580
experimentation that comes from the sex
like there are expectations uh because

301
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.780
of porn oh yeah um because like most
people think their first time needs to

302
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.140
be
exactly what they have been sort of

303
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.340
shown the first time is yeah and you
know and then nothing else counts keep

304
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.460
in mind where we've said gay men and
straight women get their ideas about sex

305
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.280
from like so of course like these
there's going to be a lot of

306
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.900
disappointment because you know
especially I I this is something I

307
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.760
really hate about a lot of the rash of
current media that comes out about you

308
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.159
know featuring gay characters especially
if they start do having sex I I get so

309
00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:27.059
angry because looking at how they depict
sex is just terrible yeah um for

310
00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:30.179
instance you're almost never going to
come from bottoming

311
00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:35.280
um almost never uh it's rare that guys
can and even then when they can do it is

312
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.900
that in a lot of
like media yes other than porn yeah I

313
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.640
saw it was a you know it was it was it
was sort of like a soft course vaccine

314
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.340
yeah like kind of straight people and
the bottom guy was getting uh penetrated

315
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.080
um the sex lasted for about two minutes
like two minutes and he was saying like

316
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.140
no no stop stop stop I'm getting close
okay I'm coming anyway just keep going

317
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.280
like I was like what you're you're
bottoming you're bottoming that's that's

318
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.539
it's very rare I mean we may have been
you know touching him so it wasn't oh

319
00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:09.960
okay you could see
um and I and once again we go back to

320
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.360
like the Brokeback Mountain things like
where there's bottoming after eating a

321
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.919
plate of wheat plate full of beans like
like there is a reluctance no lube with

322
00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:21.299
a plate full of beans there is a there
is a reluctance to depict how sex

323
00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:26.400
actually happens and I don't know why
after seeing it with gay content even

324
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.140
made by gay creators I'm like why are
you depicting it this way yeah

325
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.780
especially been like I think I think
they're they're depicting it that way

326
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.159
the same reason that gay rom-coms are
basically straight ROM comes with uh

327
00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:45.360
with a gender reversal because the the
it has been created there is a box to

328
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.280
fill and we have to fill it and so we're
basically creating straight porn but

329
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.980
with two men because that's the
expectation yeah and before we close off

330
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:58.080
the segment I just want to touch on one
more point about how I think uh because

331
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.039
in the 70s I think it was 70s or 80s
there was a sort of conflict between San

332
00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:08.700
Francisco and La style porn uh yeah
where I think it was uh La was very kind

333
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.440
of scene based like you just had a
pornographic scene whereas L.A was very

334
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.220
trying to emulate Hollywood okay so it
was the other way around so la was

335
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.980
making story based porn and San
Francisco is making you know

336
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.480
pornographic scenes yeah okay so and
then it just kind of swinged sung in the

337
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.780
way of San Francisco where it's like you
just had it was a scene opened

338
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.059
penetration sex finish yeah curtain uh
yeah

339
00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:37.080
um so I think that has kind of affected
the way that a lot of media creators

340
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:43.140
approach making
um love scenes in movies like of sex

341
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:48.780
scenes and movies because it is that
very you know penetration sex curtain

342
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.860
yeah um whereas like I think if we
appreciated more narrative porn we would

343
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.940
be willing to depict the the ways that
foreplay the build up not just foreplay

344
00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.720
the build up but the way that sexual
preparation can be incredibly erotic

345
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.280
sort of like the process of just I think
there are ways to make a hot scene about

346
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.280
a guy putting on a condom I think you
can make that sexy well yeah shishi

347
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.799
LaRue kind of like made that a point
like there was a whole safe sex campaign

348
00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:17.520
yeah because like you you frame that as
titillation yeah like that that is part

349
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.760
of the like the prep prepping for sex is
part of the build up you know yeah those

350
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.299
are things those are tools you can use
they're not obstacles and this is this

351
00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:27.779
is something I wanted to just touch on
because this will be its own video uh

352
00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:33.539
it's its own gays Behaving Badly video
in the future I think the our society's

353
00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:40.740
complete rejection yeah rejection of sex
workers plays a lot into this because

354
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:46.620
sex workers are people people they are
professionals they understand you know

355
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:53.159
okay you're into this they play into it
and whatnot and in many cases every sex

356
00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:58.740
worker that I know is a sex educator
they understand the sort of psychology

357
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:06.179
of sex and you know there there is a
group of people that we reject as having

358
00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:11.940
any kind of authority on this who could
open people's minds to what you know a

359
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.100
first time should actually be or what a
man should expect from a woman or what a

360
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.000
top should expect from a bottom or vice
versa the [ __ ] destroyers had like a sex

361
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.740
ad segment on Netflix before they broke
up yeah but it's like rest in peace and

362
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.779
like I know sex workers in my personal
life who they

363
00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:36.179
when they work with clients they've told
me they they they go at their Pace they

364
00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:39.900
want like if they've got to read the
room well yeah and like if the client

365
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.380
they like I I know one in particular who
has said that he works with a lot of

366
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.419
virgins and they come in thinking okay
this is what it's going to be and

367
00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:52.500
he doesn't tell them that he's like
taking it slower but he does and then

368
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.520
they have a much more enjoyable
experience than you know the 10-minute

369
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.600
tussle that honestly I wish that I my
first time would have been with someone

370
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.940
who was more experienced who knew what
they were doing

371
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.400
um we only had sex with one person
before me and he bought him for that

372
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.140
yeah
um and I have

373
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.600
since day one I have had uh problems in
my backside because of sex because it

374
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.720
wasn't just wasn't done properly
routinely in my life I've been with a

375
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.539
lot of guys who just did not do it
properly and I mean like I have

376
00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:25.740
notoriously on streams talked about how
young I was when I started having sex

377
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.700
and I I wish that I had at least had
some information because we were using

378
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.900
butter
yeah uh so on that we're gonna go to our

379
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.900
maybe
maybe an ad break

380
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.340
pray for us guys pray for us not from
Bay cell that's for sure I hope it's for

381
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.900
Christian Ringle oh that'd be great
and we're back maybe or we we are back

382
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.159
but we've never gone there may yeah we
may not have gone anywhere cot welcome

383
00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:58.860
back to the show all right uh so you you
wanted to start off this segment segment

384
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.700
yeah yeah
um talking about uh the ways that porn

385
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.279
influenced media about sex and um the
way the median mainstream media depicts

386
00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:11.400
sex because of influenced by porn but
also

387
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.659
um gay people are now being accepted
into media that is not just you know

388
00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:18.720
going to have a sex scene because we
have things like Heart Stopper among

389
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.960
numerous Myriad of other things directed
at

390
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.559
um not necessarily children but younger
audiences like sort of that ya TV sort

391
00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:29.220
of area yeah where there are now gay
characters and the way they are because

392
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.200
there are now gay like not just YA books
which are basically you know for 16 and

393
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.960
17 year olds there's there's gay
um middle grade books yeah yeah and you

394
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.500
know they're there's gay characters and
boyfriends and girlfriends and stuff in

395
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.340
there but they're meant for you know 11
and 12 year olds so they they are much

396
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.720
more I want to say Innocent but they're
you know they're not saying they're not

397
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.360
saying gay is focused on the sex act
yeah yeah absolutely and well I I well I

398
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.960
welcome that and I'm glad for that I am
seeing some concerning Trends about the

399
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.940
way that that's kind of playing out
especially like in younger Generations

400
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.960
um in ways that I hope that
um you know as they get older they'll

401
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.340
kind of you know flash them get a little
bit more you know accepting of these

402
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.840
things because there is a rash of no
king of Pride that has been seen among

403
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.460
the younger younger queer people but
also you kind of said it earlier when

404
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.760
um
uh media media about like you know

405
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.480
straight couples is very you said it
that in um gay rom-coms they basically

406
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.779
just take a straight rom-com and you
know swap out a gender yeah

407
00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:38.580
um and in those the ideas of romance and
sex are very idealized in the sense that

408
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.240
you love someone before you actually you
know had to commit to have sex with them

409
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.740
which is something you don't have to do
that's not a human necessity no sex sex

410
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.860
actually is a human necessity we have to
do it to continue to have humans whereas

411
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.419
love is not a human necessity but also
sex is one of the best mood stabilized

412
00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:01.559
sexual intercourse masturbation they're
the best mood stabilizers that yeah like

413
00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:06.620
sexual acts either by yourself or any
kind of sexual act with another person

414
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.460
is a mood stabilizer it's an
antidepressant for many of us like for

415
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.480
many of us like a dripping sweeping
generalization of human physiology Sexes

416
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.039
I would say essential for our species
not necessarily for babies but just for

417
00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:23.820
maintaining
um good mental health good mental health

418
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.880
um

419
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.480
because like you know like I have seen
multiple people say like when you are

420
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.840
when you feel a little bit of a dip jerk
off it's like taking a Xanax and it's

421
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.679
not inaccurate uh but you can't jerk off
everywhere you can't jerk off in the

422
00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:45.659
places that you probably should take a
Xanax yeah so you know uh don't don't

423
00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:48.720
diogenase this stuff
um

424
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.700
uh so it is important to you know see
the right mental professional medical

425
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.659
professionals to get the right kind of
medications that are required but yeah

426
00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:03.419
part of that comes from an element of
demystifying and destigmatizing sex and

427
00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:06.240
then want the need to have sex in
general yeah because that's something we

428
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.720
don't say sex is kind of seen as a
luxury or masturbation sexual

429
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.380
intercourse sexual pleasure is seen as a
luxury but I don't think we as a species

430
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.100
we should look at it that way and
granted of course this is there's there

431
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.159
also are Ace people who just have no sex
drive and who do not need this and

432
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:24.539
that's fine so like my concern about the
way that a lot of gay media is being

433
00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:28.799
developed is that it is kind of just a
swap out for you know a woman for

434
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:31.919
another man and kind of put it in these
situations because then that kind of

435
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.520
facilitates that love needs to come
first sort of attitude we're divorcing

436
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.360
sex from love and love from sex I think
is something that is the next sexual

437
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.020
development of our species and I think
there is an issue specifically with gay

438
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.020
men
um

439
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:50.100
when connecting with sex because for
instance when Heart Stopper came out on

440
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.100
Netflix there were a lot of gay men who
were very angry at the show for it not

441
00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.720
having a gay sex scene that the relation
the development of a gay relationship

442
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.500
and all of that kind of stuff they that
wasn't important it was the lack of a

443
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.039
gay sex scene that they were very
frustrated at

444
00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:10.860
um
and at the same time there are people

445
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.740
who are frustrated at shows that you
know they jump right into the sex and

446
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.320
it's like we need that mix we people do
we do and immediately have sex but

447
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:29.100
there's also people who do you know date
we have seen in many different facets of

448
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.039
life
people have a hard time divorcing

449
00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:35.279
fantasy from reality oh yeah yeah and
that was kind of what I wanted to say

450
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:38.340
about in the last what I was trying to
say in the last session about the way

451
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.940
that media approaches sex is that it
takes these kind of pornographic ideas

452
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.380
of like straight to like zero to 60 when
I think like if we had adopted a more

453
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.820
Narrative Approach the more La approach
in the 70s I think that we would have a

454
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.360
more more sex elements of media would be
more on Queer as Folk which would be

455
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.260
more educational sort of guiding you
through the process preparation yeah um

456
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.980
and sort of having these narrative
elements as build up rather than just

457
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.419
getting straight to it yeah
um so like the concern I have is that

458
00:33:06.419 --> 00:33:10.440
because straight media the straight
hegemony you their media development is

459
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.039
still locked in very Puritan puritanical
values yeah so like when we're just swap

460
00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:18.500
we're just taking the same media formats
but swapping out the sexuality we're

461
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.620
inserting that puritism isn't puritivism
back into the community because that's

462
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.519
how younger kids are going to get their
first exposure to homosexuality yeah

463
00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:28.500
they're going to
um

464
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500
let me not necessarily it might not be
Heart Stopper where they see it the

465
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.220
first time but another kind of media
like it like they're going to see that

466
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.700
probably before they start seeing porn
oh yeah absolutely they're going to see

467
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.779
young Royals or they're going to see
um that Spanish show that I can't watch

468
00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:47.159
because it's yeah Elite because they're
too goddamn good-looking

469
00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:50.700
um they're going to see those things I
have seen specific scenes of that

470
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.720
because they're God I'm good looking
they're going to see those things before

471
00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.320
they see porn and so you know kind of
mainstream media really

472
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.519
porn isn't the first place you learn
about ksx anymore which is probably a

473
00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:09.720
good thing because again porn is
really only it's portraying a fantasy

474
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:15.300
like I said whereas mainstream media can
make the argument that they are

475
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.960
portraying something more realistic I
that's what I would argue is I'd say

476
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.159
it's it's a different kind of fantasy
because there was a sexy and if you're

477
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:27.599
expecting sex like you'll see an Elite
you're you're gonna be sorry with porn

478
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:32.520
uh yeah young Royals also kind of has a
very idealistic sort of sex atmosphere

479
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.679
and sort of uh atmosphere about sex I
very much disagree there

480
00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:42.060
he's a prince yeah he's a prince but I
mean the sex like that's that's a

481
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.540
relationship idealistic yeah that's not
that's what I mean though is like we're

482
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.500
once again kind of you know associating
sex and romance instead of just

483
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.760
accepting that sex is something that
people do to literally feel good that's

484
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.780
where I'd like to see more media start
adopting that attitude

485
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.680
um The Sex in the City View of sex yes
exactly

486
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.460
um but not just it doesn't need to be in
teenage media no but like no College age

487
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.359
sort of depicting like first time
experiences first romances for like

488
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:13.079
Discovery areas
um and sort of really having these very

489
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:17.040
candid discussions about sex and
sexuality in media format yeah

490
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.119
um and not only that but in instances of
depicting sex also depicting safe and

491
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:24.960
healthy and consensual sex practices
that are more you know educational

492
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.740
through the context of being media
because all media is educational yeah um

493
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.800
it's developing a world that it wants to
see whether it's trying to do it or not

494
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.460
even Twilight was doing that it's it was
trying to create a world even every

495
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.040
Creator does that even if they don't
know they're doing it I mean that's yeah

496
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.520
every piece of media that's created is
trying to influence the world that the

497
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.880
Creator wants to see so yeah the Creator
needs to be very aware of what they're

498
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.359
trying to educate
um and good creators will do it in a way

499
00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:51.960
where people don't know they're being
educated so yeah that's uh the end of

500
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.520
the video I guess
um

501
00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.320
General sex positivity taking sex out of
the closet and saying this exists it

502
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.500
exists for physical reasons emotional
reasons there's no point in denying you

503
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.560
exist yeah stop pretending this doesn't
exist

504
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.240
stop pretending porn doesn't exist these
are things that are kind of essential to

505
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:18.420
society and I think that's what we need
to start doing and if we start doing

506
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:23.880
that I think it will lead to things that
will you know it might lead to a to kind

507
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.480
of booting out the politicians who want
to ban drag queens and stuff like that

508
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.140
because they see that as they will take
some kind of sexual interest because

509
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.619
that is all linked to set their
arguments have fundamentally sex is

510
00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:39.420
abnormal this thing is a sex fetish
thing therefore it is abnormal yeah even

511
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.280
a drag is not a sex fetish thing but you
know conservative yeah so thank you guys
