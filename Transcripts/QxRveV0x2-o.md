Yuri on Ice is a 2016 anime about Yuri Katsukai,

a 24 year old figure skater from Japan whose pretty much convinced that he’s past his

prime. Until his idol, world famous Russian figure Victor Nikiforov shows up in Yuri’s

small town to coach him into being a champion himself. I’ve been told for almost an entire year

that I need to watch Yuri On Ice. People on YouTube. People on Twitter. People on Facebook.

All telling me I need to watch it. That I’d love it, and that it’s super gay. When I

mentioned it to a few friends they were honestly shocked I hasn’t seen it. So, finally, begrudgingly,

I watched it. Spoilers ahead. And I want to be absolutely blunt, before

we get into this. I’ve made a kind of career here on YouTube talking about queer coding

in media. How gay characters are almost never shown, and just hinted at. And it’s incredibly

frustrating, queer coding that is. And I was warned before watching Yuri on Ice that it

was total queer bait, but I watched it anyway. And after watching both the sub’d and dub’d

versions, I can say that this is actually the kind of representation that I’ve been

asking for. Could it have used an on-screen kiss? I mean sure. The arm-in-front-of-mouth

felt a little forced when it’s abundantly clear what was going on. But… it didn’t really need two men kissing

in public. Because its queerness… wasn’t subtle at all. In fact the subtlety was lacking to such an

extent that it boggles my mind that there are fans online who argue that Yuri and Victor

are straight. Straight. Yes. Absolutely. This is… pique heterosexuality. Granted, the English voice dub is much more

homosexually explicit, whereas the subtitled version is less textual. Granted, a key component

of creative licence in Japanese media is for the audience to take implicit details for

granted. So, in the culture of media consumption in Japan, yes, those little gay cues are meant

to be read into. Going through it three times total, the gay…ness

of the whole thing became so much more apparent each time that the only way I can possibly

account for anyone saying that this is straight is a bunch of women and girls who are exercising

the most willful ignorance I’ve had the displeasure of being exposed to. Which, honestly,

if the complete lack of women in this sausage fest isn’t a tip off, the literal only textual

antagonist in this first season is one who refuses to stop shoving his heterosexual lifestyle

in everyone’s faces. I can understand why a lot of North American

viewers wouldn’t get the message though. There’s no grand, bombastic soapbox moment

where either Yuri or Victor stand in front of a crowd to declare their sexuality… except

the scene where Yuri declares his love for Victor on live TV. But besides that. And neither was there a whole media push to

promote these gay characters, in which the network and creator can pat themselves on

the back, Disney “first gay character” style. If a studio or network isn’t blasting their

own self-promotional circle-jerk across the internet, how do we know for certain that

a character is gay? And even if they are gay, how do we know it’s gay representation if

a giant, money-grubbing straight, family-values corporation isn’t telling a swarm of queers

that this is gay representation? How gay is gay enough for it to be gay… without us

having to be told it is? Now, I know what you’re thinking. I’ve

spent most of my tenure on YouTube railing against media producers for using copouts

when it comes to any kind of representation. Using the whole ‘it’s there if you look

for it’ queer coding and baiting doesn’t really fly with me in most cases. But at some point, the question of ‘how

gay is gay enough’ must become ‘why do we have to project our gay all the way to

the cheap seats in the back?’ How gay does something need to be for people

to appreciate it’s gayness? Not even that. At what point are people gonna

stop telling gay people what is or isn’t a gay experience? Because you have something, Yuri!!! On ICE,

in which the story benefits from subtlety. But apparently, we’re not allowed to have

nuanced depictions of gay experiences because unless we’re showing up on a pride float

weraring a leather harness and puppy hood, there’s a whole swath of people who will

insist we don’t exist. The thing is… rubbing our sexuality in everyone’s

faces just to prove we exist does get exhausting for us, and in order to prove our existence,

we get stuck in a cycle where our existence is based solely on our sexuality and sex.

And so, our existence is deemed not appropriate for all audiences. Victor shouldn’t NEED to have Yuri bent

over a bench in order to justify and demonstrate their sexual and romantic leanings when the

emotional simplicity is focused on a much more wholesome depiction. Mostly. To the point where… yeah I think this is

better queer representation than the overwhelming bulk of American films, television shows,

and even comic books have had to offer in recent memory. At which point before going on, I feel obliged

to erase any shadow of a doubt to confirm that, yes, even through inference only, this

is qualifiabley gay — and maybe even queer - representation. To The Network’s credit, they did everything

they could to keep as much of the gay out of Yuri!!! On ICE. From arms-in-front-of-kisses

to obscuring as much of the romantic details as possible. There’s no plausible deniability

that there are a slew of gay characters in this show… but it is possible. Not plausible,

but possible. Straights are great at that. As I mentioned, Japanese media is meant to

be read into — where heavy-handed details are generally frowned upon. What’s inferred

is meant to be taken for granted.Both Kristoff and Victor, almost naked, jumping

into Yuri’s bed in Barcelona itself is not meant to be dismissed as a ‘just friends

thing.’ After all, we here in continental America have a joke about male figure skaters

all being gay — I can’t imagine that there isn’t that reputation elsewhere. I’m comfortable

saying that the show’s displays of affection and romance are meant to co-incide with an

already-present expectation of male figure skaters. Because scenes like this, with no dialogue

contains a visual language which does not need translation. Seriously… this scene

was basically lifted from a 2000s Kate Hudson romance. Personally, as a visual learner, and a film

director, I’m a little disappointed that we are apparently so incapable of trusting

visual language here in the West. But that’s a whole other video on its own. Because the vast majority of queer content

in Yuri!!! On ICE is visual language. I mean… we’ve been demanding to be seen,

right? And if a gay person saying: “Hey, this is

a pretty gay experience” isn’t enough, there’s more than enough textual evidence

to indicate that this is a cast of gay and bi figure skaters. Except for JJ. The straights can have him. Because aside from the airport scene, the

engagement, and an overall comfort with nudity, Victor and Yuri routinely share a bed. And then there’s the repudiative public

almost-love declarations that are projected at the public during broadcasts. I mean I

get that dismantling toxic masculinity involves a process of making it acceptable to tell

your best bro that you love him, but there’s a difference between wanting the best for

your bro and wanting to $#^% him. The engagement scene, and it is an engagement

scene, is really the only part of the series that I disliked. It just reads like a no-homo

copout that the network made the creators slip in there. Probably as a compromise so

that they could have a gay engagement in the first place. But you also get a scene where two naked men

jump into Yuri’s bed and his only objection is about how cold their feet are. Which maybe

you could argue this is a straight boy thing, but then we’re getting desperately close

to the territory of staged straight-bait porn. And couple that with the yearning, the pining,

the numerous confessions, the hand, holding, the hugging, the emotional support crying,

the complete lack of female love interests. And like. Sure. Take a couple of these things

and you can argue that it’s straight? If you wanna be mean. Why do you want the gays to have FEWER icons?

Jesus. We can still get fired for being gay in most states, can you at least let us have

anime male figure skaters? But add all of it together and it simply does

not fit the bill for plausible deniability. And it’s not like Yuri and Victor are the

only queer ones— The show makes it abundantly clear when a

figure skater has alleged heterosexual inclinations. Also the… brother and sister who are…

very committed. But as for other characters… is it possible

for catboys to be straight? [Yurio with the ears.] No really, are there any straight catboys?

I’m curious. Aside from joking around, I can’t really

think of any other excuse for why a 15 year old, bereft of adult supervision, would so

vehemently flee a swarm of rabid fangirls only to wind up riding bitch for a hunky slav.

Followed by this scene. On a vista overlooking the sun setting and

everything. Come on. What more does it have to take? Why is it that not until boys are literally

putting their bodies together for skin-on-skin contact that some people will insist that

this type of situation is completely hetero. I’ve actually heard this is pretty bad for

sports anime. At which point I consider it a failure of

Western ’queer representation’, where Western audiences cannot recognize queer characters

by inference alone. And so… one has to wonder… what is causing

this denial in media analysis? What makes some American audiences require their media

to be so much more… explicit? Subtlety as a staple of Japanese storytelling

extends not only to modern media but also the mythological cycle, the very way in which

ancient Japanese historians recorded their legends, and then re-recorded those documents.

Small gentures, like nods or turning one’s head slightly, were recorded in detail, and

were meant to signify a clear, nonverbal message. Which not only was used to characterize the

individuals in the story, whether fiction, history, or fictionalized history, but to

explain and justify the actions of characters or figures. In many instances, a piece of media is meant

to be read into. This isn’t to say that every piece of Japanese media is meant to

be subtle and deeply enriching. But this does say that this is an audience

that has been conditioned to seek out smaller inferences and put it into the context of

the work as a whole. An audience which is conditioned to be aware that all aspects of

a given piece of fiction are placed there deliberately by the creator, and therefore

are meant to ask why that is. And as a result, in order to fully appreciate the media, you,

the observer, are invited to extract details. That’s one of the reasons fandom culture

is so intense in Japan. So… scenes which are implicitly romantic

in setting, emotional context, and body language seem out of place in an anime which is seemingly

exclusively about figure skating. Why is that? No really, would it not seem super weird to

dedicate so much time and energy to depicting the ‘platonic’ relationship between a

figure skater and a coach in such a sensual way in straight media? As far as implicit

gay content goes, Yuri!!! On ICE has the writing written more clearly on the wall than some

explicit queer content. Due to the complexity of the models and expressions,

there is greater permission for more of the story and characters to exist in visual language.

Because visual language does not require a translation, I’d also be willing to say

this is a significant reason for the growing global popularity of Anime. This is especially true when we factor in

an over-arching element of Japanese culture, which is much more reserved when it comes

to public displays of affection — at least next to America. And especially next to Switzerland. However, as I mentioned, audiences conditioned

to expect American media to be very blunt are at the same time more cynical, and unwilling

to read into the subtext of a given property. The english voice-dub of Yuri!!! On ICE is

much more explicit in it’s depictions of queerness — which matches the sensibilities

of audiences in Americanized nations. And I’m not trying to say that one version of

Yuri!!! On ICE is better than the other. Honestly the difference in translation is so subtle,

that it isn’t that noticeable. The instances of visual language make up the bulk of queer

coding in either version. American audiences though, are far more conditioned

to overt messaging. Cue another person who thinks that Fightclub is a celebration of

toxic masculinity. And I mean it’s not really our fault. Euro-American

media as a whole seems to be driven more and more towards an elimination of nuance. Whether

that’s because of Hollywood or whether Hollywood has been responding to and demand. But it

seems that American media has been edging more and more towards a situation where the

audience is encouraged to do as little as possible to engage with their media. I hear stories about people going to movie

theatres in America, and am a little shocked to hear just how… frequently people will

have whole conversations while a movie is going on, or just be on their phone. I don’t

know how you guys function. Where I am, being in a movie theatre is kinda… sacred. You’re

there to watch a movie, not to have a conversation. And put your damn phone away. Granted, this culture of movie-theatre discussions

go back to the beginning of movie theatres in general, where people in city centres would

escape summer heat in cinemas — one of the only structures at the time that was air-conditioned.

A necessity due the to flammability of early nitrate based film. And, as people weren’t necessarily paying

attention to what was on the screen, a film would still be received negatively by movie

goers if they didn’t know what was going on or if they didn’t pick up on certain

details. This lead to a trend in films to reach for grand spectacles instead of nuanced

character dramas. Enter Cecil B Demill and his biblical epics. It wasn’t until the 60s that acting, plots,

and direction style shifted to a more natural, humanistic level of expression. The film version

of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woof’ was a marked shift in popular styles of filmmaking

towards a more subtle style of realistic nuance. Coupled with the american culture of consuming

Television programming, and entertainment was very much something that was there to

be on in the background while people went about their lives. Repeating information to

make sure that the message got across. That’s why so many TV shows actually repeat the last

bit of the last scene after a commercial break. To this day. And it wasn’t until recently in American

Television that shows were designed for you to pick up on subtlety, with examples like

Arrested Development, the first few seasons of Game of Thrones, and especially Breaking

Bad. It may go deeper than Hollywood though. Compare

Japanese mythological storytelling conventions to ‘western’ ones. Modern stories, in

one way or another, are always constructed on the foundation of ancient mythological

cycles. For this, European stories were made on a tradition stemming from Roman and Greek

poems, as well as Abrahamic parables. In either case, the narrative convention of

these styles very much lean towards the explicit. Dialogue is over-rought, clear in it’s delivery,

with the intention to convey complete meaning in the spoken word alone. Though… it’s

really hit or miss with that. Turns out that after 2500 years of the bible, some of the

old meaning has been lost in translation. European theatrical conventions also focused

exclusively on an actor’s ability to deliver lines, and what the lines themselves say.

In the Elizabethan era, it was common to simply not have a set or props for a given production.

And so, some of you may have noticed that Shakespeare goes to great lengths to have

his actors describe what a given set looks like, what the weather is like, how dark it

is. The responsibility of the actors was not to show this via acting, but telling via dialogue.

They couldn’t really afford to “show don’t tell” until film came along. Compare and contrast to a Japanese performance

art like Kabuki… which has markedly less dialogue and which the audience is more encouraged

to read into how a given performer is carrying themselves, their gestures, their expressions.

How they move. Why they move. A single look can mean as much as, or more than, a Shakespearean

sonnet. That’s why a lot of Western audiences really

don’t get why people love ballet and fashion. That’s ALL show and no tell. In both of

those cases — they are not seen as ‘accessable’ because most people have not developed the

sensibilities needed to analyze how well a given balerina is pretending to be a swan. So yes, among Western audiences there is an

expectation that media will hold their hand and guide them through every element of the

plot. Thought process being ‘if the creator wants me to know about something in their

media, they will tell me that it is important.’ Hitchcock famously got around this by SHOWING

you something important three times, but not necessarily talking about it even once. That

way it’s hard to miss but he’s not spilling the whole mystery for the viewers who are

actually paying attention. Conversely, the argument for nuance goes:

‘if the creator has something important to say in this media, they will reward me

by letting me figure it out for myself.’ Basically the golden rule of David Lynch. Which way is better? Depends on the storyteller,

the story, and the audience. There’s actually been a centuries-long debate

within art criticism. Do we, as art critics, observe the work as it was intended, only

factoring in the cultural attitudes that the author was deliberately feeding into their

art. Or do we analyze in spite of the author’s intentions, factoring other iconographic connections

that the author was not necessarily intending, but that enriches the work nevertheless. Many authors, in biographies and interviews

will often speak to assumptions of their work: symbolic value, allegory, allusion — and

oftentimes they admit that what is being read into their work was never intended. For instance,

after being consistently questioned on the feminist power of Carrie, Stephen King admitted

that he had never intended for it to be viewed under such a feminist lens. Instead, he said that after reading his first

draft, he noticed a reoccurring pattern of blood. And in subsequent drafts, highlighted

these elements further. The result was a story which, under a certain interpretation, spoke

to a way that women find power because of and in spite of suffering. Does King’s lack of deliberate intention

diminish the art or the artist? I would argue: no. The ability for an artist

to focus on developing a good story, while subliminally including elements that speak

to a culture at large is an outstanding talent. And sadly, many who have this talent are often

plagued with lifelong inadequacy issues, imposter complexes, and frequently opt to give up before

they hit their stride because others hold them up against artists who appear to do it

all seamlessly… Those who, also, would have openly admitted to not having the slightest

clue what they’re doing, but happen to do the right thing so nobody bothers to ask. And in this respect, Yuri!!! On ICE exists

as a triumph of gay representation. Before it set out to do anything, it was going to

tell a good story. Where most stories function around telling people how to succeed, Yuri!!!

On ICE was primarily about how not to give up. Really, the nail in the coffin should have

been the direct message from the creator. “Yuri and Victor are gay, and in a relationship.”

She said that— So that really should be the end of it. We’re

not gonna do anything else to talk about why Victor and Yuri are queer. It’s a thing.

Be mad. But… Japan has certain laws, such as what

time of night a queer-centric show can be aired on TV. This show was slated for an earlier

timeslot in the night because its first a foremost a sports anime. In order for the

quiet part to be as loud as the creator wanted, it would have have to air much later at night

than the network wanted. Probably not reach as wide an audience because of it, and definitely

not have the same amount of advertising behind it. What the creator did with presenting an obviously

gay story while still appeasing the censorship regulations was… just an all round masterclass

in network trolling. She had a gay thing that was, more or less approved for all ages— —And wanted to project it out to as large

an audience as possible, while still preserving the queer elements of the story. So, she had

to compromise her artistic vision, appease the network demands, and develop a quality

program that would appeal to audiences. The easiest thing to do in this situation

would be to develop a token straight love interest for Yuri and/or Victor. That way,

with heterosexuality confirmed, the creator would have a lot more leeway from the studio

to do what she wanted. But instead, and I strongly approve of this, she coded elements

of queerness so strongly that they are absolutely unmissable, and yet, she can argue to the

network that it matches the straight-leaning sensibility of network standards. I don’t know how much you know about show

business but being able to do that without sacrificing the integrity of the project is

absolutely incredible. As a comparison of how things can go terribly wrong, Nickelodeon

fought tooth and nail against the creative team of Legend of Korra, who wanted to present

a queer woman of colour. Which were, at the time, three words that the network did not

want to hear in a pitch. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, there

was little effort made to code Korra as ‘queer’ — maybe it was even a studio note to force

Korra into a number of Love triangles with other men, and a continuing on-again-off-again

relationship with a male supporting character. Eventually going so far as to push the final

seasons of the show onto their web only platform because they knew Korra and Asami were going

to hold hands in the final shot and, well, we can’t put that on TV, now can we? And that isn’t to say that Yuri!!! On ICE

did not suffer it’s own managerial problems. There were insane deadlines on the animation

department so the skating scenes suffer from some painful frame drops, the script for each

episode was roughly twice as long as the network permitted, so a lot of character development

for smaller characters had to be dropped. And it very well may be that the more explicit

gay content had to be cut for time constrains as well as network appeasement. And yet, the creative team very masterfully

used the time resources they had to advance the already-constricted plot at the same time

as dropping some gay bombs. And, maybe even as a happy accident, used nuance to their

advantage to make queer content that benefitted from having no explicit discussion of homosexuality. Because Yuri!!! On ICE is not about queerness.

It’s about queer people, but it’s not about qualifying the validity of their personhood

based on their capacity for queerness. Their queerness is neither the first nor the second

thing that comes to mind when discussing their roles in the plot, and the roles they have

to other characters. This includes the relationship between Victor

and Yuri. And this isn’t to say you aren’t meant

to see the queerness, nor that this story is not meant to be seen as a love story. But

it is meant to say that the characters have a purpose beyond letting the audience know

that they’re here and they’re queer. Because, speaking from my experiences as a gay person,

I can safely say that ‘being gay’ is not what’s on my mind most of the time. I don’t

feel the need to qualify my gayness either to a partner, family or the rest of society. In the same way, Yuri and Victor do not need

to have an exchange that goes along the lines of: “But… I’m a boy like you! W-why are

you holding my hand!?!” “Ever since I was young… I knew I was

different… and I was drawn to you because… you’re also different — like I saw in

myself years ago!” They know they’re gay. They don’t need

to have a heart-to-heart about it because that does not benefit them, as characters.

Doing so is only to benefit an audience and would, as a result, break the emotional realism

of the scene. And in doing so this speaks to a queer experience

that is much more realistic, and identifiable. And so, by keeping the queerness coded — ironically

— this moves closer into an experience that is intended to be appreciated by queer people.

Rather than presenting a queer experience for the intention of being consumed by straight

people. In fact, the lack of clarity also affords

a, perhaps accidental instance of nonbinary representation, specifically from Yuri. As

per elements of the show, he is much more comfortable skating his programs as a woman. He spares no expense to clarify that he feels

like he doesn’t belong with the other men, and any time the word ‘man’ is used in

the entirety of the show, it is always in a period of great anxiety for Yuri himself. Victor also started out his career looking

very androgynous, bending the separation between male and female, if not shattering it. So at this point I ask myself — what is

the difference between representation, coding, pandering, and baiting? And is drawing a distinction

necessary? After all, it would be unfair to act like Yuri on Ice is the only piece of

media ever produced to have subtle queer representation. The problem is that in most other cases, the

representation isn't so much subtle as it is simply not acknowledged. It would be easy

to just drop my series of queer baiting videos right here, but there’s been a few movies

that have come out since then that I’d rather talk about. We’ll drop them into two categories.

Queer representation, and Queer Pandering. See if you can tell which is which. Disney’s Cruella. I wasn’t sure what to expect from Cruella,

to be honest. Disney was already trumpeting it as their “First Out Gay Character”,

the third or forth such character in the last few years, so I was preparing myself for a

big ole eye roll. But it never came.  The gay character in question, Arty, a fashionista

who helps Cruella create her devilish looks throughout the film, didn’t silently pine

over any of the male characters, wasn’t abused for his queerness, and didn’t exist

just to give Cruella someone to talk to. He was active in the plot, helping her create

the looks she would use to bring down her rival The Baronesse, performs live on stage

at an impromptu Cruella fashion show, and isn’t just forgotten when the plot moves

past him. In the closing scenes of the film he’s among Cruella’s crew. Jasper and

Horace are there, of course, but so is Arty. Meaning he’s probably coming back for the

sequel Disney currently has in development. Now plenty of queer people have pointed out

that it’s never stated in that he is in fact gay, which is true. But he’s pure camp,

with his Bowie inspired looks, and even talks about being beaten up for being different.

He doesn’t say he’s gay, or show romantic interest in any other characters, but nobody

does. Though Jasper might have a crush on Cruella, she doesn’t seem to reciprocate,

and it could easily be read a brother/sister type of situation. Jasper’s heterosexuality

is just as subtle as Arty’s homosexuality. Cruella, on the other hand, never even gives

a longing look to anything that isn’t fabric. Leading me to believe that maybe, just maybe,

Cruella might fall onto the ACE spectrum. Which, if she was still a puppy killer would

be pretty bad ACE representation. But as it seems she’s reformed her ways from Disney’s

last version of her to this one, she’s less bad guy and more bad ass.  So the queerness is Cruella is subtle, and

does require the audience to understand at least a bit of the history of camp and androgyny,

but it’s some of the better queer rep I’ve seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie, especially

from Disney. I’m sure they’ll eliminate my current good will once they release that

River Cruise movie though.  Next!

Ah, more Disney.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. The live action one. Now this ones been discussed to death. LeFou,

the gay under our microscope here, is just bad representation. Firstly, his name literally

means “The Fool”, so hurray us. Secondly, he pines after the biggest jock in town, whose

an absolute asshole to everyone including him. As if we never grow out the bad habits

we pick up in grade school. His character is a villain until he’s suddenly not. When

he suddenly has a change of heart, has a heart to heart with Mrs Pots about Gaston, and realizes

he deserves a better boyfriend. Or at least someone better to pine over.  So he ends up dancing with, or at least embracing,

one of the townies we spotted for a split second earlier in the film. This was Disney’s

“Exclusively gay” moment, by the way. Something that the films director, out gay

filmmaker Bill Condon, played up in the press for literally months beforehand. Creating

much controversy from parents groups and much anticipation from gay fans. After all, Beauty

and the Beast was Howard Ashmen’s swan song before his untimely death from complications

due to AIDS, so it would be a fitting tribute to him to finally put a real gay character

in a Disney movie. And then the scene happened and the audience said… that was it? Yes, that was it. Like Star Wars The Rise

of Skywalker would do two years later, the exclusive gay moment was a blink and you miss

it shot, not SCENE, a shot.  But enough about Disney. I don’t expect

anything wonderfully gay to come from the Mouse House anytime soon. And no, a sexless

married gay superhero with kids in a minor supporting role in The Eternals does not count.

I said good representation, not boring representation. So let’s talk about some real gay super

heroes. THE OLD GUARD

The Old Guard was a 2020 Netflix action movie about a group of functionally immortal bad

asses. They think they’re the last of their kind but when a new one pops up, seemingly

out of nowhere, it leads to a race against time to keep her safe from a conniving capitalist

swine.  Two of the aforementioned immortal badasses

are a gay couple. Joe and Nicky. Characters whose sexuality is so subtle at first its

literally in the background, out of focus. Early on in the film you’re not even likely

to notice the knowing looks they give each other, or even notice them spooning in the

back of a scene. But then BAM, they’re kidnapped and their lives are seemingly in danger so

they declare their literally undying love for one another. And goddammit it works. This

crazy, over the top action movie that would make some of the Fast and Furious movies look

subtle has, hands down, the best gay representation I’ve ever seen in a Hollywood movie. The

gays don’t die. They’re not depressed about being gay. Nobody wants to kill them

for being gay. It’s just… a thing they are. Something that has, really, nothing to

do with the plot. They could have been straight buds but, instead, they’re gay. They just

happen to be gay. And it is perfect. Unlike most gay characters they survive to the end

and will be in the sequel, which Netflix green-lit earlier this year. The movie was a huge success

for Netflix and other than gay media, almost nobody mentioned Joe and Nicky. Why? Because

Netflix didn’t put out a press release declaring “WE HAVE A GAY! TWO OF EM!” They just let the gays exist like they would

any straight character. They were just there. Their queerness completely incidental to the

plot, just like every other characters straightness. I was so shocked by this that I barely knew

what to think when I watched it. An action movie with gay characters. An action movie

with gay heroes? An action movie with gay heroes who don’t die? WHAT IS THIS? Opposite land?! Did the pandemic

cause a new reality to open up? Sadly, no. No new reality, just a single ripple

in spacetime that felt a bit different. Not a whole lot of incidentally gay characters

popping up in action movies since then. But one did come out just before it: The Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation

of one Harley Quinn DC and Warner Bros managed to make a good

movie and then cancelled the sequel. Color me surprised. This rollercoaster of colorful sets, audacious

costumes, bonkers action, and off the cuff queer references (Harley is confirmed to have

dated women even before the opening title) was the last movie I saw in theatres before

the pandemic hit. And it was a hell of a ride to go out on.  Now, as a movie news nerd I followed the production

of Birds of Prey pretty closely. So I knew that WB actually sent this thing back for

reshoots at least once because they decided, late in the game, that a certain plot point

was a bit too risque for them. You see, originally, Ewan McGregor’s Black Mask was 100% confirmed

to be gay in the movie, and the reason he was after the Bertinelli diamond wasn’t

for the money, but because it contained data inside. Data that, when read, would reveal

him in compromised positions. And his dick pics.  I’m not kidding.  Black Mask, or Roman Sianos, was a bit of

a kinky bottom you see. And heaven help the woman who let that info leak out to the rest

of Gotham’s underworld. But WB got cold feet and called for reshoots.

Simplifying the plot and vaguely straight washing Roman and his serial killing henchman

/ dom top, Victor Zazz. Oh the movie we could have had if it weren’t for corporate meddling. But the queerness of the couple is still abundantly

clear. Roman never says he’s queer but when he’s rocking a pink silk kimono while dancing

around with a martini, I don’t think it needs be remarked.  Ewan McGregor's acting has a campy quality

to it that reminds me of villain in a John Waters movie. Now, the queer community doesn’t

really like queer coded villains these days, which is pretty understandable. But in this

case, exceptions can and should be made.  Some of the Birds of Prey media discussion

was focused on how the film despises men or portrays white men as villains. That isn't

entirely accurate, but the film does have a slew of terrible men with a similar appearance.

What interests me about this is that Roman and Victor are examples of these evil men.

They aren't macho clichés of men, and they don't sexualize the female characters in the

film. Roman shifting into the Black Mask persona and forcing a woman to pull off her clothing

is one example where it doesn't feel like he's doing it for the sexual thrills, but

for the control. He also didn't want the dress in his club because it was a crime against

fashion. And unlike murder, some laws should never be broken. (but fashion has changed

- no it hasnt - serial mom clip) So is Black Mask GOOD representation of queer

men? No, of course not. But is he an interesting character with more going for him than just

being the gay character. Yes. And that’s what we need. We need characters who are MORE

than just the gay one. This puts me in a difficult situation, as

it may not be clear what I’m advocating for. On one hand, I’m praising various instances

of subtlety in media when it comes to queer representation, while condemning other attempts

to make more ‘overtly’ queer media. But what I’m saying is that we don’t necessarily

need to chose between one or the other. Our representation would get boring if we,

as a group, decided that there was only one way to represent us. In that case, it would

be a gross disservice to the vast range of diversity in the queer experience. There isn’t

one way to be queer — there isn’t even one way to be gay. But my problem with ‘explicit’

representation in modern media is that you wouldn’t know that from the way we are represented. Maybe in thise case, it’s best to focus

less on depicting queer instances— —and instead place that focus on depicting

queer experiences. Making sure we push queer characters into

fiction doesn’t seem to be having the desired effect of having our people and communities

seen. As the end result is a matter of taking queer characters and making their motives

and backgrounds indistinguishable from straight characters. Reminiscent of saying we deserve

gay marriage because we’re ‘just like’ heterosexual couples. We aren’t. We have

different social experiences with society at large. Our coming-of-age experiences, as they fit

outside the projected norm, are not the norm. And depicting queer characters as being ‘straight

characters but gay’ is a disservice to the way that the process of self-discovery and

independence shapes us. We’re NOT like everyone else. And that’s

what we should be proud of. We’re not even always like each other — and it should be

our diversity that society at large values as our most significant strength. Not our ability to buy a house in the suburbs

in a prestigious school district. Because while we’re busy showing how much

gay people are ‘just like’ straight people, We’re forgetting about the boss-ass bitch

queers who have only ever found acceptance by being better than literally everyone else.

So much so that they can’t find where their performance ends and they begin. The angry queers who feel like they’re only

worth something if they’re validated by the established order, instead of finding

worth in themselves. And the personal improvement queers who struggle

to figure out what it is they have to offer the world. Our stories, our experiences, our lives are

interesting and relevant. And if you tell an interesting story about a queer person,

audiences will cheer for them. Which is what made me love this show. It represents

the queer community, specifically queer men, in a way that I very rarely see. And that

being... that there are many different types of queer people. Insecure ones like Yuri. Perfectionists like

Victor. People who want to be center stage, and people who just want to blend in. Those

of us who are comfortable in our skin, and those who are still working on things. Masculine

or Feminine. Supportive or Competitive. Tender or painfully horny. We come in many different

shapes and sizes. Skin colors, religious backgrounds, nationalities, and beliefs. But at our best, like the skaters in Yuri

on Ice, we are, at the end of the day, a community. There to help one another, and push each other

when we need it. So anytime you feel small or lost or ignored… like you’re not good

enough. Like you don’t fit in. Think about the queer people who came before us. The artists.

The politicians. The power brokers. The creators. The writers. The teachers. The brothers and

sisters. The good friends. Who changed things, who told stories, who made an impact. Because they’re important. We’re important,

we’re significant, and we were born to make history.
