surface level reading of Dos is that he is either a god a reflection of a god a prince who died ages ago or a collection of household insects given material form by anthy depending on the version of your story now yes if you want to you can look at him like that and that who he was is now a Spector that resides in the sword Andor Castle he is the figure who gave utena her signant ring and inspired her to become a prince and he is not AIO though can be read as and is occasionally a reflection of AIO for all that dios is approached with the language of the Christian God akio's name is derived from a Japanese character used in the name for Venus the Morning Star which is associated with Lucifer Lucifer which is dare I say a misappropriated name for Satan Lucifer instead originally referred to a Persian God Of The Morning Light and Satan actually means the accuser not the devil he was God's prosecutor not his enemy Frenemies but anyway religion and anime fun
