Over the last several years there have been demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood movies. But something that many people don’t know is that the first movie to ever win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, was also <mark x num=1>the first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss</mark>. 

<mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark>’s film *Wings*. Released <mark num=3>in 1927</mark>. In "Wings," <mark>two World War I aviators</mark> <mark>compete for the affections of the same woman while coming to terms with their growing feelings for one another. Despite being labeled a "friendship" for the duration of the film</mark> (perhaps to circumvent censorship requirements), <mark>it is evident that these two men are developing romantic feelings for one another</mark>. Made clear by the climactic <mark>dramatic kiss</mark>. 

<mark x>Wellman's silent film captures one of the earliest examples of LGBTQ</mark> cinema <mark x>by carefully toeing the censorship line</mark>; the film examines the expressed passions of two men entangled in the conflict of WWI and the emotional torment of a forbidden connection. 

<mark x>*Wings* went on to be a box office smash</mark>, and even at a time when the film industry was quickly transitioning to sound, became the only truly silent film <mark x>to win Best Picture</mark>.

Confirmed: The winner of the [First Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Academy_Awards)'s (then) "Outstanding Picture" category was [Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_(1927_film)).

Prior to the Production Code, LGBT characters were somewhat prevalent, if heavily stereotyped and exploited, in a number of major films. The 1920s especially were a time of shifting societal norms and expanding artistic experimentation. As women rode the first wave of feminism and prohibition was increasingly challenged, filmmakers began to expand their boundaries and feature more controversial plotlines. This set the stage for *Wings* which was directed by <mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark> <mark num=3>in 1927</mark> and featured what is considered <mark x num=1>the first gay kiss in an American film</mark>.

Wings follows <mark>two Air Force pilots in World War I,</mark> Jack and Dave, who <mark>compete for the affections of a beautiful girl before discovering the true love they feel for each other. While the relationship is referred to repeatedly as a friendship</mark>, the acting and directing of the film make <mark>it obvious that the men’s feelings were romantic</mark>. The storyline ends when one of the men is fatally injured. He dies in his lover’s arms after a <mark>passionate kiss</mark>. Despite the condemnation of gay men in society as a whole at this time period, the film is surprisingly respectful of love between the two characters (Denesi). The camera remains mostly still in a tight shot of Jack and Dave embracing as they share a final goodbye. Jack assures Dave as he nears death that nothing meant more to him than their relationship. A swell of romantic string instruments play in the background as Jack mourns over Dave’s still body. The directing choices made by Wellman humanized both characters and allowed the audience to experience the tragedy without exploiting the perceived exoticness of a relationship between two men. <mark x>This film is exemplary of many films featuring gay characters in the 1920s</mark>. Wellman escaped criticism over his inclusion of gay characters <mark x>by very carefully walking the line</mark> between friends and lovers. To anyone not paying close attention, Jack and Dave could easily pass as close friends. <mark x>The movie was incredibly well-received</mark> and was <mark x>chosen as Best Picture for the 1927–1928 cycle</mark>. However, not all films featuring LGBT characters handled the issue as sensitively as *Wings*. One of the earliest kisses featuring two women was featured in Morocco, a 1930 film directed by Josef Von Sternberg.

But *Wings* is actually not where our story begins. The history of Hollywood has always had an asterisk beside it. Hidden in the footnotes in tiny little print, are the queer actors, filmmakers, executives, and tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from a backwater orange grove in California to the city in which thousands of young dreamers make their way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a long story. And like most classic American tales… it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

This discussion of gay men shouldn’t suggest that lesbians didn’t also get attention. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">In the film ‘Pandora's Box,’ which was originally shown in Germany in 1929, there is a figure who is most likely the first lesbian on screen to be portrayed overtly. The film presented the story of the great unrequited love and passion between two women, the countess Geschwitz and the lady she is enamored with, Lulu.</span>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Although the love that Geschwitz feels for Lulu is referred to as ‘sterile’ within the context of the movie, it is a driving force in the action, and it makes the introduction of a sapphic passion onscreen an exciting and historical cinematic event.</span> An event American audiences likely would never know of. British censors deleted the character of Countess Geschwitz from the film before prints were sent <ins>off</ins> to America. Though original German prints *did eventually* make it across the pond in the 1960s.

When it comes to *American-made* gay characters, one of the earliest direct references to homosexuality was a parody. Which is… predictable, I suppose.

This is one of the first examples of the use of the ‘harmless sissy’ image to present homosexuality in film. But in the context of rough-and-tough men in the soon-to-be industry-dominant western genre, we were laying the foundations of the trope from the word ‘GO.’ 

There is a very overt connection between the effeminate and apparent homosexual in this film. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Even though the cowboy was not supposed to be impersonating a woman, the primping and fussing characteristics that he displayed were unmistakably those of a woman.</span> At least as men at the time expected women to act.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">The comedy here was highlighting how out-of-place this sissy boy was in this rough-and-tumble world of the men who won the west.</span> The irony of course is that… there is *significant* historical evidence to suggest that the west was in fact RIFE with gay men (many from Europe) and was largely settled by women in sex work. 

However even though *The Soilers* is a mockery of queerness, among other things, the use of satire indicates that Homosexuality, especially in the context of it existing in traditionally masculine spaces, *was* on the mind of the public at large.

However, this was precisely the kind of event that the censors were keeping an eye out for. Public Ordinances already enabled censoring organizations around the country to look at pictures in advance of their public showing. Although all of those such entities had little *actual* authority, their rules for morality in the movies clearly mentioned ‘sex perversion’ as a key "don’t". Even if queerness was the subject of ridicule. 

The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1915: 

> “The exhibition of motion pictures is business, pure and simple and is conducted for-profit, like other spectacles not to be regarded or intended to be regarded as a part of the presence of the nation or the organs of public opinion."

This decision meant that movies were not protected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. Due to this ruling, harsh censorship legislation was eventually enacted in the states of New York, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia within a <ins>just</ins> few years following this judgment.

The gold standard in the United States was in the New York statute that was passed in 1921. It stated that: 

> “A film should be licensed by the state, unless such a film or a part thereof is of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals or incite crime.”

Indecency, immorality, and obscenity were nowhere described or defined in the statute, and thus there was considerable latitude for interpretations. Essentially giving free reign to wealthy, white, right-wing, Christian men to dictate what could and could not be in any given film released in these states. 

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">One of the first instances of lesbians kissing on screen was in a brief orgy scene in Cecil B DeMille's ‘Manslaughter’ in 1922.</span> The vision of two passionate women locked in a forbidden embrace, was used by DeMille to *condemn* the excesses of sex <span visual=none on="?" off="?">that he was portraying so graphically, and excessively.</span>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">The censors were *horrified* by *‘Salome,’* a 1923 film with a reportedly *all* queer cast made in tribute to Oscar Wilde.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">American censors became even more potent in the late 1920s and early 30s.

But while censorship laws were becoming more specific, their outlook on *gay* representation was kept vaguely broad. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">You didn’t need two men or women kissing to get banned.</span> Cross dressing, weakness or softness in male characters, and even *overly intellectual* male characters were enough to draw the ire of censors.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Will Hayes was appointed president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America — or MPPDA — in the late 1920s. Hayes served as both an elder in the Presbyterian church and as a former Postmaster General of the United States. That was the extent of his qualifications.</span> 

The organization was established primarily with the goals of fostering positive public relations for the studios and shielding the business from the potential for more restrictions from the outside world, <span visual=none on="?" off="?">which they mostly achieved in 1930 when the motion picture production code, which served as the basis for the industry's self-regulation and censorship, was actually written.</span>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">When the code was strengthened in 1934 under *intense* pressure from the Catholic Church,</span> even gently alluded gay characters began to disappear. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">The image of the film business as being harsh and manly, with no tolerance for foolishness,</span> <span visual=none on="?" off="?">was in continual conflict with the industry's reputation for being effeminate.</span> <span visual=none on="?" off="?">The censors used the ‘sissy’ archetype to target on-screen characters, using it as a thinly-veiled scapegoat to put pressure on a relatively *progressive* media industry which had been a safe haven for queer creators of all types up to then.</span> 

But filmmakers knew how to skirt the censors in many cases. The fact that most early movie ‘sissies’ were only gay if one chose to see them as being gay was simply a reflection of the fact that the existence of queer people in society was acknowledged only when society chose to do so. Instead of being overtly queer — characters like, say, the femme cowboy from *The Soilers*,were viewed as symbols for ‘failed’ masculinity, rather than actual homosexuals. And so they were allowed to stick around.

<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Most ‘sissies’ during the reign of the code were not necessarily demeaned, nor were they used in cruel or offensive ways. It was not the sissy, but what he *stood for* that was offensive. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Some actors created memorable galleries of gossipy snoops and snippy shopkeepers, who were often a little on the innocent side. But not always.</span>

Gays were also associated with dangerous revolutionaries hiding beneath the surface of normal society. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">The ghetto was one otherworld in which gay characters might frequently be seen on-screen *before* and *after* the reign of the Motion Picture Production Code. This represented the reality of the majority of Gay experiences at the time, which had been restricted to manifestations in slums of one kind or another. The underground life as a shelter for gays is a common theme.</span>

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">In many instances, the gay ghetto has been linked to the criminal underground. This is due to the fact that whenever there is an increase in illegal activity of *any* kind, even homosexuality, organized crime moves in to take control of the situation and make a profit. </span>(Though it should be noted that organized crime functions VERY differently than Hollywood often depicts, and in some cases, especially from the 40s and onward, can be beneficial to growing a community and preventing gentrification and climbing rental rates.) 

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Though as far as Hollywood played into misconceptions of criminal behavior, homosexuals were widely considered to be a criminal group,</span> which differentiated them from other types of minority groups. Crime rates might be high in some majority non-white areas, but just being a person of color was not, itself, *technically* illegal. (Though representatives and law enforcement may act otherwise.)

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">The film ‘Blood Money,’ released in 1933, showed a great deal of ambiguous sexual tension in a wider underworld. In the movie, the existence of homosexuality is openly acknowledged in the subculture that is a shelter on the fringes of acceptable society. In the film, Sandra Shaw is featured in several sequences as a fun-loving blonde who likes men's clothes.</span> 

At one point in the film, her boyfriend is preparing for a date along with his sister, a nightclub owner, who warns him about the kind of women he's running with, but he waves her fears aside.

Though he gets what she means, and *protests*, <span visual=none on="?" off="?">later in the film Shaw turns up again in a tweed jacket, this time with another woman in tow.</span> 

Movies like this were what led to further intensification of censorship in the mid 1930s. In addition to strengthening the Code, Will Hays reacted to criticism by inserting morality clauses into the contracts of actors, and compiled a "doom book" of 117 names of those deemed "unsafe" because of their personal lives. Homosexuality was denied as fervently *off-screen* as it was on, a literally unspeakable part of the culture.

Hollywood has always been more restrained on the screen than in real life. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">In “blood money” homosexuality is just another pocket of an underworld that exists outside the law.</span> Sexual connotations often surrounded the attitude of powerful men toward hired boys, or servile companions. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Although the villainous character of Joel Cairo in “The Maltese Falcon,” is identified by Sam Spade's secretary in the *novel*</span> as homosexual, <span visual=none on="?" off="?">the film version, instead, just turns him into a perfume wearing, cane kissing, ‘sissy’ with lace hankies.</span>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Elisha Cook jr. as Sidney Greenstreet's bodyguard Wilmer, however, is *implicitly* homosexual. He is referred to as "sonny," "boy" and "kid," and Bogart derisively calls him a "gunsel."</span> Since about 1915, prisoners had used the German word gunsel to mean a bottom, especially young inexperienced *criminal* bottoms. All of this was meant to connect the queer underworld with the underworld run, *mostly*, by the Sicillian mafia who, due to movies like Scarface and Public Enemy, were roundly feared across the country. 

This “fear the queer” mindset was brought to its *logical* conclusion in the horror films of the 1930s, <span visual=none on="?" off="?">where gays appeared as predatory, twilight creatures with a sense of style. The equation of horror with the sins of the flesh is easily seen in monster movies of the period. Creatures like Frankenstein’s monster and Count Dracula were almost always linked with the baser instincts of human beings.</span> The essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness permeates the depiction of gay characters in horror films.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">In *Dracula's Daughter*, Countess Maria Zalesca has a special attraction to women, a preference that was even highlighted in some of the original ads for the film. </span>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Queer parallels in 1931’s ‘Frankenstein’ and its 1935 sequel, ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’</span> arose from a vision both films had of the monster as an impossible, antisocial figure in the same way that gay people were "things" that should not have happened.

In both films, the homosexuality of director James Whale may have been the spark of the vision. Robert Aldrich, director of camp progenitor: ‘Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,’ recalls that:

> ”Jimmy Whale was the first guy who was blackballed because he refused to stay in the closet. 
>
> Mitchell Leisen and all those other guys played it straight, and they were onboard, but Whale said, “f*ck it, I'm a great director and I don't have to put up with this bullshit!"

> And he was a great director, not just a company director. And he was just unemployed after that...  
> Never worked again.” 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It should be noted that many articles on James Whale do not reference his refusal to be closeted, nor the Hayes Code in general, as a reason for the decline of his career. In spite of available first-hand testimonials demonstrating that it wasn’t just a contributing factor — that it was THE main reason. 

And Aldrich, who WAS a company director, if not an incredibly good one, would have been in-the-know about what producers and studio heads were saying behind the scenes.

<james {% include timecode %}>

According to Aldrich, an obviously lesbian director like Dorthy Arzner got away with her lifestyle because she was officially closeted. A gay woman keeping her ‘lifestyle’ on the sly was fine because “it made her one of the boys.” But a man who, like Whale, openly admitted to his loving relationship with another man, in this case producer David Lewis, did not stand a chance. 

Although James Whale <del>worked</del><ins>did work</ins> again briefly in 1943, he fell into obscurity soon after. In 1957 he was found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Frankenstein’s monster was the creation that would eventually destroy its creator </span>just as Whale’s own ‘aberration’ would eventually destroy his career. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">The monster in ‘Frankenstein’ bears the brunt of society's reaction to his existence, and in the sequel, the bride of Frankenstein, the monster himself is *painfully* aware of his own... unnaturalness. </span>

In ‘Frankenstein,’ it is the monster who limits Henry Frankenstein's contact with the normal world. The old Baron, Frankenstein's father, continually begs his son to "leave <del>this</del><ins>the</ins> madness," to come home, and marry the young Elizabeth. Finally the father, Elizabeth and Henry's best friend go to the lab and *force* him, for his own good, to leave his creation behind… to be free from his "obsession". To be normal. 

Later the monster fulfills Mary Shelley's initial prophecy by joining his creator on his wedding night, <del>carrying off Elizabeth,</del> and thereby preventing the consummation of the heterosexual marriage. The monster is then hunted by the townspeople.

In ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’ it is the odd, sissified Dr. Praetorius who comes to entice Henry Frankenstein from his bridal bed in the middle of the night.

Praetorius proclaims himself to be in love with evil and professes to detest goodness. 

No accident, then, that the monster, seeing the unnaturalness and folly of his own existence, takes the evil Praetorius with him when he pulls the lever to destroy himself and his bride, crying out to the young heterosexual couple of Henry and Elizabeth:

In later decades, the queerness of the Frankenstein story would reach its logical camp conclusion with ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show.’ A cult-classic rock-musical that Twentieth Century-Fox never gave a proper wide release in the United States. And it’s unlikely that, now that they own it, Disney will either. 

Since 1976, the film has been playing midnight shows in cities throughout the country. A truly subversive film on the subjects of sexuality, movies, sex roles, and the queer-as-monster, Rocky Horror features two innocent, presumed straight protagonists (Brad and Janet) who have car troubles not far from a dubious <del>mansion</del><ins>manor</ins>. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This foreboding <del>manor</del><ins>mansion</ins> is the residence of one Dr. Frank N Furter, the apotheosis of deviant sexuality, who introduces himself as “a Sweet Transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania." Frank N Furter is an androgynous alien from outer space. When the timid straight couple arrive, he is in the process of showing off his latest creation, a hunky blond named Rocky, who is straight off the slab and wears nothing but tight gold trunks. 

Pointing to Rocky, Frank N Furter sings a lusty "In Just Seven Days, I Can Make You a Man," then proceeds to introduce Brad and Janet to... well, his penis. Possible penis. We can’t know for certain. He is an alien, after all.

As both a catalog, and a spoof of old monster movies and science fiction films, ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ becomes almost dizzying in its references, but its most *expert* satire is of the age-old fear with which mainstream society encounters deviant sexuality. And is then followed through to the very end, when Frank N Furter is destroyed “for the good of society.” 

Nevertheless, he has one last chance in life to perform with the entire cast, an underwater ballet version of the film’s main message “Don’t dream it. Be it.” A song that becomes a message of hope for everyone who feels like they’re not quite who they’re supposed to be just yet.

Tim Curry's performance, especially in his rendition of "Sweet Transvestite," is the essence of what every parent in America feared would happen if our sexual standards were relaxed. It becomes the living horror of making deviant sexuality visible and tangible in the only kind of setting in which it could possibly work, an old dark house populated by every letter of the LGBTQ alphabet soup, as they sing rock and roll to seduce the innocent youth of America. 

Hollywood didn't know what to do with the *Rocky Horror Picture Show* then and probably wouldn't know what to do with it now. But despite its shabby treatment it has grossed *hundreds* of millions of dollars over the years and continues to play throughout the world to audiences made up of largely young people who attend screenings with bags of rice, stale toast, corsets, boas, and fishnets.

*Rocky Horror* was shining a spotlight on the *dimly* lit representation of queer monsters in the 1930s golden age of Hollywood. Giving them one last hurrah as a posthumous victory against the Hayes code, which collapsed *entirely* just a few years before its release. 

But back in the 1930s, filmmakers still had to be clever about coding the characters, specifically to make it past the censors.

General American audiences though could easily see through the coding. However, it wasn’t long before the easily read coding... was forced to become almost, if not completely illegible.
