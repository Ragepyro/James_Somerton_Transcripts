Over the last several years there have been 

demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood
movies. But something that many people don’t 

know is that the first movie to ever win Best
Picture at the Academy Awards, was also the 

first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss. 
William A. Wellman’s film Wings. Released in 1927. 
In "Wings," two World War I aviators compete 

for the affections of the same woman while
coming to terms with their growing feelings for 

one another. Despite being labeled a "friendship"
for the duration of the film (perhaps 

to circumvent censorship requirements),
it is evident that these two men 

are developing romantic feelings
for one another. Made clear by 

the climactic dramatic kiss. Wellman's silent film captures one of 

the earliest examples of LGBTQ cinema
by carefully toeing the censorship line; the 

film examines the expressed passions of two
men entangled in the conflict of WWI and the 

emotional torment of a forbidden connection. 
Wings went on to be a box office smash, and 

even at a time when the film industry was
quickly transitioning to sound, became the 

only truly silent film to win Best Picture. 
But WINGS is actually not where our story begins. 
The history of Hollywood has always 

had an asterisk beside it. Hidden in
the footnotes in tiny little print, are 

the queer actors, filmmakers, executives,
and tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from 

a backwater orange grove in California to the city
in which thousands of young dreamers make their 

way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a
long story. And like most classic American tales… 

it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

The love that dared not speak its name 

in America was surprisingly fluent when
speaking German throughout the silent era 

of film. While America was using its new
toy to glorify the Old West, recreating 

the fading dreams of its own mythology,
European cinema was shaping a more realistic 

look at the diversity of sex and gender. 
In much of Europe at the time, homosexuality was
often just another aspect of the 

panorama of human relationships. 
The Institute for Sexual Science, 

founded by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld,
became ground zero in the fight against 

Germany's anti-gay paragraph 175,
which criminalized homosexual actions between 

men, during the era of sexual enlightenment
that occurred in pre-war Berlin. It also produced 

the first film to discuss homosexuality openly,
and to contain many of the fundamental 

issues of the gay liberation movement. 
Directed by Richard Oswald, ‘Different from 

the Others,’ released in 1919 openly pleaded
tolerance, for what is termed the third sex. 

The program given out at screenings even read: 
“False beliefs and unjustified 

prejudices concerning a sector
of male and female sexual behavior known 

as homosexuality, or love of the same sex,
have been predominant up to the present and 

still influence a large part of our population. 
These homosexual men and women who are 

attracted to persons of their own sex,
are often regarded as wicked criminals and 

libertines. But scientific research has determined
that homosexuality is an inborn tendency for 

which the individual cannot be held responsible… 
There are homosexuals in every class, among 

the educated and among the uneducated,
and in the highest and lowest sectors 

of the population, in the great cities
and the small towns, among the strict 

moralists and among the most easygoing;
that love for one's own sex can be just as 

pure and noble as love for the opposite sex,
the only difference being the object of 

desire, not the nature of one's love.” 
The film, along with other works from the same era 

that dealt with topics such as abortion, incest,
sex education, and venereal disease, 

was propagandistic in its approach. 
In the early 1930s, Nazis were responsible for 

the destruction of most prints of the film.
Christopher Isherwood recalls that at the 

time, Nazis frequently disrupted screenings
of the film. In Vienna, one of them discharged a 

handgun into the crowd, injuring multiple people.
In his book “Christopher and his kind,” Isherwood 

provides a first-person description of the movie: 
“Three scenes remain in my memory. One is that 

a ball at which the dancers — all male — are
standing, fully clothed in what seems about 

to become a daisy chain. It is here that
the character played by Conrad Veidt meets the 

blackmailer who seduces him, and then ruins him. 
The next scene is a vision in which 

Veidt has a long procession of kings,
poets, scientists, philosophers, and other 

famous victims of homophobia, moving slowly,
and sadly with hands bowed. Dr. Hirshfield himself 

appears. I think the corpse of (Conrad) Veidt,
who has committed suicide at this 

point is laying in the background. Hirshfield delivers a speech 

that is to say a series of
titles pleading tolerance for the third sex.” 
And so it was that the very first gay man 

to ever be portrayed on film met his tragic
end by taking his own life. This would 

determine the future of LGBT characters
on film and television for many years to 

come. The suicide of Veidt and the idea of
blackmail predicted the fates of American 

screen characters who would suffer for
their sexuality in like manner when American 

cinema reached a similar point of inclusion
about 50 years later.

 

It would appear that the recognition
of the "third sex" in Europe was not associated 

with a particular concept of masculinity,
as was the case in the United States. 

The focus of the drama and intrigue was
not on the sexual aspects of the passions that 

were awakened in human relationships; rather,
the emotional qualities of the passions 

that were aroused in human relationships. 
In ‘Mikhail,’ produced in 1924, we see a 

gay love story in which a famous artist
falls in love with his young male model. The 

model, however, is an opportunist who saps his
benefactor’s artistic spirit, eventually spurning 

his affections for the more promising charms of a
wealthy young princess. In the end, the artist 

leaves all of his possessions to the youth,
and on his deathbed declares: "I can 

die in peace. I have known a great love” 
The film, which was adapted from the book of the 

same name, was released in America for a limited
time in 1926 under murky circumstances. 

What would come to be titled: ‘Chained:
The Story of The Third Sex’ ran for a 

short time at New York's Fifth Avenue
Playhouse. American censors objected to its 

first issued English title: ‘The Inverts.’ 
The modifications to the titles 

provide an excellent illustration
to the American thinking about 

homosexuality at that time. 
The subtitle “the story of the third sex" suggests 

that any narrative that deals with gay love,
regardless of how seriously it does so, is 

considered to be a story about homosexuality,
while stories that deal with heterosexual 

love are simply seen as stories.
This appears to be just as much of an issue 

for American filmmakers and producers today,
as they appear to be unable to conceive of the 

existence of queer characters in a movie, unless
the subject matter of the movie is being queer, as 

understood and depicted by mostly straight people. 
This discussion of gay men shouldn’t suggest 

that lesbians didn’t also get attention. In
the film ‘Pandora's Box,’ which was originally 

shown in Germany in 1929, there is a figure who
is most likely the first lesbian on screen to be 

portrayed overtly. The film presented the story
of the great unrequited love and passion between 

two women, the countess Geschwitz and the lady
she is enamored with, Lulu. Although the love 

that Geschwitz feels for Lulu is referred to as
‘sterile’ within the context of the movie, it is 

a driving force in the action, and it makes the
introduction of a sapphic passion onscreen 

an exciting and historical cinematic event. 
An event American audiences likely would 

never know of. British censors deleted the
character of Countess Geschwitz from the film 

before prints were sent to America. Though
original German prints did eventually 

make it across the pond in the 1960s. 
When it comes to American-made gay characters, one 

of the earliest direct references to homosexuality
was a parody. Which is… predictable, I suppose. 

The one-reel comedy short ‘The Soilers’,
starring Stan Laurel, was a parody of 

the successful western ‘The Spoilers’.
A drawn-out battle sequence between the film's 

lead, Laurel, and a corrupt sheriff takes up the
majority of the running time. But another, 

very gay, cowboy suddenly appears on the
scene in the middle of the brawl. As the two 

men continue to quarrel, he makes a show of
batting his eyes at both of them and primping 

a little bit before sashaying out of the room. 
Laurel wins the fight against the sheriff, 

but no one appears to care. As a result,
he is left sitting outside the tavern, looking 

disheartened. The gay cowboy pokes his head
out of a second-floor window and lavishly blows 

Laurel a kiss while mouthing the words ‘my hero.’
When Laurel rejects him, he 

drops a flower pot on his head. 
This is one of the first examples of the 

use of the ‘harmless sissy’ image to present
homosexuality in film. But in the context 

of rough-and-tough men in the soon-to-be
industry-dominant western genre, we were laying 

the foundations of the trope from the word ‘GO.’ 
There is a very overt connection between 

the effeminate and apparent homosexual
in this film. Even though the cowboy was 

not supposed to be impersonating a woman,
the primping and fussing characteristics that 

he displayed were unmistakably those of a woman.
At least as men at the time expected women to act. 

The comedy here was highlighting how out-of-place
this sissy boy was in this rough-and-tumble 

world of the men who won the west. 
The irony of course is that… there is significant 

historical evidence to suggest that the west was
in fact RIFE with gay men (many from Europe) and 

was largely settled by women in sex work. However
even though The Soilers is a mockery of queerness, 

among other things, the use of satire indicates
that Homosexuality, especially in the context of 

it existing in traditionally masculine spaces,
was on the mind of the public at large. Satire 

can’t function well if it’s not deriving content
from popular ideas. Even as the sissy cowboy 

isn’t flattering, though he is slaying, his
inclusion indicates that the public was, perhaps 

at the time, willing to accept us as harmless,
though strange and out of place. 
However, this was precisely the kind of event that 

the censors were keeping an eye out for. Public
Ordinances already enabled censoring organizations 

around the country to look at pictures in advance
of their public showing. Although all of those 

such entities had little actual authority,
their rules for morality in the movies clearly 

mentioned ‘sex perversion’ as a key don’t.
Even if queerness was the subject of ridicule. 
The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1915: 
“The exhibition of motion pictures is a business, 

pure and simple and is conducted for-profit,
like other spectacles not to be regarded 

or intended to be regarded as a part of
the presence of the nation or 

the organs of public opinion." 
This decision meant that movies were not protected 

by the first amendment guarantee of free speech.
Due to this ruling, harsh censorship legislation 

was eventually enacted in the states of New York,
Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia 

within a few years following this judgment.
The gold standard in the United States was in 

the New York statute that was passed in 1921. 
It stated that: “A film should be licensed by the state, 

unless such a film or a part thereof is of
such a character that its exhibition would 

tend to corrupt morals or incite crime.” 
Indecency, immorality, and obscenity were 

nowhere described or defined in the statute,
and thus there was considerable 

latitude for interpretations.
Essentially giving free reign 

to wealthy, white, right-wing,
Christian men to dictate what could and could not 

be in any given film released in these states. 
One of the first instances of lesbians 

kissing on screen was in a brief orgy
scene in Cecil B DeMille's ‘Manslaughter’ 

in 1922. The vision of two passionate women
locked in a forbidden embrace, was used 

by DeMille to condemn the excesses of
sex that he was portraying so 

graphically, and excessively. 
In return for his judgment of the 

‘crime’ he was consistently allowed
to paint a more explicit picture 

of evil, especially sexual sins,
then was ordinarily permitted by Hollywood 

censors. Showing things like sex, homosexuality,
interracial relationships, and other such things 

was fine, as long the participants were punished.
This was particularly true when the 

retribution transpired in a biblical city. 
Quoting Scripture on their title cards, 

DeMille films became moral lessons,
rather than exploitation. Or so was said. 

They also became box office extravaganzas.
Which… leads me to wonder just how far back the 

connection between these distinctly American sets
of pop-Christianity neo-puritanical values 

and American entertainment really goes. 
By 1922 there were censorship bills 

before the legislatures of 32 states,
and throughout the nation the distinct rank 

of moral indignation was wafting its way
toward an industry that at times seemed 

to embody wicked behavior of all sorts. 
The censors were horrified by ‘Salome,’ a 

1923 film with a reportedly all queer cast
made in tribute to Oscar Wilde. Forcing 

several sequences to be cut all together,
including one showing the gay 

relationship between two Syrian
soldiers. The handwritten report of the 

examining censor in New York concluded: 
"This picture is in no way religious in theme or 

interpretation. In my judgment, it is a story of
depravity and immorality made worse because of 

its biblical background. Absolutely sacrilegious.” 
American censors became even more potent in 

the late 1920s and early 30s. The inclusion of
audio into what were briefly dubbed as ‘talkies’ 

brought a new element of realism to the screen,
and public morality watch dogs began to bear 

down on the industry. But while censorship laws
were becoming more specific, their outlook on gay 

representation was kept vaguely broad. You didn’t
need two men or women kissing to get banned. Cross 

dressing, weakness or softness in male characters,
and even overly intellectual male characters 

were enough to draw the ire of censors. 
Will Hayes was appointed president of the Motion 

Picture Producers and Distributors of America — or
MPPDA — in the late 1920s. Hayes served as both 

an elder in the Presbyterian church and as a
former Postmaster General of the United States. 

That was the extent of his qualifications. The
organization was established primarily with the 

goals of fostering positive public relations for
the studios and shielding the business from 

the potential for more restrictions from the
outside world, which they mostly achieved in 

1930 when the motion picture production code,
which served as the basis for the industry's 

self-regulation and censorship, was actually
written. When the code was strengthened 

in 1934 under intense pressure from the
Catholic Church, even gently alluded 

gay characters began to disappear. 
he image of the film business as being harsh 

and manly, with no tolerance for foolishness,
was in continual conflict with the 

industry's reputation for being
effeminate. The censors used the ‘sissy’ 

archetype to target on-screen characters,
using it as a thinly-veiled scapegoat to 

put pressure on a relatively progressive
media industry which had been a safe haven 

for queer creators of all types up to then. 
But filmmakers knew how to skirt the 

censors in many cases. The fact that
most early movie ‘sissies’ were only gay if 

one chose to see them as being gay was simply
a reflection of the fact that the existence 

of queer people in society was acknowledged
only when society chose to do so. Instead 

of being overtly queer — characters like,
say, the femme cowboy from The Soilers, were 

viewed as symbols for ‘failed’ masculinity,
rather than actual homosexuals. And 

so they were allowed to stick around. 
Most ‘sissies’ during the reign of the 

code were not necessarily demeaned,
nor were they used in cruel or 

offensive ways. It was not the sissy,
but what he stood for that was offensive. Some 

actors created memorable galleries of gossipy
snoops and snippy shopkeepers, who were often 

a little on the innocent side. But not always. 
Gays were also associated with dangerous
revolutionaries hiding beneath 

the surface of normal society. 
The ghetto was one otherworld in which gay 

characters might frequently be seen on-screen
before and after the reign of the Motion Picture 

Production Code. This represented the reality of
the majority of Gay experiences at the time, 

which had been restricted to manifestations in
slums of one kind or another. The underground 

life as a shelter for gays is a common theme. 
In many instances, the gay ghetto has been 

linked to the criminal underground. This is due
to the fact that whenever there is an increase in 

illegal activity of any kind, even homosexuality,
organized crime moves in to take control of 

the situation and make a profit. (Though it
should be noted that organized crime functions 

VERY differently than Hollywood often depicts,
and in some cases, especially from the 40s and 

onward, can be beneficial to growing a community
and preventing gentrification and climbing rental 

rates.) Though as far as Hollywood played into
misconceptions of criminal behavior, homosexuals 

were widely considered to be a criminal group,
which differentiated them from other types of 

minority groups. Crime rates might be high in
some majority non-white areas, but just 

being a person of color was not, itself,
technically illegal. (Though representatives 

and law enforcement may act otherwise.) 
The film ‘Blood Money,’ released in 1933, 

showed a great deal of ambiguous sexual
tension in a wider underworld. In the movie, the 

existence of homosexuality is openly acknowledged
in the subculture that is a shelter on the 

fringes of acceptable society. In the film,
Sandra Shaw is featured in several sequences 

as a fun-loving blonde who likes men's clothes. 
At one point in the film, her boyfriend is 

preparing for a date along with his sister,
a nightclub owner, who warns 

him about the kind of women
he's running with, but he waves her fears aside.
“Oh this one is nothing but class. 

Wears a monocle and a man’s tuxedo.” “Then you’re safe.” 
Though he gets what she means, and protests,
later in the film Shaw turns up again in a tweed 

jacket, this time with another woman in tow. 
Movies like this were what led to further 

intensification of censorship in the mid 1930s.
In addition to strengthening the Code, Will Hays 

reacted to criticism by inserting morality clauses
into the contracts of actors, and compiled a 

"doom book" of 117 names of those deemed "unsafe"
because of their personal lives. Homosexuality 

was denied as fervently offscreen as it was on,
a literally unspeakable part of the culture. 
Hollywood has always been more restrained 

on the screen than in real life. In “blood
money” homosexuality is just another pocket 

of an underworld that exists outside the law. 
Sexual connotations often surrounded the 

attitude of powerful men toward hired boys,
or servile companions. Although the villainous 

character of Joel Cairo in “The Maltese Falcon,”
is identified by Sam Spade's secretary in the 

novel as homosexual, the film version, instead,
just turns him into a perfume wearing, 

cane kissing, ‘sissy’ with lace hankies. 
Elisha Cook jr. as Sidney Greenstreet's 

bodyguard Wilmer, however, is implicitly
homosexual. He is referred to as "sonny," 

"boy" and "kid," and Bogart derisively calls
him a "gunsel." Since about 1915, prisoners had 

used the German word gunsel to mean a bottom,
especially young inexperienced criminal bottoms. 
All of this was meant to connect the queer 

underworld with the underworld run, mostly,
by the Sicillian mafia who, due to 

movies like Scarface and Public Enemy,
were roundly feared across the country. 
This “fear the queer” mindset was brought 

to its logical conclusion in the horror
films of the 1930s, where gays appeared 

as predatory, twilight creatures with a
sense of style. The equation of horror 

with the sins of the flesh is easily
seen in monster movies of the period. 

Creatures like Frankenstein’s monster
and Count Dracula were almost always linked 

with the baser instincts of human beings. 
The essence of homosexuality as a predatory 

weakness permeates the depiction of gay characters
in horror films. In Dracula's Daughter, Countess 

Maria Zalesca has a special attraction to women,
a preference that was even highlighted 

in some of the original ads for the film.
Queer parallels in 1931’s ‘Frankenstein’ and 

its 1935 sequel, ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’
arose from a vision both films had 

of the monster as an impossible,
antisocial figure in the same way that gay people 

were "things" that should not have happened. 
In both films, the homosexuality of director 

James Whale may have been the spark of the vision.
Robert Aldrich, director of camp progenitor: 

‘Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,’ recalls that: 
”Jimmy Whale was the first guy who was 

blackballed because he refused to stay in
the closet. Mitchell Leisen and all those other 

guys played it straight, and they were onboard,
but Whale said, “**** it, I'm a great director 

and I don't have to put up with this bull**** 
And he was a great director, not 

just a company director. And he
was just unemployed after 

that. Never worked again.” 
It should be noted that many articles on James 

Whale do not reference his refusal to be closeted,
nor the Hayes Code in general, as a reason 

for the decline of his career. In spite of
available first-hand testimonials demonstrating 

that it wasn’t just a contributing factor — that
it was THE main reason. And Aldrich, who WAS a 

company director, if not an incredibly good one,
would have been in-the-know about what producers 

and studio heads were saying behind the scenes. 
According to Aldrich, an obviously lesbian 

director like Dorthy Arzner got away with her
lifestyle because she was officially closeted. 

A gay woman keeping her ‘lifestyle’ on the sly
was fine because “it made her one of 

the boys.” But a man who, like Whale,
openly admitted to his loving relationship with 

another man, in this case producer David Lewis,
did not stand a chance. Although James 

Whale worked again briefly in 1943,
he fell into obscurity soon after. In 1957 he was 

found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool. 
Frankenstein’s monster was the creation 

that would eventually destroy its creator
just as Whale’s own ‘aberration’ would 

eventually destroy his career. The monster
in ‘Frankenstein’ bears the brunt of society's 

reaction to his existence, and in the sequel,
the bride of Frankenstein, the monster himself 

is painfully aware of his own unnaturalness. 
In ‘Frankenstein,’ it is the monster who 

limits Henry Frankenstein's contact with
the normal world. The old Baron, Frankenstein's 

father, continually begs his son to "leave this
madness," to come home, and marry the 

young Elizabeth. Finally the father,
Elizabeth and Henry's best friend go to the lab 

and force him, for his own good, to leave his
creation behind… to be free from his "obsession". 

To be normal. Later the monster fulfills Mary
Shelley's initial prophecy by joining his creator 

on his wedding night, carrying off Elizabeth, and
thereby preventing the consummation 

of the heterosexual marriage. 
The monster is then hunted by the townspeople. 
In ‘The Bride of Frankenstein,’ it is the odd, 

sissified Dr. Praetorius who comes to entice Henry
Frankenstein from his bridal bed in the middle 

of the night. Praetorius too has created life,
and Henry's curiosity again overcomes his 

"good" instincts and proves his downfall.
Praetorius proclaims himself to be in love 

with evil and professes to detest goodness.
No accident, then, that the monster, seeing the 

unnaturalness and folly of his own existence,
takes the evil Praetorius with him when he pulls 

the lever to destroy himself and his bride,
crying out to the young heterosexual 

couple of Henry and Elizabeth: “Go! You live. Go. You stay.
We belong dead.” In later decades, the queerness 

of the Frankenstein story would
reach its logical camp conclusion with ‘The 

Rocky Horror Picture Show.’ A cult-classic
rock-musical that Twentieth Century-Fox 

never gave a proper wide release in the
United States. And it’s unlikely that, 

now that they own it, Disney will either. 
Since 1976, the film has been playing 

midnight shows in cities throughout
the country. A truly subversive film 

on the subjects of sexuality, movies,
sex roles, and the queer as monster, 

Rocky Horror features two innocent,
presumed straight protagonists (Brad and Janet) 

who have car troubles not far from a dubious
mansion. This foreboding manor is the residence of 

one Dr. Frank N Furter, the apotheosis of deviant
sexuality, who introduces himself as “a Sweet 

Transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania." Frank N Furter is an androgynous alien from outer 

space. When the timid straight couple arrive,
he is in the process of showing off his 

latest creation, a hunky blond named Rocky,
who is straight off the slab and wears nothing 

but tight gold trunks. Pointing to Rocky,
Frank N Furter sings a lusty "In Just Seven Days,
I Can Make You a Man," then proceeds to 

introduce Brad and Janet to, well, his penis. 
Possible penis. We can’t know for 

certain. He is an alien, after all. 
As both a catalog, and a spoof of old 

monster movies and science fiction films,
‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ becomes almost 

dizzying in its references, but its most
expert satire is of the age-old fear with which 

mainstream society encounters deviant sexuality. 
And is then followed through to the very end, 

when Frank N Furter is destroyed “for the
good of society.” Nevertheless he has one last 

chance in life to perform with the entire cast,
an underwater ballet version of the film’s 

main message “Don’t dream it. Be it.”
A song that becomes a message of hope 

for everyone who feels like they’re
not quite who they’re supposed to be just yet. 
Tim Curry's performance, especially in 

his rendition of "Sweet Transvestite,"
is the essence of what every parent in America 

feared would happen if our sexual standards were
relaxed. It becomes the living horror of making 

deviant sexuality visible and tangible in the only
kind of setting in which it could possibly work, 

an old dark house populated by every letter of
the LGBTQ alphabet soup, as they sing rock and 

roll to seduce the innocent youth of America. 
Hollywood didn't know what to do with 

the Rocky horror picture show then and
probably wouldn't know what to do with it 

now. But despite its shabby treatment it
has grossed hundreds of millions of 

dollars over the years and continues
to play throughout the world to audiences 

made up of largely young people who attend
screenings with bags of rice, stale 

toast, corsets, boas, and fishnets. 
Rocky Horror was shining a spotlight on the 

dimly lit representation of queer monsters
in the 1930s golden age of Hollywood. Giving 

them one last hurrah as a posthumous victory
against the Hayes code, which collapsed 

entirely just a few years before its release. 
But back in the 1930s, filmmakers still had 

to be clever about coding the characters,
specifically to make it past the censors.
General American audiences though 

could easily see through the coding. However, it wasn’t long 

before the easily read coding was forced to become almost, 

if not completely illegible. Thank you for watching this video, which is 

actually the first of eight videos I’ll be
releasing over the next few months exploring the
