I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey. Did you know that there were queer characters, and *not just* villains, in pre Hays Code Hollywood? (Meaning the long, long ago Hollywood, for the uninitiated.)

However, there was only a brief window of time between the end of the silent film era in 1929 and the institution of the morally restrictive Hays Code in 1934. For them to exist in any real form.

But as you'll know, if you've watched... *any* of my other videos, filmmakers manage to sneak in queerness despite the best efforts of the morally boring conservatives of the time. They just had to be sneaky about it.

They couldn't exactly show two men *kissing*, but they *inserted* their queer sensibilities into these productions. Sensibility that became *lovingly* known as Camp.

The gays had always been drawn to the film industry and the divas who fed it. Though you can't make a video talking about *Mommie Dearest* without highlighting some of her more... *unflattering* qualities, Joan Crawford is indicative of this. 

As one of the only actresses to survive the transition from silent films to what were referred to as "the talkies" (Get it? because moving pictures or movies and then... they had a sound, so they were talking pictures...? talkies?), Joan Crawford probably became the archetype of the Hollywood movie star. And the gays *loved* her for it.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Because she exemplified this strong femininity. She drew a massive fandom of gay men, which, to her credit, in an era when admitting gay people could even *exist*, would tank your career and even get you arrested, Joan openly supported the queer people who supported her.

Granted, when it comes to gays flocking to women who act as icons, some things never change. Joan, yes. Her rival, Bette Davis. Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, and, well... *all* the other old school Hollywood actresses you've actually heard of. Ask Cher. The gays can keep people around. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I suppose in this era of mid-century queer discrimination, civic mistrust and institutional persecution, we needed a way to propagate our culture. Unlike other communities, queer ones are non hereditary. We are not *usually* born into them. Because even if gay people *did* manage to raise a child, there was no guarantee that the child would be queer itself. 

So film was an easy way to propagate the values of our community to future generations. Legends within the community often suffered a tragically short lifespan even before the AIDS epidemic.

Having Joan Crawford epitomized poise and independence on the silver screen, in spite of not being a straight white man, offered a method of cultural continuity for us. Probably in a similar way that ancient cultures used figures of myth to propagate a cultural identity to new generations of illiterate villagers. 

But how did gay people of the 20th century choose the myths that they did?There were no shortage of films out there. Of those films. Why did we gravitate towards such a select few? What was the criteria for holding these up as relics to pass down to baby queers? 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

With lesbians there was a bit of a different process: Writers (who were usually men) were so clueless about writing women that they often accidentally wrote two friends being *so close* that it crossed into Sapphic territory, for which, again, enter Joan Crawford.

</james>
<from></from>
{% assign timecode = "03:43" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

But if that logic applied to straight men... why are any number of Westerns not held up by the gays? Because these cowboys often got *very* close and vulnerable with each other. Instead, we gravitated toward a very specific iteration of femininity in various specific films.

## 1: All About Eve

{% assign timecode = "04:45" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

*All About Eve* is a perfect place to start. Like I said, not the first queer icon movie, but one of the first you may hear referenced. A drag queen may refer to someone as an "Eve Harrington", and you may not know what that means. But what they're doing is accusing someone of putting on a pleasant face while being a backstabbing, social climbing upstart who's using more established figures to launch their own reputation. (Kind of like a gold digger. But instead of money, they seek fame and recognition.)

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And she chooses to latch on to Margo Channing, played by *the* Betty Davis. Margot is the queen of the New York theater scene, and even in her forties is still the highest regarded stage actress in the city. Eve Harrington is a poor girl who attends every performance she can of Margo's current show. Karen Richards, Margo's best friend, and wife of the show's playwright, spies Eve on one of these nights and invites her to meet Margot in her dressing room.

</james>
<from></from>
{% assign timecode = "05:35" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

Eve is introduced as an avid fan and captivates Margot with stories of her past of love, heartbreak, sorrow, and pure, unadulterated love for the theater. Margot brings Eve on as a kind of informal personal assistant, something Eve seems all too eager to do, waiting hand and foot on Margo's whims. 

And it's not hard for Eve to enchant almost everyone in Margo's inner circle. Karen, her husband Lloyd, and Margot's engaged-to-be-engaged boyfriend and director Bill Samson. As far as Broadway goes, this friend group is *royalty*. What a coincidence that the young and sweet and entirely unassuming Eve Harrington managed to elbow her way in. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The only one who thinks that the numbers aren't adding up is Margo's maid, Bertie Coonan, who's there to be a *good emotional support poor* and call Eve for being a fake bitch.

And soon Margot descends into a fit of assumed paranoia regarding the young Eve. She nearly breaks up with Bill. She alienates Lloyd, who specifically writes plays *for her*, and threatens her entire career. She's become convinced that Eve is trying to take her stardom away from her. And though it sounds paranoid, she's entirely correct.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "06:43" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And Eve's true motivations eventually become clear. When Eve does an interview, she says some particularly shady things directed at Margot. And so while Eve is playing her *Game of Thrones*, Karen begins to mend some of the tension between Margot and herself. Margot also finally accepts Bill's proposal. And the grown ups begin to get their shit together. 

Eve does keep her talons gripped in Karen's husband, Lloyd, though, who's one of the most highly regarded playwrights in New York City. She's after a starring role that was *written* for Margot, which she feels will be her ticket to stardom. All she needs to do is find a way to push Margot out of the role. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So as one does, Eve blackmails Karen to get her husband to steal the part away from Margot and give it to her. And when the film ends, Eve Harrington, the darling pariah... celebrates her Tony win for the part she stole from Margot. 

Now, exhausted in her condominium, she encounters a mild mannered young lady who absolutely idolizes her, who offers to wait on Eve hand and foot. And Eve, too caught up to notice that history is repeating itself right in front of her eyes, accepts her offer.

*All About Eve* is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It bags six Academy Awards out of a total of fourteen nominations, a record it still holds to this day, including Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, and Screenplay. It's also the only film in history to get four women nominated for acting roles, including one of Davis's most *infamous* Oscar snubs.

For additional trivia, this is also one of Marilyn Monroe's first films. A very small role, granted, but she makes an impact. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

While there *are* comedic elements to the film (especially Margot's biting shade), this is a very highly regarded, dramatic film. And yet we can see elements of this plot being played out in modern farces that are so over the top that they can be considered *beyond* camp.

Hell, you might see a plotline like this showing up on a season of *Real Housewives*. But that isn't to say that this model of story doesn't turn heads, in a good way, even to this day: 2010's *Black Swan* also, more or less, followed the story of a young performer latching onto the success of an established star to catapult her own career.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So it's not like the plot itself is tainted. But it does take a very steady hand to keep the format from descending into a catfight. And *All About Eve* is definitely not the only diva fight story out there. Especially if you want to swap an actress for goddess, there are any number of Greek plays and myths about goddesses destroying lives over petty disagreements. And are actresses not modern day goddesses worshiped at the altar of the tabloid rack? 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The gay appeal of *All About Eve* is likely a combination of a few things. Primarily the script, written by Joseph Mankiewicz, who wrote enough shade into the film to put Oscar Wilde to shame. Come to think of it, the film does share a number of very Wilden elements. On top of characters who spar with wit, there's a discourse on age and aging that leans toward an almost vilification of youth and those who venerate youth. 

But the film would be nothing without George Saunders, and Baxter, and of course, Betty Davis, to carry the film's demand for sharp minds. Davis herself had a very substantial gay following. A staunch ally in her private life, and at times even an outspoken one, referring to gays as her friends when confronting President Ronald Reagan about his administration's inaction during the AIDS crisis.

Davis herself was in no small part responsible for helping screen acting depart from its origins of theatrical acting. Whereas in the theater, an actor would *project* their acting to the back of the room, actions were *grand* and *bold*, and lines were delivered *clearly* and *methodically*. 

But Davis was more natural. And for this reason, whenever Davis was in a film, it was like she was acting in an entirely different movie from everyone else. She was one of the first actors to really dive into presenting a character with the kind of "naturalism" you couldn't really project on stage.

Which nothing exemplifies this more than acting opposite Joan Crawford in 1962's' *Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?* probably one of the most foundational films... of modern gay culture.

## 2: Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?

{% assign timecode = "10:51" %}
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Parodies of *this* have been done over and over again, to the point where you hear the name and you hear the premise...? And you likely think it's this hagsploitation comedic camp romp, that may compare to a telenovela.

Well, you'd be partially right, because it *did* kick off the Hagsploitation trend that carried Crawford through her late career in Hollywood. Hagsploitation was a particular subset of horror that was built on Hollywood's *disdain* for older women. Where women of a certain age are portrayed as horrifying monsters simply because of their birthday. But this genre in subversive fashion accidentally gave these women some of the best roles of their later careers.

</james>
<from></from>
{% assign timecode = "11:28" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

But as the progenitor of her Hagsploitation, *Whatever Happened To Baby Jane* is so much more than the genre it created. It tells the story of Baby Jane Hudson, played again by Betty Davis, and Blanche Hudson, played by the infamous Joan Crawford. (More on her later.) Formally famous sisters living in their twilight years. 

The film has two sequences which we can see as prologues. In the first, we see Baby Jane at the center of a stage performing a song and dance show for a riveted crowd. Her father, her manager and songwriter, prefers to redirect attention from Jane to himself, as indicated later on in the film, where we see that all of the songs he wrote for Jane were about *her daddy*. Off stage, Blanche longs for her moment in the spotlight.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "12:10" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In the second prologue, the women are *both* making their way through Hollywood. A producer remarks that Jane Hudson can't act to save her life, but they're stuck casting her. 

See, Blanche is their golden starlet, a talented actress who can sell tickets like none other. And she's got it in her contract that for every film she does, the studio must also cast Jane in another.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "12:31" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We then see a nighttime scene, where presumably one of the Hudson girls tries to murder the other by crushing her between a car and the driveway gate. The audience is led to believe that it was a resentful Jane who drove into Blanche and left her paraplegic and bed-ridden for the rest of her life. 

The film itself follows the progression of these sisters in their later life. Blanche's old films have gone on to television, and Jane is none too pleased with her particular lot in life, taking care of her sister, hand and foot, every time Blanche hits a bloodcurdling buzzer.

<james {% include timecode %}>

The plot revolves around Jane learning that Blanche is trying to sell their house, with no clear indication of what Jane will do when presumably left homeless. As a severely alcoholic six year old, she plans to take up her old act again and tour with her old songs for income of her own, and independence from Blanche. It goes... about as well as you would assume.

As Blanche gets closer and closer to selling the house, Jane begins to spiral deeper... depicted almost as a slasher serial killer tormenting a wheelchair-bound sister who can do *nothing* to escape her situation. Jane... is *terrifying*. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

About halfway through the film, Jane's portrayal begins to shift. Jane continuously expects people to know who she is and is a little put off when people don't recognize her.

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.baby_jane %}>

<james {% include timecode %}>

At first, this feeds into her portrayal as a monster, this arrogant, fame-obsessed petty woman who lauds her control over Blanche as the *only* thing that makes her feel powerful. We see Jane, and we think that she's out of her mind. That she's entirely convinced that it's possible to relive her girlhood. 

But as the film goes on... we get the feeling that she *is* legitimately out of her mind. And what we saw as arrogance is now depicted as a delusional mental state. She does not want to merely rekindle her youth. She seems entirely unaware that it even ended. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Having spent the entire film with her ghoulish white face and heart shaped beauty mark, we see it later on... smudged. We, the audience, finally see that this was not a directorial decision, but a component of Jane's character. Every morning she has been putting on this white face of makeup and drawing on a heart onto her cheek because she is locked in this state of existence and does not seem able to escape. This is, after all, the same makeup she would have worn under the bright lights of a stage. 

In fact, she begins to regress, acting younger and younger. But there's one problem that just won't let her be young.

Jane: (Dropping what she's doing) "Oh, shut up!!"

</clip>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "15:17" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Just like Jane, there's a flip for Blanche, too. Early on, we see Jane's accusations that Blanche is out to stop Jane from living her life, and we agree with Blanche's denial of that because... Jane seems to be the villain. And Blanche, by contrast, is sweet and patient with everyone she interacts with. 

But more and more, we see Blanche extending what control she has over Jane. The house, after all, is in her name. She controls the money. She controls Jane's drinking. And in a very nonchalant way, *does* like to remind Jane of that. And Blanche does, in her own way, begin to admit that maybe Jane's feelings of isolation at Blanche's insistence, *aren't*... completely unfounded. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

What seems like a woman afraid for her life and pleading with her captor can alternately be seen as a woman who's pulling out all the stops to placate someone she's been manipulating for years.

See, as Jane descends further and further into a childlike delusion, she begins to lose sight of the consequences of her actions. As she torments Blanche, Blanche begins to remind Jane of her dependance and her attempts to escape become bolder. Jane responds in kind, detaining her, ripping the buzzer from the wall, firing Blanche's maid, tying Blanche to her bed for days on end with no food, and then murdering the kind maid when she finds Blanche tied up.

When Jane is found out by the pianist she hired for her planned upcoming career resurgence, Jane is thrown into a full meltdown. For reasons unknown, she goes to Blanche and desperately pulls her into the car to go to the beach. Jane had reminisced about the beach, that she fondly remembers rehearsing there, where people would circle around to watch her dancing.

Jane has a wonderful day, running around barefoot, playing catch with... other children, and joyfully getting ice cream for her and her sister while forgetting to pay. All the while, dehydrated, malnourished, and immobile Blanche cooks in the sun. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Blanche does not have much time left and urges Jane to hear a final confession. Jane childishly holds her hands to her ears, refusing to hear what Blanche has to say. What she knows is true. And what she had to reject for the last 30 years to survive. 

That it was Blanche behind the wheel of the car that night. And that before the car hit Jane, she drunkenly stumbled out of the way. The accident left Blanche crippled and she crawled out from behind the wheel to make it seem like it was Jane who had tried to kill her.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "17:48" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

And then we see the film in a different light. This was not about a jealous sister who resented the other's fame and success to the point of committing torture. This was about a woman who had been gaslit *so severely* that her entire psyche had collapsed. Jane was robbed of her childhood by her father and robbed of her womanhood by her sister, all the while, everyone told her that *she* was the monster behind everything. And so she turned herself into that monster. 

Retroactively, we learn that Jane's feelings and paranoias were valid all along and that Blanche never really quit acting after all. Acting the part of the victim. Blanche had spent 30 years exploiting a fabricated guilt complex to make a loyal servant out of Jane. And as soon as she had a more pliable, willing servant, she was all too ready to completely discard her sister. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Jane, though a monster nevertheless, was a monster that Blanche had created, not entirely unlike us queer folk who are gaslit into believing we're the broken ones in a society too broken to accept us. Whose parents abandoned us, leaving us feeling unloved and unknown.

But on the California beach where Jane sits beside Blanche and remarks to her abuser:

<james {% include timecode %}>

And then the audience is left with this visceral discomfort for the next few hours.

Now, like with *All About Eve*, it's clear to see why it would appeal to femme-heavy queer circles. It's got all the kind of meaty, feminine things the drag queens love: outrageous personalities, women using duplicity as a weapon, old icons clinging on to past glory, pathos in excess -- which isn't a half bad definition of camp, actually. Pathos in excess. 

Finding gravitas in the mundane, making an aristocracy out of the destitute, isolating this house from the rest of the world. All the politics of culture, art, and society matter less than the ability to navigate the politics of this enclosure. Because the fact of the matter is that both of these women are suffering due to their father.

</compare>

{% assign timecode = "19:54" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

Despite having a relatively small role in the film itself, he left both girls with emotional scars that would heavily influence their downfall. Because while he did manage Jane's career in her youth, he also facilitated Blanche's career in Hollywood. And while he bought the house the girls live in, there is *some* question as to whether he bought it with the money he made off of Jane... or off of Blanche. Make no mistake, he *did* make the money off of his girls.

And something that is true to queer circles: it is so tempting to climb to the top of the heap at the bottom of the barrel, even if it means stepping on other people below you to do it. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But aside from plot and themes, the film's primary draw was being able to finally watch Joan Crawford and Bette Davis act against each other. Fans flocked to it like it was the boxing match of the century. The drama around this film hovered like a miasma. When in reality, the rivalry between Crawford and Davis was played up even at the time. Before *Baby Jane*, their "feud" amounted to basically fighting for the same roles for the past ten years. That was it. 

And when it comes to the making of drama, yes, there was a lot. In fact, as per the camp definition of making much ado about nothing, the behind the scenes antics rivaled what you'd watch in a movie. Ranging from all manner of petty things the women did to piss each other off. The studio, seeing the dailies come in, seemed to encourage this animosity among their actresses. Producers were worried that if Crawford and Davis buried the hatchet during filming, that their character's loathing of each other wouldn't be as palpable.

So, like in the film, two women were pitted against each other by men so that men could profit off of them. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But to me, the most interesting thing about the making of the film is that, yes, Joan Crawford *really did* pitch this idea to Warner Brothers and essentially single handedly pulled this project together. Maybe foolishly, she didn't go after a producer credit.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "21:44" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And honestly, if this was the kind of quality she could assemble, she could have been a *trailblazer* for women on the production end of Hollywood. Instead, Crawford was obsessed with being a movie star. Specifically, she wanted another Oscar, or at least a nomination. And she really thought that she could act the *straight* character opposite the woman losing her mind and get an Oscar nomination for being in a wheelchair for half the movie. She really thought that that was going to be enough. 

And no disrespect: she did have an Oscar by then. However, as a typified movie star, Joan Crawford really only ever played Joan Crawford in whatever movie she was in. That's what movie stars are for. They're cast, because their personal brand will fit in a given movie. 


</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And that's not to say that movie stars aren't as good or valuable as character actors. Would you rather be Julia Roberts or Tilda Swinton? It's not a contest. It's just a different game. 

That said, Davis *did* have a habit of elevating actors she was in the same room as. In instances like *All About Eve*, you can see the cast beginning to adopt more of Davis's signature style as the film goes on and become much more natural. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Perhaps to the benefit of *Whatever Happened to Baby Jane*, Joan Crawford wasn't a good enough actress to act through her natural narcissism. Crawford making sure that she was picture perfect for each shot, that the camera caught all her good angles. Her emphasis on beauty in spite of being *a shut in* who hadn't seen the sun for 20 years... All of that added an extra layer of fraudulence to the character. Joan's natural demea.nor bled through and added to Blanche's fraudulent duplicity. 

This is the value of a movie star. Without intending to, and perhaps without realizing it, Joan elevated an otherwise benign role. And it's because of all these nuances and subtleties that Hagsploitation became such a hit genre in the sixties. There was a clamor to cash in on the trope. *Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?*, with a budget of just under $1 million, grossed $10 million at the box office, which even by today's standards would be considered an indie success. But in the 1960s, this was a cash cow. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

However, as a progenitor, it employed a massive amount of talent in front of and behind the camera. Filmmakers who wanted to innovate to bring out the thematic elements of the story. It's often the curse of repetition that people will say, "I want to do that thing" without realizing what it was that made "that thing" so impactful. 

There's a reason *Halloween* spearheaded the slasher movie and was never superseded by the man with the knife copycats. Hagsploitation was constructed around old women being shady and even crazy. Though *Whatever Happened to Baby Jane* was a character study on the cognitive dissonance of long term gaslighting, the complex relationships of sisters, and constructing a narrative where truth and illusion are difficult to discern.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "24:31" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It all takes a very steady hand to pull that off without dipping into farce. Because you can get all the cheap thrills you need just by having women being naughty. There does need to be that element of pathos to really give something legs though, because it is in the pathos that we, the audience, can see ourselves reflected in. While there are few of us who are Blanche and/or Jane Hudsons, We can see the elements of their relationship and apply it to our own lives. And that's what happened to Baby Jane. 

Of course, it seems to be a pattern that we're inherently drawn to films which depict established icons serving up something new. Old dogs learning new tricks only adds to their legend.

The same year that what ever happened to Baby Jane premiered, the World of Theater was shook up by the premiere of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which went on to win Tonys for best play and in the acting categories.

The same year. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was first stage. The film Cleopatra also hit theaters. Another entry in Elizabeth Taylor's oeuvre, though, unfortunately, Cleopatra was a disaster. We remember it now as this kind of iconic symbol of Hollywood opulence. Taylor's personal wardrobe budget was nearly $200,000 in 1960. That's about $2 million today. Taylor herself was offered the part after a very lengthy casting process and only reluctantly agreed to do it.

So he's part of the club. The film took nearly ten years to finish and was initially pitched as a modest $2 million historical fiction.

Bringing Christina home as she has an interview scheduled. Joan, coyly, if not proudly, remarks that Christina was expelled after telling Christina not to talk about the expulsion. I can't think of a single parent who would gloat about their child's expulsion. But to Joan, it's almost like a victory. A failure for a rival is a victory for her. Christina points out to the reporter that she was not, in fact expelled, to which Joan throws a fit over being accused of lying.

And now we're getting into the territory of Christina's accounts that can be backed up by fact. Fact number one is that, yes, Joan really did replace Christina on a soap opera that Christina was cast in. Joan in her sixties takes the role of a 28 year old woman while Christina is recovering from a benign ovarian tumor. Number two is another iconic scene.

Joan Crawford was on the board of directors for PepsiCo via her husband. The company was a nothing upstart to compete with the behemoth that was Coca Cola.

Ironically, this is one of dunaway's more understated lines in the entire film. This meeting, in reality, was much more cordial than Dunaway delivered. Why did it need to get turned up to an 11 year old? Why not? That's why rounding off the film is the reading of Joan Crawford's will with Christina and Christopher. When it comes to what Joan left them.

Joan writes that they will receive nothing for reasons which are well known to them, which was the literal reading of the will that happened. That's the last thing Christopher and Christina ever heard from their mother. And when asked, apparently neither of them know what those reasons were. There are some suggestions that Joan wrote them out of the will because she heard Christina was already writing Mommie Dearest while Joan was alive.

But that doesn't explain why she nixed Christopher. The film doesn't even mention Joan's younger two children, who she adopted just about the same time that Christina went off to boarding school. Funny timing that Now, as with all great camp movies, half of the fun is the gossip and the making of Mommie Dearest is no exception. As mentioned, Mommie Dearest was a celebrity exposé.

Christina's account is a pained, tormented struggle between loving her mother and recalling good memories of Joan, but also living through some very traumatic abuse and behavior. Though the way Hollywood figures talk about it, especially those who are close to Joan, even Bette Davis herself. Christina makes Joan out to be a demon that she wasn't.

Hollywood is said to be a small town and the vitriol directed at Christina may simply be them protecting one of their own. Christina does make a point of specifically blaming Hollywood for crafting Joan's narcissism before the fall of the studio system. The studios themselves would mold their stars into fitting specific personality ideals to put on airs not only for cameras, but for fans in private.

It was rare that you'd get a star like Davis or Katharine Hepburn, who didn't bother with the facade. This is apparent in a documentary called Bright Lights, starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. May they rest in peace. Reynolds, while being interviewed, still had her signature Debbie Reynolds charm. However, the documentary crew kept the cameras rolling when Carey took her aside from around the corner.

Debbie's voice is much weaker, more vulnerable, even though she was a woman in her eighties. Debbie Reynolds was the mask she had to wear for the public. Luckily, she did have a supportive family with whom she didn't have to wear it. Christina's take seems to be that Jones simply wasn't able to take that mask off at all and resorted to drastic behavior when the porcelain started to crack.

But with all hatred toward the story and toward Christina, it does boggle my mind that Hollywood was so horny to get this movie made as soon as the book came out. You couldn't find anyone who had anything good to say about it. Faye Dunaway herself agreed to play the role as long as it was more respectful to Joan's memory than the book.

Though Christina's book was obviously an exploitation book, the first one of its kind. My task was to portray a woman, a full woman, who she was in all her facets, not just one. I tried to illuminate who this woman was, but it was more than just about being angry. It was about trying to examine and explore the forces that undermined her.

I don't think Faye and I watched the same movie. Christina actually did not feel that Dunaway's performance accurately depicted her mother, specifically claiming that Dunaway's depiction of Joan was far more monstrous than she ever experienced.

Is that anywhere near the way Joan Crawford actually acted? Only the makeup.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Faye Dunaway specifically went out of her way to manipulate the script, the director and producers to humanize Joan, all the while lambasting the book tabloid drivel only for the author of that drivel to decry the performance for depicting a monster. It also didn't help that Dunaway was already kind of a diva once again. Ironically, Joan Crawford was quoted saying.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "56:27" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Of all the actresses to me. Only Faye Dunaway has the talent and the class and the courage it takes to make a real star. Dunaway later blamed Mommie Dearest for hurting her career, and given that she was a bit of a hot ticket actress before the eighties, she was forced into roles in smaller films for the rest of her life.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "56:47" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And on one hand, you may say it's because of her performance, but plenty of actors have had bad roles, maybe nothing so monumental as this, but Faye was a bit of a hassle, you see. On top of being a prima donna in general, she allegedly terrorized the set of Mommie Dearest. For starters, she refused to drop out of character during production.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "57:06" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So on top of delivering that on camera, the crew and cast had to live with that for weeks, wrote Tanya Alda, who played Joan's assistant in the film, wrote a behind the scenes memoir about the filming experience. She wrote People despised Faye because she was rude to people. Everyone was on pins and needles when she worked and relaxed when she didn't.

{% assign timecode = "57:29" %}

To name a few things, Faye allegedly manipulated the director to rob actors of their screen. Time to pull it to herself. She also insisted that people on set needed to turn away from her while she was performing because she didn't want an audience regarding her method acting and will avoid a discussion about what method acting really is and how a lot of actors misuse the term.

Dunaway had the usual nonsense to say, but with an extra twist. If your mind is on a woman who is dead and you're trying to find out who she was and do right by her, you do feel a presence. I felt it at home at night. Sometimes it wasn't pleasant. I felt Joan was not at rest. So I think what happened is that Faye was so engaged with the memory of Joan that she may have spurred a vindictive streak against Christina.

</james>
<from></from>

{% assign timecode = "58:20" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

And so she kind of took out all that bottled up rage on the effigy of Christina. Which is why you got all this aggression, I think. While there was an initial wave of critics who hailed her performance, it didn't take long for the public perception to swing the other way. Going down as one of the best bad performances of all time, a serious actress like Faye Dunaway did not cotton to that idea.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "58:44" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

She blamed the director for not railing her back. She blamed the editors and the producers for taking her depiction of a window into a tormented soul and making it camp. She blamed Christina and her husband. She blamed Christina's book. And worst of all, she blamed her audience for not taking away her intended interpretation. Though she has come around to the unforeseen fandom of the film but still doesn't quite get what they see in it.

Because make no mistake, there is a fandom around this moving picture. Little did Dunaway know she had opened the floodgates to a whole fandom that had only until then existed in burlesque shows a fandom that, upon the movie's release, would hang Christina Crawford in effigy. Mommie Dearest legitimized a whole group of audiences and creators who were going to do what Dunaway did, but do it on purpose, with or without the ghost of Joan Crawford.
