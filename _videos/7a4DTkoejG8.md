Hello everyone, and welcome to "Gays Behaving Badly", a new feature on the channel that we're gonna try out for a bit, and if you like it let us know in the comments. My name is James.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I'm Nick.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And Gays Behaving Badly is basically a podcast with cameras. We will be discussing things that the... queer community doesn't like to talk about or doesn't like to acknowledge very much.

Uh this first episode we're going to be talking about the... kind of queer Erasure of all of asexual and asexuality and aromanticism from the LGBTQ+-ness.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, the ace spectrum. Um... that's kind of one of the um...

It's in a lot of ways considered one of the ugly stepchildren of the queer community and um... When I was working in queer circles I... there was that kind of discussion...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

You worked for a pride organization once.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

There was that discussion, very innocently had, about like.... like, they wanted to make sure that only queer groups got like a... There was kind of a... a kiosk sort of station, where were different groups and organizations would set up kiosks that people could visit. And there was a-- and they wanted to make sure that only queer people could *have* these spots, because what would happen is people would just kind of get a spot. Even though they had nothing really to do with queerness.

Um, so like there was kind of an asexual group and there was a discussion like... is that specifically a queer group?

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've seen that a lot because... there's a "debate" among... especially, I've seen it among gay men that asexual people shouldn't be included so much, because you know asexual people are not persecuted-- actively persecuted for their sexuality. 

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I-- I-- I-- I see that sort of... angle, however my justification--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I'm not saying I agree with that [Inaudible], by the way.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

oh yeah yeah, that's the information, but my justification for why--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We should just call this "Disclaimer: the Podcast".

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

\[Laughter]

My-- My organization-- My sort of qualification for this (and we've talked about this and you agree) is, um... that the queer community is a community of people established by a means of exclusion. Uh, we weren't collected in the hegemony, so we kind of banded together.

And while there might be no specific persecution for asexual people in the way that *gay* people have faced, there is a kind of very quiet persecution for asexuals. It seem as being-- For instance, I think uh asexuality in the American Psychological Journal is still qualified as a mental-- As a psychological disease, a mental health disease.

Correct me if I'm wrong. But like... when you are asexual you do see a myriad of ways that, uh, there's basically a psychological warfare against you. *Every* piece of media is focused around a romance or sexual attraction. It's seen as a for-granted thing for almost every piece of media, almost everyone there's that sexual expectation...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And even when there's not, it's... Viewers will *assume* that (especially if there's a male and female character), if there isn't a romance between them viewers will assume by the end of the movie or the TV show that there *will* be.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Right, absolutely, and-- and outside of media in like sort of... polite discussion... There's a way that people kind of, you know, when you're outside of polite discussion, and you're kind of being more personal with someone, there's a comfort with sex that is taken for granted. Like, you know, if you're having, you know, a rough time, your close friend might say, "just go out and shag someone".

And that's kind of seen as just like a universal. So it's a lot of very subtle ways that the hegemony reminds you that you're not really welcome. Or that you should be different. Or that you're there's something wrong with you. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

<mark>And while there isn't really any conversion therapy directed to the asexual people...</mark> and while you think that there wouldn't be because society is kind of geared towards this neopuritan attitude of avoiding sex and avoiding uh sexual attraction at least in public discourse and especially like in public areas... there is that expectation that it's something that *is* going to happen behind closed doors.

</nick>
<comment id="conversion_therapy">

Those in the ace community do very much get targeted by conversion therapy. [TODO link to The Ace Couple]

</comment>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. Again, just kind of going back to the idea of that in media... if there's not the romantic interest, if there's not the sexual interest, that there will be... the assumption, because the... overt sexuality is the default.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Oh yeah yeah yeah.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Um, and like you said, that there's not like conversion therapy for-- for ace people, but I think there's a huge amount of social pressure. So there's not like... organized--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And you want to sort of have evidence of what you're saying about there being like an expectation of sexuality. Take two queer-coded characters, or a queer-coded character, and straight people will automatically assume that they are straight. Like look at Yuri from-- Victor from Yuri on Ice. There is a huge straight component of the audience for that show that assumes that Victor is straight and hypersexual--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Which is hilarious.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Which is hilarious. Because he's the bottom um... so like there's that expectation that it's going to be there, even if, in the media, it's not depicted that way, very clearly. But like and asexuality is beginning to be discussed in a larger, broader context nowadays. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I feel like with-- sorry for interrupting, I feel like we should pause and just kind of explain to anyone who *doesn't* know what asexuality is.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's what we're getting. That's what we're getting. There's a perception of what it is, uh-- There's a perception of it, versus what it is. And this discussion... The ways that asexuality is beginning to manifest, in sort of representation in media and a discussion in public. Even when it's done well, it's usually-- Or when it's done earnestly, it's usually only ever sort of half-baked. It's a much larger spectrum. It's a larger fish pond than what people see. So there's-- 

Asexuality is defined as a aversion to sex, lack of sexual drive, lack of sexual attraction, um... And that's kind of where the definition is formally very very vaguely. It's very unspecific. 
{% assign timecode = "6:32" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Because there is, you know... Obviously within sexuality, there is a spectrum of sexuality, but there is just as big a spectrum within asexuality. Of where you kind of land...

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

But the public perception of asexuality is Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I don't even think it's Sheldon, because Sheldon does have sex and does get married...

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I know but like... once again like... That's true, actually. Um, because well, I see that it is asexual, it's like a lot of people in the audience might think "oh Sheldon is *no longer* asexual". 

When I was kind of experimenting around with kind of identifying as asexual in university, I was kind of close with this one girl who lacked a lot of social skills... and when she did get a boyfriend she was like, "Guess what: I'm no longer asexual!"

And I think that's how a lot of people feel that it *does* work, it's like-- it's like the bisexual thing: when you get married to a man or a woman, it's like no longer straight, or no longer gay.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, as soon as you-- you know, if you're a man and you start dating-- this is-- this is oddly a belief within the queer community especially, *especially* among gay men, is that if a man is bisexual and starts dating a woman he's actually not bisexual. He was, you know, just looking for some--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And if you get married, you're Straight For Life. --to a woman-- to a woman. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, your bisexuality just disappears suddenly--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And if you get married to a-- And if you shack up with a guy or get married to a guy, it's like, "well, it's just a transitional period."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"Oh, you're gay now." well yeah that's- that was a big thing for bisexuality, it was bi now gay later. Um, because-- 

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And like I understand why that existed at the time because we came from a very... 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Binary system.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Not just a binary system but a very persecutional system where being bisexual meant that you could still latch
onto some of that straight privilege. Um, and make it easier-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

You didn't *have* to get a boyfriend.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, and sort of make an easier transition into this kind of sexuality. Um, I've actually heard the inverse too, that people will kind of, um, they'll be straight and then they'll "snap" to dating a guy and be like, "oh I guess I'm gay now." And then they'll realize, "wait a second, I still like girls." 

So um, I think that's where a lot of the perception that bi people are sneaky, um, very wrongly came from because we have this idea - we were talking about this the other day - that there isn't really room for experimentation in society. You're not really allowed to experiment or play around or sort of investigate different things. It's like, when you are- when you begin to exhibit signs of being gay, "oh, you're just gay." It's like there's no room for fluidity. Um, but-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Back to the asexuals.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That was- I was flipping that around! I was saying like asexuality is actually a lot more fluid than people think it is. Because Sheldon *can* get married and he-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well I don't think Sheldon was ever- ever conceived-

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I'm using that as an example. I'm using that as an example.
{% assign timecode = "9:14" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, that's what people think of asexual as, the people who just have no, uh sexual drive, who have no interest in sex, who have no interest in romance, who have no interest in any kind of pairing whatsoever.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's also not the- Well yeah that is the-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

That's the *assumption* from the masses.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yes, yes, sorry. [laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

That's the assumption, whereas in reality, like I said there is a spectrum of asexuality that goes from that to any number of other options.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And something that we're beginning to realize is that there is a separation between asexuality and
aromantic. Which I feel a little bit concerned, the thing I'm starting, I'm starting to see, not that I'm concerned, I'm starting to see a trend for people to describe asexuality as aroace. I'm like, "that's not necessarily the case."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah that's kind of the um- the LGBTQ kind of- yeah, "we'll just call
you LGBTQ," it's like, "Actually, I'm a lesbian." It's like, "well you're LGBTQ."

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Some people are aroace and they have neither romantic nor sexual attraction to
anyone.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But some people can fall in love very easily with no sexual attraction
and some people can be *very* horny with no romantic attraction.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Talk to any asexual person and they will tell you that they are incredibly kinky and horny. Since- wait no.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Not *any* asexual person! [laughter] I mean there's plenty of asexual people who have no interest in any sex.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's true, there is- within the community there is kind of a marked, um, acknowledgment, a very quiet
acknowledgment that some of the kinkiest people you ever meet are identifying as asexual. Uh, cause they keep their sex up here. [points to their own head.] Like, they just don't let it get out of their head. It's-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's- it's all internal and because it never has to exist in real life, they never have to face the ickiness.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I'm pretty sure that a very strong component of fanfiction, like slash fiction, erotic fan fiction, um, libraries are contributed to by asexual people. [laughter]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Um, so we're gonna play a game and assume that this video gets monetized, and for anyone watching it not on YouTube... Plus? YouTube Premium? YouTube- that- paid-

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Fancy YouTube. [laughs]
{% assign timecode = "11:12" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Fancy paid YouTube. Um, we're gonna take a quick break and we'll be right back and for anyone who doesn't have that... 
{% assign timecode = "11:22" %}

</james>
</compare>

## Segment 2

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We're back! All right, so this is I guess... segment two. Um, so kinky! You were talking about kinky.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yes, I was talking about kinky. Um and this is kind of the appearance versus reality of asexuality. The reality of asexual sexuality is that it is a very broad area and this has troubles translating into the dating world. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I can imagine.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah. Because for me online on Grindr, the things that I will say to people, first of all hopefully will never get leaked into the world, uh... second of all, I... before I meet a guy and this was a historic thing I had to kind of give a disclaimer, like, "hey, heads up I know we've been talking about certain things but I need to tell you that the more you get to know me in person, I'm not as horny as I seem to be." And that's just because I have a very active imagination and I really--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, you're a writer.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, I enjoy the idea of sex. Um, but like there are some branches of asexuality which much prefer to do sex online, or sex on the phone, uh, sex in a hypothetical context. Some prefer-- Some do not like penetration and like uh...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And I mean that's becoming a whole thing within the gay community now, is, you know there's tops and bottoms and verse blah blah, but now there's sides, which are people who do enjoy sex but not penetrative sex.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

yeah, and I, I really like that that... I always thought that butt sex was a little bit overrated. And just just-- but a huge portion is the idea that so many gay people (and you might qualify as this) don't think that it counts as sex unless it's-- unless it's penetrative.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've actually really changed my mind about that, even-- even as of six months ago I was very in the backward thinking of like, "sex needs to be penetrative, if it's not then it doesn't count." And you know I've really come around to that because.. you know, sex I think to me now encompasses such a wide range from the most intense, sweaty, nasty thing that you know Treasure Island Media produces, to, you know, phone sex. And/or making out in the back of a car, and you know it all depends, it's a personal person.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Greater separation between like sex-- a sex act, I qualify anything as a "sex act" as a sexual encounter. Anything with the intention of having that kind of sexual passion associated with it. 

Um... And so like there there is a lot of um... explaining that I have to do... and usually I get ghosted... after that because it's like... 'cause I can see where they're coming-- where guys are coming from in that case. Because it's like, "oh, you're suddenly getting cold feet and you need an out." Um, and that's kind of how I get that kind of "out" feeling sometimes...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
Yeah, like people would could look at that as, you know, that you're really just looking that you're-- oh what's the term?

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>
  
Screening?

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

No, maybe, something like that but it's- there's a specific term for it for people who are just.. they just want to, you know, "cyber" and that's it. They'll lead you on for weeks and weeks and weeks.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

(I have done that...) Um, because like sometimes I...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I need like a "bonk", I could go like, [mimes hitting Nick with a newspaper] bad!

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[laughs] Well, listen what that is, I'm never dishonest about it. I sort of am upfront and I say, like, "I'm not really interested in meeting up," um... but I love doing cyber, I love talking to people, and regardless of that there is still an ongoing expectation that, "oh we're gonna meet up eventually, he's just saying he's not into meeting people so he can bypass all of the undesirable-- whoops- I'll bypass all the undesirable gays!" Um, and when I was kind of coming of age on gay dating--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
And that isn't-- that's the first I've ever heard about that just today, the "screening process". That there are people that will put on the that kind of asexual-esque gaze to kind of screen out the ones they're really not interested in.
{% assign timecode = "15:33" %}

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

'Cause like, you know, when I was kind of coming of age on Grindr there was a big thing to sort of say, "not into meeting up," "not into hooking up." Um, and I *like* that because sometimes I *wasn't.* But then sometimes I was, and I would find the right personal and realize, "Oh. People are doing this maliciously." They are doing this to screen out people who are not physically attractive, they're not-- they're not physically attracted to. Um... And so when you did get that kind of good chemistry, regardless of whether you wanted to meet or not, the other person would have that expectation because it's like, "oh, I passed the screening process."
{% assign timecode = "0:00" %}

So, when you would kind of-- when it would become a- became *apparent* that you weren't really as into hookup culture as they wanted to be, or thought you would be, they kind of just abandoned you. Um, And when you *were* up front and you said like, "I'm not really into meeting up, I just want to talk", I think they got the vibes that I was just consistently going to be putting them off, or that they would eventually pass the test one day, and you know, would get to do the physical stuff. 

But it took me a long time to sort of be comfortable with like being not as... intimately sexual with people. And I kind of, for the sake of being polite, I forced myself into a lot of kind of hookups that I wasn't really that interested in, or that I knew I wasn't going to have a fun time from the beginning. Not that there was any consent problems, it's just that I wasn't really into it, and I was kind of like-- it was kind of like, you know, laying there like a fish. [laughs]
{% assign timecode = "17:00" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And yeah, it seems like -- from the asexual people that I've talked to -- that it's- it's like a second coming out process. That. you know, you kind of spend your teenage years figuring out if you're gay or bi--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Because you *think* you *have* to be hypersexual, because that's the kind of depiction--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
Especially with the gay community. Like, we have kind of-- the culture, the gay culture, has really, up until *very* recently when it was kind of-- the gay culture has become two dads and a kid in the suburbs, that it was circuit parties, and, you know, ecstasy, and stuff like that. That gay culture was the height and the- the- the absolute peak of sexuality. And so, how can you be gay and asexual?

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

On that regard, even if you are-- Even if you are that kind of monogamous kind of person, like when-- watch any gay drama, like Elite. (Is it Elites, or Elite?)

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Uh that's not just gay, that's gay and straight. *Very* hypersexual.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

I know, I know, but like, when you were-- when you did get a permanent, you know, boyfriend, you would kind of... when the door is closed, *oof!* That's when the heat would hit, like...
{% assign timecode = "17:58" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. It's like, "okay now we need to-- you know, the sweat needs to start pouring off of us. It needs to be a porno film. And if it's anything less then we're doing it wrong."

Especially when- when you're gay, the only-- when you're specifically attracted-- a man attracted to men, or you know um... then it's very much... that *is* your early exposure to gayness. There's not a whole lot of, you know like, kids movies with a child-- There's no *Little Rascals* for gay people, where there's a childhood romance.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

It's like, you watch the kind of raunchy gay movies a *little* bit earlier, because you're much more curious than your peers, so that's kind of, you know, you're hypersexual. Like you and *Queer as Folk*! 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, like I, uh-- *Queer as Folk* was really my first, um... not my *first* exposure to gay people, but it was certainly the most, um...

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

So like you know-- you young little gayby comes of age, and like it's their exposure to, "oh this is how I be gay as an adult".

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, that "this is what gayness as is as an adult. This is what gayness is in high school, even."

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But the- the- the other side of that, is this kind of-- And that you have that, and that conflicts with the perception of asexuality. Which is the "doesn't have sex" and-- in media, this is very often the case, and a lot of asexual people are kind of upset by this, asexuality is represented by robots, aliens, and autistic people. And as it happens a lot--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And rarely confirmed in any of those cases.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah. A lot of-- Or completely unconfirmed and just not acknowledged, like with Elsa. In a lot of those cases like, asexual people don't really like that, because we can be incredibly vibrant, colorful, zany people uh--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well, yeah, I don't know any asexual people who are like Sheldon or Data. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

And even then, like... I think that's... 

Data was snarky, though.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've never seen Star Trek, I'm just going by YouTube clips.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

When I was younger, my mom said that I was a carbon copy of Data. I always loved the character, because my mom had Star Trek on a lot when I was younger. And like, I think that's a discredit to autistic people too. I identify as somewhere on the spectrum. I don't know what, but-- because like autistic people can be incredibly hypersexual, and that's perfectly fine too! And so like kind of pigeonholing these identities together because you know this privileged-- writer of privilege, this creator of privilege, has this one experience with this one person, thinks "oh, this one this must be what it's like for everyone".

So, those are two very conflicting public perceptions of what these identities ought to be. And when you put them together it's--- what do you get? Like people just don't believe you. You have no idea how many times I've gotten... Like I said "I'm asexual" and then kind of get the retort, "Oh, you just haven't met the right person." 

</nick>
</compare>

Oh I-- I absolutely believe that. Um, that's-- I've seen that in so many different conversations and podcasts and whatnot. People kind of talking about, you know, "I'll tell someone I'm asexual" and it's just, "oh, you just haven't met the right guy yet." Um, and it's the same with-- It's the same kind of thing with women who say like, "I never want to get married", and it's, "you just haven't met the right guy yet", or "I never want to have a kid" and it's--

</james>

<nick>

Yeah, it's just like, "You'll change your mind."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"You'll change your mind." Yeah, "once it happens you'll change your mind" kind of thing. Um, and so that seems to be a-- that seems to be a societal thing, that if you're anywhere outside of the societal norm, which is very restrictive-- like I said, even a woman who doesn't want to get married is outside the societal norm. Society kind of says to you like, "just wait, you'll get there."

That's something that I was really trying to push in the video about Black Swan. Kind of the concept of "okay, you're not here to procreate, what are you here for?"

I read a script with no glasses and I am *blind* without these glasses.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[Laughing] That's true! That's true! That's true! 

Um... and so it's really just hard to get across the... the weird little nuances of "yes, I want to meet people, I'd like to have these experiences, but like I want to have them my way. I want to have them in a way that I'm -I'm going to enjoy." And it's like, I'm also not opposed to negotiation.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. But then when you kind of say--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

And this is the thing about asexuality: some people-- some asexuals are like, "I do not like sex. I don't want to have it. It does not feel good. I hate it." And other people are like, "I could take it or leave it."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, and that's- that's what I was going to say is that, when you do kind of put it on the table that like, "I don't really like sex very much, but with the right person... you know, I will lower my boundaries and I'll do it," which kind of poses the question, how- "are you asexual enough?" Which we will get to after the break!

Okay, so after a break, and a camera and microphone meltdown... we're back! Uh, so yeah, posing the question, how asexual is enough?

</james>

<compare>
<nick>

[laughs] Growing pains! Um, "asexual enough," and that is aquestion for the ages in the Ace Community. Uh, 'cause it is... large in the sense of there are a lot of people in it and not so much large in the sense that ev--
 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I think there's more people who would identify with asexual if they realized that
it wasn't, you know, Sheldon and Data.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, that it was an option. The discussion of what is ace enough comes up from a matter of, some ace people do enjoy some kind of sex, in different circumstances. Um, but the question arises, um you know, what qualifies as asexual. Because you get the purists who say "ace or aromantic means that you have no sexual desire or that you have no romantic connections." Uh, but some people have these things but in very specific circumstances. You mentioned people who like to only do it for cyber. Um, there are--  

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. People who only are into cyber sex, people who only like to have sex with people they are in love with, people who don't like- who only like to have sex with people they have no romantic connection with.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Uh, there's some debate about like, does a side qualify? Like, you know you have tops, bottoms and sides, is that asexual? Because you know, they don't enjoy penetration. Um, and I kind of fit into that kind of camp, like-- 
</nick>

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And like that's-- I don't think most sides within the gay community would say that they're asexual. Because they-- 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Probably not, no. There are plenty of reasons to not enjoy butt sex aside from just, "I don't like having sexual contact." Um, so
like-- and the thing about- 
</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's painful, it's messy.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

It takes a lot of work, um, health complications. 


</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Just kills your legs. But yeah, asexual enough--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

The- the question is that I had this struggle with my own kind of identity, because I identified as asexual, because, um you know, I- I had *some* sexual drive, I had sexual urges, but like when push came to shove like I didn't really like doing it that much yeah

25:23
um but I loved think I love the build up to that I love the lead up to that I loved
thinking about it I love putting myself in situations everything until you got
to his door uh yeah and then I would just feel immense shame after we were done
I didn't really get that kind of elation afterwards now is that shame of you
know shame of having had sex or is that shame of not having enjoyed it the shame
of not having enjoyed it okay um so it's not like a Puritan thing yeah it didn't
build it didn't lead up to my expectations it wasn't what no is it that it
didn't meet your ad your expectations or did you just flat out not enjoy the
deep throat thing there wasn't the bells the whistles the Rockets the fireworks
I didn't get that for anyone not in the know
um there's a scene in the movie
Deep Throat which is a 1972 1972. uh a straight adult movie in which some
somebody has an orgasm and that's where the you know the bells and the whistles
and the fireworks and everything that's where that saying comes from um comes
from our Lord and savior Linda Lovelace uh oh there's a lot about Linda Lovelace
we won't get into it here but uh fascinating figure though um historic figure
but like I I just changed the world her and Indira Gandhi yeah so like I I but
then again like there I am again like a few days later being like developing
these very Vivid fantasies yeah um and then once again just being let down being
let down um and I found that the people that I like being around the most are
the people that I liked spending time around with clothes on maybe not with
clothes on but you know not doing sexual things yeah um and so like for about
seven years this has been this has been dodging me seven to ten years like what
what is going on with me and so I talked to a friend and sort of describe that
like describe this things and you said okay when you have your sexual fantasies
when you kind of you know go off on your own head are they about you and I'm
like no they're about circumstances and situations I make up sometimes sexual
characters and he's like okay you're a good sexual you're what a ego sexual a
bit of a mouthful but when the original studies were done on asexuality so
you're full of yourself the researcher realized that there's a very strange
pattern among some of the research subjects where they have sexual desire they
desire desire but they didn't really have they didn't really find fulfillment in
sex or the original term was forgive me but Auto Crow is autocroisexuality which
was more of a mouthful than a ego sexual but the people of asexuals decided that
aego sexual is probably a better way to say it it means that you are the ego of
your sexuality and other people don't really have much effector in there it
means that you arouse yourself but not that you're aroused by yourself it's just
that your imagination does the lifting okay um and I I almost had a like
meltdown because I was like that's me how did I not know about this and he's
like that's because like so few people nobody talks no this exists um but unlike
a lot of other um like it's like women not having orgasms nobody talks about it
and so so many women just feel shame that they've never done the fact that we
didn't know that the clitoris was as large as it is until like the last 10 years
because we didn't research the in inside no one bothered to research what the
inside what the internal as someone who had to watch a lot of straight porn as a
teenager uh because I didn't have internet access and we had a pay-per-view
descrambler I don't know how straight men can't find the clitoris right it's not
hidden it anyway um lesbians have been finding it for Millennia uh so the
sexuality fandom uh Wikipedia describes it as being distinguished by the
tendency towards having sexual fantasies at times despite feeling a disconnect
between themselves and the sexual targets that's object of arousal my friend
described it as we desire desire uh this friend also identifies as he actually
went into gender studies specifically to study this and write a dissertation
about this I'd love to read it yeah uh he plays match of the Gathering now as
you would do a legacy format where all the Queer as furries and uh Communists
are uh and aegosexual actually means sexuality without the sex a ego sexuality
um so I like to participate in sex as a living sort of subject I examine myself
as a fantasy person so that's that's the context that I like having sex and
that's why I like don't like doing it that often Because the actual sensation is
of having it is less than the imagined sensation of what it appears or how it
appears yeah um it's like people who have you know in their fantasies they have
you know maybe an extreme Kink that would be you know not necessarily like
violence or anything but something that most people would be like I found some
of those but then in real life they're just kind of like oh no I would never
actually do it yeah yeah and so like when I say that or they did or they would
and then it would ruin the fantasy but yeah when I say that asexual people can
be some of the horniest and kinkiest people you're leveling ever Evelyn ever
encounter it's because that outside of the puritism purism of asexuality there
are a myriad of different ways that the human brain is just really weird about
sex yeah not weird isn't bad but weird as in like it's it's complicated it's
complicated uh it's like she's complex but um so yeah like there are these are
things that are the subject of research and the subject of academic Fascination
even if there isn't really a lot of academic interest in these things some
people are we're gonna see start seeing a little bit more of this um but there
is a bit of a distinction between these between you know these sort of more
psychological elements of asexual and the more self-identifying ones which you
know there are legion of flags um because you know the asexual Community has
been kind of ignored like we said by the queer community at large so I feel like
there is a over tendency to self-identify and to sort of construct a the version
of asexuality around a specific you know circumstances yeah and I feel like the
pure the gatekeeping the purest gatekeeping of asexual aromanticism has led to
that like you can't be asexual because you enjoy sex and these circumstances and
it's like but yeah I'm still you know I'm still weird about it um and so like
it's I I feel like this is a situation where self-identified having the openness
do I just identify self-identifies asexual meaning like I don't fit the sexual
Norm of either the CIS had hegemony or the queer community so I I need to belong
here because I don't belong anywhere anywhere else yeah um and I really hope we
can start moving towards that because I hate seeing so much fragmentation within
within sub communities yeah because it it does cut I feel like there is an
extent like yeah it's important to recognize the distinction between gays and
lesbians and bisexual people and how uh and especially trans people in the LGBT
and how the assistant hegemony uniquely persecutes against each of these camps
of people and yeah different cocktails of privilege that they might that gay men
will in particular kind of push back against all the other letters in the
alphabet well that's that's honey oh that's a whole that's a whole other
discussion I'm talking about how the persecution of a gay man is different than
a gay woman yeah um is different from bisexual man is different from a bisexual
and especially it gets different when you factor in people of color and how
these respective communities approach queerness very different uh and so like I
there is it is important to recognize the difference in discrimination and the
difference in the Dynamics of social dynamics as they fit into the society at
large but and so I feel like if if your version of this thing doesn't really
change the dynamic of persecution against issue or the manifestation of your
relationship with the culture and I don't I don't feel like it's like it's fine
if you want to kind of have this sort of label on yourself but make sure you're
putting the label there yourself don't let anyone else label you about you but
you yeah um that's fine but I feel like a formal definition or distinction of
this kind of does take away from a lot of the discussion especially when you get
CIS people straight people so straight people who are like there are so many
more letters than there used to be I just can't keep up and it's like don't try
yeah that's you know we made a whole video talking about why we need to just get
rid of the letters and just go first describing it to like um and a big part of
that I think is you know if there was Queer as an umbrella term then all the
different flavors of asexuality would be you know you would have you couldn't
devalue different kinds of asexual because you know they're all on the same Turf
as all the other ones that an asexual who is incredibly horny but only for a
specific type of person you know is on the same level as an asexual who has abs
absolutely no interest in sex whatsoever and they just want to you know play D D
um and that's one of the reasons I do think funny fact um people who play D get
laid more than you would believe but yeah that's that's like I said that's why I
think there should be an overarching term that isn't so uh and I don't blame the
the fragmentation on individuals needing to be special Stars I blame it on
purist gatekeeping oh absolutely and that's kind of I know I want to be clear
about that like I you know like the the gold star gay yeah thing the Platinum
star gay yeah I had a C-section yeah like I was born via C-section were you yeah
oh I wasn't 48 hours at Labor beforehand but um before we continue we will do
one last break and uh then we'll come back with our final thoughts and welcome
back to the show gaze Behaving Badly that's what we're called we haven't really
behaving that badly today so yeah in you know closing thoughts section would be
kind of uh you were saying that uh we just watched hell of a boss uh yeah and
you watched the husband hotel which was the thing that's spun off of yeah and
you said that there is an asexual character and you quite enjoyed that well
they're identified in the wiki as asexual like they don't say it in the show but
because you know they only have one episode he only Pops in at the end of the
episode um but the Creator and the in the wiki they are I think identified as
asexual um and I thought that was cool because basically has been between has
been hotel and hell of a boss every letter of the eye every one of them um
because apparently even in Hell of the boss Moxie is bisexual I buy that which I
didn't I I didn't Roxy's the cute little boy right well he's not a little boy
but like he's a no Boi like he's yeah he's adorable he's a boy um I mean like I
buy that like not that pegging or getting pegged makes you buy makes you queer
but like but um I I've seen him kind of be flustered around the boys yeah yeah
but yeah there's you know a character who is at least in the wiki identified as
asexual and you wouldn't guess it from his character because you know he's not
the Sheldon or the data or the and he I like that in hell of a boss uh
monogamous is the um is the taboo that's the one that nobody likes to talk about
or like is hell yeah yeah I I just really really enjoyed that sort of flipping
the script yeah but I would like to see more of that going forward even if it's
if it's characters that are uh identified as asexual that would be great but for
whom the well like ASAP like asexual does like does there need to be a
declaration made or sort of a specification made or is just the plot
acknowledging that there is no romantic future for this character that sounds so
Bleak but there is no intended romantic future for this character yeah um and
this character is comfortable with that yeah is just writing that into the
character and into the plot enough or a is that good enough or does there need
to be a soapbox moment yeah and I mean that's that's kind of a question with gay
stuff too is it okay to just have a gay character who is a great character or do
they have to have a boyfriend to confirm the gayness yeah um you know it's like
in wakanda forever there is a lesbian character and she's pretty badass
throughout the movie she only has you know that one moment where it's confirmed
that she is queer and a lot of people say you know that's really good
representation and a lot of people say that doesn't count because it can be
sucked out for for screening which it is being it's the movie's not getting a
Chinese a Chinese release um but it is being um uh it has been requested to be
removed by Kuwait um so it's short enough to be removed and so does it count if
it is so insubstantial that it is removable yeah that's a whole other discussion
that'll be a video yeah not necessarily about wakanda forever but about that
whole thing when it comes to gay people I like I I don't like having the soapbox
moment because I don't think straight when you have gay representation when you
want to have gay representation straight people don't need gay representation
gay people need gay queer people need queer representation yeah um so having
that soapbox moment where you explain to queer P to straight people that it's
okay to be gay that's not useful to us because we already have these messages we
already have and the ways that gay people or queer people would interpret
self-acceptance is different than the way that straight people wouldn't
interpret accepting queer people yeah so there's need to be two very different
manifestations of how this media handles that thing and you know with a gay
character I think you know I I am growing more okay with the incidental well I
like the incidentally queer characters um the ones that there is no soapbox
moment yeah I like it if maybe they actively show their attraction to someone of
the same sex but for an asexual character I think it would be enough like lose
from the owl house I think that is like she's not asexual bisexual she's
bisexual but like that kind kind of attitude where it's apparent but it's never
made a deal out of no one really questions and she doesn't need to get in a
soapbox because everyone's like oh okay yeah but with an asexual character I
think it would be enough to have another character kind of say you know like the
stereotypical you just need to get laid Yeah like oh you're stressed out you
just need to get laid and then be like I don't like doing that but yeah like and
then that's enough and I've always kind of felt like there are ways instead of
having that soapbox moment driving that identification you can do that but also
there are ways that uh queer people asexual people bisexual people they interact
with the world differently than other people of different sort of camps yeah so
as long as you write that in and you do it earnestly and I think your opinion as
an asexual person your opinion on this matters more than mine but like I also
don't want to speak for the entire Ace Community I think that you do need a
balance of soapbox moments as well as you need to have that incidental
incidental representation yeah like I feel like the soapbox moments should be
like on Disney plus we all be made on for TV shows for movies for kids and
teenagers but I think you also need that mix of uh fastos from um eternals where
like his motivation was Inseparable from his you know really from his gay gay
marriage oh yeah absolutely yeah um I I do think that kind of representation is
important I think we need a mix and that's the thing that you know CIS straight
Holly males old white yeah they think they get is that they think okay this is
how we do representation instead of as a formula because it's like as long as we
do this and they'll be happy and it's like think but you got to do other things
too and it's like that's too much yeah like I think which which and that's like
a sort of thing which representation do we use for this media and it's like you
need to let a creative person do that in which they point they their heads start
spinning around and they start throwing up um the soup and God forbid let a
creative person do something so I think that's kind of the message of this is
Maybe Maybe to any Executives listening let the creative people tell the stories
because you know there are plenty of straight people who've told great gay
stories God knows there's plenty of gay people who've told great straight
stories right and there are plenty of people out there who are asexual who have
stories to tell that might be hilarious comedies or might be very oh asexuality
is absolutely hilarious I can everything that I've kind of said in here that's
kind of like oh poor Nick no it can be funny with a different well yeah I look
at the same time like like it can be really funny stories they can be comedies
they could be dramas and they have stories to tell so maybe let them tell them
instead of having someone who is definitely not asexual say this is what I think
one of them is okay so that's the end of the first episode of gays Behaving
Badly yeah tell us what you think we know you will yeah um I know you will um if
you liked it let us know in the comments if you didn't um if you liked our show
tell everyone that if you think this sucks keep your pig it's from it's the um
the uh I've heard that before it's from The Producers it's their Encore all
right right yeah um so yeah let us know in the comments if you like this style
if so we'll do one a month um and if there's any topics that we try to avoid as
a community but you think are kind of important to talk about leave them down in
the comments um so until maybe next month or the next video or the next podcast
or the next padreon or whatever next thing whatever's happening next my name is
James I'm Nick and thank you for watching the first episode of gays Behaving
Badly go behave badly [Music] thank you
