Since it premiered in 2013, the *Attack on Titan* anime has been called "the greatest anime ever produced", "the most overrated anime ever produced", and "the most dangerous anime ever produced". But which opinion is right? Maybe, just maybe... they're all wrong.

I didn't watch *Attack on Titan* at first because I was in my "anime is for kids" phase and only really got into it earlier this year when countless people online were telling me how gay the relationship between Levi
and Erwin was. After watching the show... I have no idea what they were talking about. I don't see gay going on anywhere between these two. 

Historia and Ymir? Yes! Obviously! Ymir loudly proclaimed that she wanted to marry Historia. 

Jean and Marco? Absolutely! In my mind, they loved each other. But Marco didn't live long enough to see anything come of it.

But Levi and Erwin? I just don't see it. But even though I didn't see the gayness, your ship is valid. ðŸ˜Š 

Regardless, I still found myself becoming utterly transfixed by this show, to the point where I ended up
watching all 87 episodes in about three days. But not everyone is so in love with the series. The show and manga on which its base have been attacked for portraying the Eldians (the race of people who live inside the walls) as an analog for Jewish people. And since Eldians can turn into man-eating monsters -- something Jewish people have been accused of being able to do in the past, believe it or not -- the analogous connection has made more than a few people... uneasy.

The fact that actual white nationalists have tried to embrace *Attack on Titan* as a story that expresses *their* theory the Jews are purposefully oppressing and attempting to eliminate European people through mass migration and... *brainwashing* hasn't helped the show's defense.

Many of these people are embracing it not for its representation of a Jewish analogy as fighting to survive against a much larger force, but as a defense of white nationalism. They seem to see the opposite of what normal fans see. They see themselves as the oppressed Eldians while the oppressing Marleyans are the Jewish analog to them, because they failed every media literacy course they ever took.

But they still gravitate toward the story nonetheless, which many find problematic. I say we shouldn't be letting the alt-right take ownership of... well anything, but that's me. 

So yeah. *Attack on Titan* is handling incredibly charged issues and bringing some extremely radical people into its midst, some of whom appear to be rooting for the mass genocide at the end of the story. Rather than realizing that every lead character, minus one, from the first three seasons sees it as awful and wrong. Most of the show's principles are articulated in a clumsy manner and it's clear why some people have been alarmed by how it's portrayed. 

That doesn't excuse people from not being fair to the show simply because some members of the alt-right enjoy it in some ways though. *Attack on Titan* may not be inherently fascist, but it speaks to a fascist urge. In *Attack on Titan*, the nature of oppressor and oppressed is fluid and ambiguous. The humanity stuck between those who assume these identities don't really recognize or comprehend them. 

When their skulls are crushed and the survivors reflect on watching their loved ones perish in agony, all that is left of our life stories are the deeply personal horrors of humankind's inhumanity toward other humans, and the horror that your precious life can be drained from your body in an instant by forces you do not even comprehend. 

So let's bite into this world -- Let's rip open the nape of its neck -- and see what's inside this franchise that has become one of the best-selling mangas in history, one of the most watched animes ever, and one of the most hotly debated pieces of media of the new millennium.

Soon Eren and his comrades come upon a sentient *female* Titan while exploring the forest between the walls, and eventually identify her as their fellow soldier Annie Leonhart. Eren battles Annie and defeats her with the help of his other soldiers, but Annie encases herself in a crystal form and is hidden away from the public.

With help from his friends, Eren fights and defeats Annie, who encases herself in crystal and is put in custody. During the fight, it is discovered that there are Titans lying dormant within the walls. Shortly after, Titans mysteriously appear within the walls with no evidence of how they got in, accompanied by the sentient Beast Titan. Ymir, one of the new Survey Corps graduates, reveals that she can also transform into the sentient Jaw Titan, while Ymir's close friend Christa Lenz reveals herself as Historia Reiss, a member of the royal bloodline. Two other members of the team, Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover reveal themselves as the Armored Titan and Colossal Titan respectively, and attempt to kidnap Eren, but fail.

Soon after, the intelligent Beast Titan and other mindless Titans mysteriously appear within the walls without leaving any signs of how they got there. One of the newest survey corps grads, Ymir, reveals that she can also change into an intelligent Titan: the Jaw Titan. And a girl named Krista, who Ymir is in love with, reveals herself to be Historia Reiss, a descendant of the ancient royal family.

Season 3: the "Shit gets complicated" season.

The survey corps is being targeted by military police, led by Kenny Ackerman, Levi's Uncle, while Eren and his companions join Levi's Squad. They learn that Historia and her father, Rod Reiss, are the only living members of the royal dynasty, and that the current king is a pretender on the throne. They also learn that one can acquire the abilities of another Titan shifter by transforming into a Mindless Titan and eating it.

Rod Reiss kidnaps Eren and reveals that Eren is in possession of not only the Attack Titan, but the *Founding* Titan, which Eren's father Grisha acquired after eating Rod's daughter, Frieda Reiss, the day the wall fell, and then passed it along to his son. After a violent altercation in which Historia decides to rebuff her father's demands to become a Titan, Rod drinks Titan spinal fluid and becomes a gigantic Abnormal Titan, but is killed by Historia, who is then crowned queen.

With the pretender king now off the throne, the Survey Corps leads a successful operation to recapture Shiganshina, fighting the Beast, Colossal, Armored, and Cart Titans, but suffering massive casualties, including Eren's best friend Armin, who is nearly killed by the Colossal Titan. But Armin is turned into a Titan himself and acquires ownership of the Colossal Titan by eating Bertholdt. While Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan, and is then at least partially avenged by Levi being the absolute biggest badass of badasses. 

Then Eren and his comrades return to the ruins of his childhood home, where they learn the truth about their world: that they are Eldians, sworn opponents of the imperialist Marleyans, and were imprisoned within the walls after the original King Fritz fled the conflict. They are not, as they were informed, the 'last people alive', but rather a small sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis.

Over the course of the next year, the Survey Corps kill all the remaining Pure Titans on the island and, for the first time in their lifetimes, make it to the sea, where Eren resolves to wipe out the enemies across the water.

Season 4, Part 1: the "What happened to my favorite character?" season.

Across the sea, Marley continues to oppress their Eldian population, treating them like dirt, turning them into mindless Titans and sending them to fight wars of expansion for them, and brainwashing most of them into thinking that they're evil, and can only be redeemed by becoming a Titan and fighting for them.

Three years after killing off the last of the Titans on Paradis, the Survey Corps attacked Marley's Capital, Liberia, led by Eren and his half-brother Zeke, the Beast Titan. Eren kills Willy Tybur, an Eldian who had been controlling Marley from the shadows, and takes custody of the until now unseen War Titan. After eating its former owner, Willy's sister Lara.

Eren had infiltrated Marley and gained the trust of several of its citizens before this, leaving his friends in the dark as to where he was or what he was doing. So once the attack is over and Eren is back home, he is imprisoned but escapes with the help of a group of fanatical soldiers who have dedicated themselves to Eren, known as the Yeagerists. 

Zeke, who is revealed to have Royal Blood and therefore special Titan abilities, is imprisoned by Levi, but manages to escape, but not before Levi does some serious damage to him. Meanwhile, Marley's air fleet, led by Reiner, launches an attack on Paradis.

Season 4, Part 2: the "exposition" season.

Eren and Zeke managed to come together, which takes them to the Paths, an interconnected set of gateways connecting all the subjects of Ymir through time and space, where they encounter the mind of Ymir, the original Titan.

\[Briefly not filtered]: (Not the lesbian Ymir, a different one.)

Whose tortured past has kept her in prison for thousands of years within the Paths, building the world's Titans out of sand, one-by-one. Zeke tries to persuade Ymir to grant his request of sterilizing all the subjects of Ymir, her descendants, therefore ending the Titan threat forever, and ending the suffering of all Eldians. However, Eren persuades Ymir instead to unleash the Rumbling, letting loose those thousands of colossal-like Titans held within the walls of Paradis and guiding them on a genocidal march to slaughter everyone outside the island. To stop Eren's maniacal mission, the former leadership of the Survey Corps joins forces with the remaining Marleyan forces, including Reiner and a decrystallized Annie.

Season 4, part 3: the "manga ending and maybe anime ending?" season.

After an apocalyptic battle atop Eren's eldritch horror of a final form, Levi kills Zeke and a mysterious monster that is the source of all the Titan's powers, leaving Mikasa to kill Eren, causing the Titans' power to vanish and release every person who had been transformed into a Titan. It's revealed that what happened was part of Eren's plan all along, because he could see the future and the past, and was basically omniscient there for a bit. 

As the rest of the world is rebuilding, Armin and his comrades begin peace talks, led by Queen Historia. Mikasa buries Eren beneath a tree on a hill in Shiganshina District, but, over time, the world does not see peace. Instead only new forms of warfare, as is the nature of humankind. Their home District of Shiganshina is turned to rubble in one such conflict, and the series concludes with a boy approaching the giant tree that has grown around Eren's grave, which bears a striking resemblance to the tree in which Ymir connected with the progenitor of the Titan's power millennia ago.

## Chapter 2: Fascist Adoption

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

To a large extent, people started feeling uneasy about *Attack on Titan* once the manga explained the Titan's origins, finally answering the series spanning question "what is in Eren's family's House's basement?" 

Eren's father Grisha left behind a journal outlining that the outside world isn't uninhabited at all. That there is a wide world out beyond the walls. The people of Paradis are of a race called Eldians. All of whom have the ability to transform into Titans under certain circumstances. Who are the descendants of the first Titan, Ymir. And in this outside world, Eldians are corralled into ghettos and forced to wear armbands to distinguish them. 

They spend their lives being told how their Titan ancestors ruled the world with an Iron Fist and that they must atone for the sins of their tyrannical ancestors, regardless of the fact that there isn't really any *proof* that said Eldian empire ever actually existed. Its existence is only spoken of by people who would have been told about it via anti-Eldian propaganda. Regardless the people of Marley, the continent across the shores from Paradis, constantly fear the reprisal of this mythical Eldian war machine, where the wicked Eldians from Paradis will rise up and use the power of the Titans to rule or destroy the world once more. So Eldians in Marley, who live inside ghettos, must toil in labor to prove that they aren't like the devils from within the walls of Paradis.

Eren's father held different philosophy, that the founding Titan Ymir was actually a benevolent goddess. She used her Titan blood to carve roads, erect grand buildings, and defend her people from the interloping forces. And that it was the people of Marley who jealously seized the power of the Titans, cast Ymir's descendants away, and forged a false history of propaganda to suppress those Eldians who did not flee to Paradis. Grisha Yeager believed that the Eldians were not devils, but the chosen people of God, which in Euro-American rhetoric, "chosen people of God" carries a very specific meaning. And in conjunction with the ghettos and armbands, there seems to be a direct comparison.

This leads some viewers who interpret this storyline as being *too similar* to anti-semitic conspiracies which typically assert the Jewish people govern the world via some sort of ancient illuminati-esque cabal. For instance there is a well-respected Eldian family in Marley, the Tibers, who owe their honorary Marleyan and status to their role in driving the Eldian royalty away from the continent a hundred years ago. And though they may be Eldian, the Tiber family has, for generations, used their wealth and influence to manipulate global politics. Which may mirror real-world conspiracies that say that secret Jewish organizations already secretly run the world.

This facet of the show has helped others, such as Dot Pixis's character, to stand out. The creator and writer, Hajime Isayama, has said that the character of Pixis, a military general, was based on the real life World War II General Akiyama Yoshifuru, who Isayama said he respected and is revered by many in Japan, despite having committed war crimes, particularly in Korea.

<james {% include timecode %} span="2">

This outrage should come as no surprise, knowing the history between Japan and Korea. But that is exactly what most people may not be aware of. Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 to 1945, only one of many East Asian nations colonized by Japan as part of its growing Imperial presence at the time. 

During which the Japanese Army enforced changing Korean names to Japanese style, destroyed and stole Korean cultural artifacts and locations, murdered the Korean empress, forced Korean men into hazardous war efforts, forced Korean women into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers, and tortured and massacred and experimented upon Koreans en masse. 

However, history books and classes in Japan have glossed over it, if not outright ignored these events, much like North American History books like to gloss over the genocide of the indigenous peoples of this continent.

Isayama's statement about this, which came from a 2010 blog post before *Attack on Titan* was published, led to death threats against the author. Because *everything* leads to death threats these days. Which ends up delegitimizing your argument, because no matter what he believes, *you* threatened to kill him, so now he's the victim.

And before you turn around and say "how dare he commit war crimes", please examine how we white westerners prop up the likes of Winston Churchill, who ignored the deaths of three million East Indians, then British subjects, and other figures like... American president Teddy Roosevelt, who said 

\[Quote shown on screen]:

We take for granted that they're pillars of our culture, because they gave a speech or something, regardless that they were privy to massacres and genocide. In our own culture, there is such an air of veneration around these figures, the criticism is almost a cultural taboo. it's not uncommon for creators to have problematic views, ones which are rooted in their own cultural upbringing. even leftists give a pass to FDR as being a great president, and ignore the fact that he locked up hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II, but nobody calls *him* a fascist. (Well, Republicans might, but not for the right reasons.)

Some have even gone so far as to call *Attack on Titan* *itself* fascist and anti-semitic. Because while *Attack on Titan* does have a large fandom of... *normal* people, it also has a notable and Loud right-wing fan base. The New Republic even dubbed it "the alt-right's favorite manga".

Anime fans have gotten themselves into a tangle trying to decipher where Isayama draws the line between the metaphors he engages in and his own personal convictions. But *Attack on Titan* contradicts Isayama's apparent nationalism.

Would Armin not be as put off by the alt-right adopting the anime as he is by the actually very fascist Yeagerists? Bearing in mind that all the main characters in the show end up fighting against Eren's imperialist march across the world in the end. To me, this raises an important question: if the alt-right is under the impression that a piece of media is *for* them... are we just gonna roll over and let them have it?

With content like... say *Fight Club*, should we just relinquish this media because the right famously has such poor media literacy that they do not realize it's actually making a mockery of them? The novel on which the film is based was written by Chuck Palahniuk, a gay author whose career is marked by satire and subversion. He sought to criticize toxic masculinity by first pointing out how inherently gay masculinity and firming rituals actually are. And secondly by highlighting that the boys will go to any lengths to prove their masculinity. 

The message of *Fight Club* is not that boys should not talk about Fight Club. It's that maybe boys *should* talk about their feelings, or else they might be persuaded to commit domestic terrorism. Instead of fighting for this media's direct subtextual meaning and holding on to it in spite of the right wing following, we just roll over and let them add another piece of media to their library. The problem being... the larger this collection of "lib-owning" content grows, the more credible they feel.

Alternately, and this concerns me, I've begun to wonder if the left also lacks the media literacy needed to properly gauge that *Fight Club* is specifically subverting the values and sensibilities that the protagonists represent. An unfortunate trend I've noticed, specifically in American film criticism, is that analysts don't seem to understand that they're not always meant to identify with the values of the main character just because they're the main character. Sometimes, the protagonist is the villain. As is the case with the nameless protagonist of *Fight Club*.

But is this the case with Eren Jaeger? Especially, as the series reaches its apocalyptic conclusion. As *Attack on Titan* comes to a close, the question becomes how to interact with it. And also whether or not a show can handle fascist ideas in the manner with which it does without being fascist and anti-semitic itself. Isayama declined to comment on the topic, saying

You've probably seen some of the show's recognizable symbols, especially its military insignia, even if you haven't seen the anime or read the manga it's based on. If anything, you've probably heard portions of the iconic first season theme song, which is a banger.

\[Plays potion of theme song] 

The show introduced many people to anime and manga, which is what makes criticism so tricky. It's hard to criticize one's first love. However being unable or unwilling to address the problems in *Attack on Titan*'s fictional world has caused a... long simmering unresolved conflict within the anime fandom.

## Chapter 3: Inner Meaning

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

At first sight, *Attack on Titan* seems like it could be easily written off as plainly pro-fascist. The central character *is* a pro-military fanatic who uses his pariah status to justify mass extinction. The militarism of the story is reflected in the opening sequence of the anime's first season, with the lyric "I am a soldier"

Granted, when it comes to all things fashy<sup class="add">[eg, fascist-like]</sup> in *Attack on Titan*, viewers always have to read into it. Characters never specifically come out and talk *about* fascism, either methods or ideology. In specific terms, this may include discussion about oppression, indoctrination, propaganda, and dehumanization of a national enemy. And while all of these elements may be deployed in a fascist regime, they are not exclusive *to* fascism. 

In fact not all fascism is the same. The term is often deployed against things that specifically draw from the posturing and methodology of the Third Reich. Though, while it *is true* to say that all Nazis were fascist, not all fascists were Nazis. That said, when it comes to the specific elements of *Attack on Titan* that are implicitly drawn from the Third Reich, these elements are mostly visual. The Eldian ghettos in Marley are never *called* "ghettos", for instance. We pick up on that from the way they directly resemble ghettos from the 30s and 40s. 

When it comes to what is written, the depiction of fascism is much more generalized. Routinely dialogue leans toward valuing people based on how they can serve the military. This is present in both the forces of Paradis and Marley. What good you are to society is dependent upon how you can advance the agenda of the state. However the bulk of the show's latent fascist moralization is focused on Erin Yeager.

And especially his cult of personality, the Yeagerists. This is a group that grew out of a branch of the military, specifically the branch that had been depicted heroically from the first three seasons, the Survey Corps. The scouts themselves were depicted as plucky, desperate dreamers. They reached for the impossible and they kept getting up no matter how bad they got beaten down, time and time again. This is a common an underdog trope in itself, and is not out of place among contemporary pop culture.

However, as Eren became a more pivotal figure to the Survey Corps' victories, even though Eren himself was often ancillary, many within the Survey Corps and Paradis as a whole come to venerate him and his agenda. Just as season 4 doubles down on fascistic undertones, it *perhaps* begins to explore the finer points of fascistic ideology. 

Within fascism, there is typically a belief that death is the most significant contribution that one can make to society. Which is brought up multiple times throughout seasons one, two, and three. In many fascist states, there is a warrior mythology around seeking out a worthy death. A worthy death is almost always a death which is of assistance to the reigning leadership. 

This is a component of why white nationalists often lean into Norse mythology. As it goes, entry into Valhalla is earned through a warrior's death, dying in battle. The most common way to die in battle was to be in an army.

\[Meme cutaway to Mad Max characters shouting "Witness me!!!!!"]

This isn't to say that all Nordic culture itself was fascist. The concept of a good death was a religious one that spanned across the whole culture, rather than in service to a single ruler. That isn't to say that rulers would not *exploit* this, but the purpose of a good death was intrinsic rather than appealing to a concept of the greater good. Rhetoric around "the greater good" itself is a pivotal element of *Attack on Titan*. And especially in season 4, we see otherwise identifiable characters committing atrocities in the name of "the greater good"; such as the once relatively innocent Arman.

Eren himself befits a mythological warrior status, a figure who is<sup class="add">[sic: has]</sup> seemingly supernatural powers, and whose objectives are unwaveringly aligned with the defense or expansion of the homeland. The warrior must possess the characteristics that the state wants the collective to embody. However, the discourse on "deathworthiness" is not limited to one side of this fictional conflict. And an interpretation of Eren depends on whether the series is depicting him sympathetically or critically.

Some may interpret Eren as a heroic figure, who is making the tough but necessary decision to do what needs to be done. Some interpret him as a national figure who is returning a persecuted nation to its former glory. To others... he is *super Hitler*!

These viewpoints are represented by different characters in the story and they can be found on *very* different sides of the conflict. But there's very little framing to moralize this specifically. It seems to be taken for granted that Eren's actions are *evil?* or necessary. 

While Eren himself is fascist-coded, and while his cult the Yeagerists are *brazenly* fascist, does that mean the show itself is fascist? Eren was, after all, the POV character who is more or less the audience's cipher for the beginning of the series. But it's important to remember that the protagonist of a story is not necessarily the hero.

Literarily speaking, a protagonist is simply the character for whom the narrative follows. Given that Eren is committing a literal genocide, I think it's safe to reason that he is the series's principal villain. This narrative device isn't uncommon. A hero who uses their power to become a monster is a plot device from Frank Herbert's *Dune*. It's present in the *Star Wars* prequels, and can even be seen in ancient myths like Heracles. 

When gauging weather *Attack on Titan* itself is fascist, it comes down to how these characters are framed. And the consensus in *Attack on Titan* from literally *every other* main character is that Eren... *maybe* needs to chill. Bearing in mind that detractors of the series point out that the principal characters of Armin and Mikasa, Eren's childhood friends, attempt to justify his actions at the end of the series. 

That said, we don't have to look at them as heroic either. Armin had been dropping fascist-adjacent lines since season one.

And Mikasa is so obsessed with Eren, to the point of being completely incapable of escaping him. At the end of the manga, Isayama punctuated that by having a bird land on her shoulder and lift her scarf over her neck, just as Eren said he would always be there to do. She is trapped for the rest of her life by the very memory of him.

That should not excuse these characters for sure. They are letting personal feelings cloud their judgment of someone who is very obviously willing and able to commit genocide. With so many main characters joining into these sentiments (which if they are not fascists, they are certainly violent ones) does the audience have a character with whom their viewpoints are meant to be reflected? *Except* maybe Jean; he doesn't really do anything horrible during the series.

Even Historia, while inclined towards acts of kindness, is indicative of the rightful ruler trope in fiction, which ends up itself amounting to royalist propaganda. And while fascism is not defined by the lack of democracy, monarchy and oligarchy aren't really that much better. And while the day is saved from the bad monarch, a good monarch is still totalitarian nevertheless.

How do we read that? How do we read any of this? Because especially when it comes to the aforementioned fascistic coding, there seems to be no clear pattern for how these coded messages play out in the plot.

Sometimes a character's death yields opportunity. Other times it's just a pointless slaughter. Sometimes military decorum and discipline holds the line and keeps the group together. Other times it functions as cultish indoctrination. These themes are so fast and loose in the series that I can see the evidence for where some people could read it as fascist, and others could read it as specifically anti-fascist.

And it's not like fascist-esque imagery and Anime and manga is rare. On the subject, anime YouTuber Joe Yang said:

> "It's important to note that the use of fascistic, war, or even Nazi imagery is not necessarily an endorsement of these ideas or regimes, as strange as it may sound."

The fascist and anti-semitic elements in *Attack on Titan* shouldn't be controversial to bring up. The question the audience and the critics need to answer is whether or not the series is actively *harmful* because of them. That is, whether the audience is directed to sympathize with characters and themes that represent and are represented by these elements.

Some media commentators even admitted to not watching *Attack on Titan* because they were afraid of the backlash they would receive for discussing the show's political undertones. YouTuber Jeff THU argues:

> "It's because this discussion keeps happening, but it's also not. There's some really good criticism of Attack on Titan, and I think it's important to criticise it, but a lot of people come at it strong and condemn it.
>
> That does as much to kill the conversation as people being like, 'shut the hell up about politics,' because it reinforces the argument that people are just trying to cancel this good show that you like."

For a long time, anime fans had no way of knowing what their favorite writers and artists even looked like, let alone what they thought about the world. Anime fans have generally avoided discussing the political content of their favorite shows because the art form was, until recently, a niche that was sometimes wrongly characterized as being obscene and dangerous. Given the cultural status in Japan of animation as a medium and not a genre, there are venues for animation to receive prestigious acclaim that is typically denied to animation in America. The equivalent of rejecting all anime due to sweeping generalizations is like shunning all live-action movies because porn is also live action.

Andrea Horbinski, a scholar with a doctorate in New Media studies and history, said:

> "Some Anglophone and American anime fans say that politics in anime is too foreign to comprehend.
>
> A lot more people these days seem to have some accurate knowledge about the socio-cultural politics in Japan,
>
> but in my experience they're equally likely to combine a dollop of knowledge about current circumstances in Japan with their own preconceptions about Japan and Japanese Society.
>
> Ironically, while it's never been easier to access cultural and political discussions directly from Japan thanks to the internet, relying on their own preconceptions,
>
> and only taking on board information that supports them, definitely does keep anime fans in this position from appreciating the range of views in anime generally."

This may color certain anime viewers perceptions of shows with feminist or queer themes, as well as shows like *Attack on Titan*. Right-wing anime viewers, according to herbinsky, demand the inclusion of western-style political themes. As they put it:

> "These fans insist that feminism and LGBTQ people don't exist in Japan and that any anime depicting either is woke garbage or similar.
>
> These fans are extremely angry at attempts to discuss the depictions of female characters in anime as something that could often use improvement, or the inclusion of LGBT characters period.
>
> They may cite 'evidence' to support their views that is wholly out of context. Attempts by Japanese feminists and LGBTQ activists to provide corrective information online do not go down well, particularly on Twitter."

Which is funny, because these kinds of regressionists praise anime for its narrative complexity, but at the same time deny the presence of political complexity. At least when it's politics that challenges their preconceptions. Again we're in a situation where media "being political" only really applies to media that promotes opinions outside the viewer's comfort zone. Regardless if that media, as *Attack on Titan* does, borrows heavily from real world politics and historical references. There is a contingent of the audience who is so over-accustomed to having their viewpoints unchallenged that they will default to an assumption that the media they enjoy is simple and uncomplicated.

But the question remains: does media owe you simplicity?

## Chapter 4: Part One: Mistaken Significance


 huh why am I suddenly wearing different clothes and in a whole other setting for part four that seems a bit jarring doesn't it oh well you can't really say that *Attack on Titan* is overly simple or about nothing there are innumerous instances where characters go out of their way to specifically outline what the audience should be taking away from a given Arc at least in the English dub which may not be the best way to convey messaging across to your audience if you treat people like they're too dumb to pick up on what's going on
they won't develop the tools needed to read into messaging in other media people
become how you treat them which in itself could be a theme within Attack on
Titan ironically probably the greatest challenge in the field of literary
analysis is how to gauge whether there even is intended subtext in a literary
work and this isn't necessarily limited to genre either Jane Austen wrote what
is ostensibly Chiclet in terms of plot beats and characters however it is fairly
clear in her work that she was very consciously writing commentary and criticism
of the English Gentry sometimes there is social commentary that is overlooked
because of genre take Edgar Allan Poe for instance who during his lifetime was
dismissed by American literary canon for writing Gothic horror pulp the gothic
genre was seen as being far too rooted in sensationalist European sensibilities
and at the time the American literary scene was rooted in the idea that to be
legitimate one must be as serious and boring as possible indeed Poe had an avid
French fan base and was a significant source of inspiration for Jules Verne
relocation to Europe may have turned him into a respected author instead Poe
remained in America and died nearly destitute apologizing for being such a bad
writer and it was not until another generation rediscovered his work and began
to see a great deal of poignant and relevant commentary within it the same could
be said of Stan Lee who longed to write the Great American novel while comic
books are often criticized by literary Scholars as barely more valuable than the
pulp that they're historically printed on it was not until the end of his life
that Lee realized that through his contributions to Marvel Spider-Man in
particular he had created a significant contribution to American Literature
generally speaking though anytime it comes to populous media that is media that
is popular there is a tendency among the media Illuminati to dismiss it the
thought process being if many people see the value of this media then it must be
relying on Cheap Thrills to collect its audience yes because Homer rhyming off
the ancestors of Rich patrons reimagined as Heroes of the Trojan War is
absolutely not that however it can also work the opposite way where audiences
learned Scholars especially can read meaning into something where it was not
intended does Homer's wine dark sea actually function as a grand and poetic
description of the sea in a particular light or is it just something he had to
throw in to flush out the extra syllable to keep up the meter unfortunately it's
difficult to really gauge instances of this oftentimes authors are open about
fans reading unintended meanings into their books though will welcome the
additional analysis artists themselves exist in this world and there are any
number of unknown biases they may manifest in their work it's unlikely for
instance that Stephanie Meyer a Mormon intended to write a book about a girl who
has sex once gets pregnant and dies but here we are but in many cases I can see
authors leaning into unintended analysis of their media whether it's
subliminally or not it came from them so they can take the credit suffice to say
it's almost unheard of that the creator of a celebrated and acclaimed work of
academic art will come forward and say you're full of [Â __Â ] almost unheard of
for those of you who have endured an English Lit 101 class or did any kind of
digging into modernist poetry you've probably heard of earn Mali with classic
lines such as I am still the Black Swan of trespass on alien Waters that
rabbit's foot I carried in my left pocket has worn a hemorrhage in the lining
the pond lilies could not stifle the green Descent of frogs sounds deep right
for a very brief time earn mali's poems were the toast of Australian modernism
however there was a problem earn Mali didn't exist the radical shifting
landscape of art and culture after the first world war gave rise to different
artistic movements and while these new formats were embraced quite widely not
everyone was on board enter Australian writers James McCauley and Harold Stewart
who set out to prove that all this new poetry was Much Ado About Nothing they
edited a couple of existing poems and wrote a couple of new ones to be what they
consider to be bad writing and developed a tragic backstory for the late Ern
Mali and mailed off the poems but even after they were revealed to be a hoax
earn Mali remained a celebrity poet even though people knew he was fake poets
especially in America and England believe that Stuart and McCauley had
outsmarted themselves and that in the process of trying to create nonsense they
somehow managed to reach down and tap into true genius genius that they never
could reach in their own poetry in other words imagine your head is so far up
your ass that you would literally rather claim that your pranker is too stupid
to write bad poetry then admit that you suck at analyzing it but am I saying
that *Attack on Titan* is a modern day urn Mali no because from what we can gather
about it it's not trying to troll conventions in manga or anime it's very
earnestly trying to talk about trauma grief group think war and terrorism the
series will very deliberately orate what a viewer could simply observe the
series very much wants you to know that it's talking about specific things to
the point of coming out and just telling you this happens so often I think that
if the series was trying to make a statement about fascism and Military culture
it would have the characters actively engage in that discussion analyzing
literature is about looking for patterns and this is clearly the pattern that
*Attack on Titan* uses but when it comes to everything else that isn't directly
stated see the relevance of the urn Mali hoax doesn't just demonstrate that it
is possible to convince an audience to read meaning into nonsense The hoax shows
us that if an audience already believes there is meaning in a piece of media
there is little to nothing that can be done to convince them that the meaning
they read into it isn't there this fascist messaging in *Attack on Titan* almost
exclusively is presented in visual cues but isayama was horribly critical of his
own artistic abilities and may have simply borrowed the established fascist
looks instead of creating his own so other than that what's specifically about
*Attack on Titan* implores the audience to feel that there's anything that needs
to be read into it in the first place why read into this media in a way that you
would not look at what we do in the shadows as a complex commentary about
generational gaslighting entitlement and exploitation why do we look at one and
say no that's just pansexual vampires and then go to such lengths to justify a
fascist or non-fascist reading of the other I spoke about this before but
tragedy is almost universally held up as Superior forms of dramatic expression
next to Comedy this is almost entirely thanks to writings by Aristotle who felt
the drama was super carrier because it had the emotional ammunition capable of
imparting political and social messages onto the audience some may call that
propaganda but they risk having a black bag pulled over their head by the hit
squad of academics and taken away into an unmarked van so we're not going to say
that because I have more to do my simple rationale for why people may
specifically Scholars and intellectuals hold drama to be so significant is
because smart people tend to be sad it's a dull cruel world when you can
rationalize all the ways that Society is constructed to beat you down defaulting
to the self-evident truth that life is suffering we hold media that reflects
this suffering to be closer to a truth about The Human Experience a simpler
assessment would be the tragic media is emotionally exhausting to see your
Heroes best laid plans fail and to see beloved characters meet their end and to
see possibly hours of emotional investment end in sadness this takes its toll
perhaps we feel the need to read meaning into these things to justify the
emotional fatigue an *Attack on Titan* is certainly emotionally draining entire
episode arcs are spent to establish characters and within minutes not only are
they devoured alive but they are denied any satisfaction or dignity Time After
Time After Time plans fail Heroes fall and good people have everything taken
away from them even victories in *Attack on Titan* feel hollow and disappointing
everything is so gratuitously Bleak that at times it reaches this kind of Lemony
Snicket absurdity where anything that could possibly go wrong somehow does go
wrong where the plot is Twisted to scrape every shred of dignity away from these
characters who fought for the greater good tragedy and heartbreak seem to be the
only narrative beat it's willing to explore for the first three seasons the day
is only really saved because the main characters fail upwards almost by accident
for all the secret hidden abilities enemies have there's almost always a trump
card that the heroes couldn't have possibly foreseen resulting in a lot of dead
secondary characters in fact it's not until the fourth season where we see the
main characters essentially framed as the villains that they become competent
and that their plans are successful the series does have a pattern of characters
becoming alArmingly competent and Death Proof the second they become villains
these tragedies implore us to feel that there must be something to be said about
it that the audience is being pulled through this bleakness in order to get some
kind of human truth out of it or is tragedy using trauma in the way that comedy
use is levity that the dying and the suffering are merely present to give the
audience an outlet and keep them engaged in the series *Attack on Titan* presents
the message that war is senseless and has no meaning this is something the
characters actually do talk about however if we try to extract meaning from this
conflict when we are told that conflict is meaningless are we not giving meaning
to those fictional tragedies and if we can read meaning into fictitious War
what's stopping us from Reading meaning into actual meaningless War there is a
lot of stuff in *Attack on Titan* and yes there is the possibility that it's not
saying anything at all beyond the textual messaging of war is bad but when it
comes to the rampant discourse about whether this media supports fascist
ideology or whether it's subverting it there's a lot of strong evidence to point
in either direction as we've discussed the problem here is that messaging is
broadly applied and that there seems to be multiple different interpretations of
each character event and symbol the LDN people contain elements of a Jewish
analogy as per the Discrimination they face in Marley and the rhetoric around
being the chosen people of God however if Marley is seen as a Third Reich
analogy then the Nazis never used Elite Jewish combat units nor was there any
widespread success at fostering a sense of internalized self-loathing amongst
the Jewish people they were meant to be removed from Aryan Society not give any
use and even made honorary Aryans like Eldians can be made honorary Marleyans by
becoming one of the nine Elite Titans conversely if Eldians living in Marley are
meant to be Jewish then what are parodiesian Eldians meant to be if Paradis was
meant to be an allegorical ghetto then how does that symbol function when we are
exposed to literal ghettos at the end of season 3 is Paradis a ghetto or is it
Israel you can make that argument but it also falls apart pretty quickly because
you don't have foreign Jews trying to come kill Israelis it's either an
incredibly messy allegory or it's not an allegory at all the problem with any
reading of *Attack on Titan* is allegory itself there's no clear one-to-one
comparison any comparison that can be drawn has counter evidence but just
because there isn't any clear messaging through allegory symbolism nor illusion
does that mean there is no messaging at all as it happens there is an
alternative to allegory and that is the much less commonly employed
applicability which is the driving force behind none other than the Lord of the
Rings author J.R.R Tolkien developed the Lord of the Rings as a substitution for
the English mythology that was erased during the Norman occupation of Great
Britain in 1066. during this period through the 11th century Invaders from what
is modern day friends brought an end to what was the Anglo-Saxon era of England
come to think of it even this could be read as an allegory for *Attack on Titan*
an island nation dominated by a foreign Continental power that shook off its
oppressors to then go on and conquer the entire world so maybe Eren is actually
King George III anyway this period of British history was marked by a cultural
adjustment away from the local Germanic and Pagan roots of the Island's
post-roman Independence this included not only the introduction of Latin and
Greek grammatical conventions into a Germanic language system if you ever
wondered why English has so many silent letters this is why but the complete
Erasure of English mythological cycles pre-norm and English Heroes of myth would
have resembled a cross between the Germanic likes of Siegfried and the Celtic
likes of kukalan Beowulf was one of these figures but is believed to be a later
Edition and far from the only one instead the Normans replace that with French
derivative Heroes like King Arthur Tolkien was not at all a fan of this and his
creation of Middle Earth was developed over a lifetime of researching scraps of
surviving documents relics and anthropological discoveries the objective was to
create the closest approximation to a mythological cycle that would not have
felt out of place among the Anglo-Saxons famously Tolkien loathed the concept of
allegory I can imagine he felt it was a cheap way to beat direct moral messages
into the readers cordially dislike allegory and all its manifestations and
always have done so since I grew old and worry enough to detect its presence I
much prefer history true or famed with its varied applicability to the thought s
readers I think that many confuse applicability with with allegory but the one
resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of
the author and compared to his contemporaries he wasn't altogether wrong C.S
Lewis a good friend of his by contrast was going to personally come to your
house and beat your parents with a cricket bat if you didn't understand that the
lion is literally Jesus allegory is closed off this fake thing is this real
thing in the case of allegory there is an intended meaning and there are wrong
interpretations furthermore if allegory is referencing something specific then
there is a point at which this media loses its relevance or when people start
interpreting it the wrong way look at the Book of Revelations which is not
prophesying the end of the world it's prophesying the fall of the Roman Empire
which was currently taking place upon its writing suffice to say if a myth does
not speak to the ongoing culture of a Nation then it is not a myth that will be
remembered because the nation cannot continue using it for a sense of ongoing
cultural identity and tolkien's going to roll over in his grave when I say this
but there are allegorical parallels between Middle Earth and the United Kingdom
of the early 20th century first of all it's shaped like whales for starters
there's also strong overtones of axis themed villains and allusions to
environmental destroying industrialization of the blackened land in the
Southeast Tolkien existed within the culture of the day so it's nearly
impossible for him to not draw inspiration from Real World events aware or not
however these are details that aren't crucial to the plot but the symbols the
plot does revolve around were intendedly Universal and intendedly vague the most
famous among them is the One Ring itself many felt that it was an allegory for
the nuclear bomb which frustrated Tolkien to no end others felt it could be
wealth influence drugs politics power or even the temptation of power it's all
of these things and none of them what the ring represents is something much
closer to a human Universal the ring represents something that is Coveted and
coveted for different reasons it can't be a bomb or a weapon because it does not
give total power to all those who use it it can't be wealth because it has no
utility it can't be power because its users are not invulnerable it can't be a
drug because drugs don't make you functionally immortal talking about what the
One Ring could be is a video all on its own but it's a symbol that speaks to the
cyclical corrupting elements that reside in all people that not one person is
invulnerable to the Ring's call whether they have the ability to use it or not
applicability helps the Lord of the Rings function as a retroactive mythology
because the pivotal symbols can be reapplied to as many circumstances as needed
there will always be an analogy for the One Ring because there is always
something that will corrupt even the best of us even if the thing changes over
time and from culture to culture but is this what's going on in *Attack on Titan*
and if it is what is being made applicable there are direct allegories to real
world events such as the ghettos and the armbands but are these meant to be
symbols that draw the audience's attention to whatever the applicability is bear
in mind that the running of internment camps was not limited to Germans and here
in North America both Canadian and American internal security push Japanese
people into camps just like these are the allusions to Jewish ghettos meant to
implore the audience to observe this kind of ethnic persecution rather than
being a specific reference to the Holocaust and instead the aldians can possibly
represent persecuted people of all types rather than specifically European Jews
and especially when you begin to broaden the definition of internment camps in
the imagery of ghettos to a broader sense of ethnic isolation this theme could
also include native internment during colonial periods and later reservations
and residential schools but there is a great deal of debate in literary
criticism if characters in fiction can function as symbols at all after all the
more a character needs to function as a symbol the less agency they appear to
have can a fictional ethnic group appropriately function as a symbol especially
provided that the ethnic group in question actually does the thing that their
persecutors use to justify their institutional discrimination one of them does
try to use the power of the Titans to destroy the world other applicable symbols
such as totalitarian rule militarization despotism sacrifice propaganda humanity
and consumption again are moralized contextually these are Concepts and themes
not necessarily symbols but applicable nevertheless hell the imagery of fascism
itself falls under applicability when we think of soldiers Goose stepping down a
street our brains immediately go to the German fascists but look at the Soviets
the Chinese the North Koreans these countries adopted the look and pomp of Nazi
fascism for their own brand because it worked but those are all examples of bad
things problem with applicability and *Attack on Titan* is that these applicable
concepts are good and or bad depending on the circumstance applicability
functions so well in The Lord of the Rings because the moralization around the
applied symbol is universal the ring is always bad and those who intend to use
it for good either become bad or have a very selfish definition of what good is
if you use ultimate power to bring about world peace you still have a lot of
ultimate power left over just lying around those that want the Ring's power
cannot be trusted with it and those who do not want the Ring's power aren't
immune to it either one could argue that the same line of thinking can be
applied to the power of the Titans that even under the best intentions those
with the power of the nine universally Resort to evil and that Eren and Zeke
especially fall prey to the godly power of the founding Titan but Zeke and Eren
were flawed from the beginning and they had intentions for the power of the
founder even before they had a plan to use it furthermore Eren had the power of
the founding Titan for almost the entire duration of the series and yet his
personality made no shift from before and after he received it even his ability
to transform into the attack Titan did not corrupt him and he used both the
attack Titan and the founding Titan to help the civilians and soldiers of
parodies survived the Titan Onslaught applicability in *Attack on Titan* loses a
lot of the Finesse in nuances meant to drive drama in the plot even once held
truths of Titan's bad is turned on its head when the Gallant Heroes learned that
Titans are or once were humans which does fit into a rhetoric around
militarization practices where soldiers are conditioned to see the enemy as
sub-human between seasons 1 2 and the first half of season 3 Titans themselves
function as an incredibly applicable symbol for instance I first read the Titans
as a symbol for capitalist hoarding you have a collection of large people in
differently consuming everything without discrimination it's not a stretch to
see this as a criticism for a handful of aged capitalists hoarding an abundance
of wealth and making life miserable for everybody else the small people do their
best to resist but most will be consumed regardless especially since this media
was developed by someone who lived through the Japanese depression of the 1990s
there is contextual evidence to support this but there are other readings of
them such as the aforementioned dehumanized militant enemy but they could also
refer to the process of gentrification as they seek to push locals out of their
communities or even the military powers of Asia such as China that bear down on
the relatively militarily weak Japan so they could mean anything you want them
to mean even if we can dig through the source material to find scraps of meaning
that point one way or the other is there any way to actually discern what
intended meaning if any there was take the aforementioned quote from Hajime
Isayama being a writer I believe it is impolite to instruct your readers the way
of how to read your story ice I spend a lot of time following movie creators

interviewers will inquire as to what possible interpretations were intended
filmmakers especially get a particular kind of question is your Blockbuster
movie about X the answer almost always runs along the lines of being reluctant
to tell Their audience how to watch their movie in some instances yes there is a
deliberate social commentary scream highlights the facade of suburban safety and
comfort alien speaks to the threat of venereal infection in a society that had
abandoned condoms for the pill but a lot of the time filmmakers just want to
make a fun movie it's inevitable as mentioned for real world events to inspire
plot beats but that doesn't mean that social commentary is what the movie is for
believe it or not but most entertainers just want to entertain that isn't to say
they aren't methodical insightful or elegant people it just means that sometimes
they just want to push the boundaries of how many ways they can use artificial
blood provided that isayama offered a similar answer about art being in the eye
of the beholder maybe all the tragedy and militarism and *Attack on Titan* is just
meant for spectacle maybe all the imagery is meant to have no deeper
significance than to set the stage for a world that only really seems to
function because of war and to allow the audience to understand how these
characters interact with trauma the way they do maybe there is no statement
about the nature of military regime Doctrine and the manifestations of Martial
law maybe it's just about a bunch of sad people who don't know anything but War
because that's what they grew up in that doesn't mean *Attack on Titan* has no
value with or without fascistic messaging there are plenty of reasons to like it
and there are plenty of reasons to dislike it personal taste is enough of a
justification media needs to neither be grand nor demonic to facilitate an
opinion you don't need to dig into the subtext to either hail it as genius or
the root of all evil being entertaining is enough and I feel that the divisive
nature of this anime results from people having a conflict over messaging that
may or may not even be there to justify that their interpretation is the correct
one and that if everyone else could just see like they do it would either be the
Masterpiece or Pariah that it ought to be arguing that it's the greatest piece
of art ever created or the most destructive or two extremes that refuse to see
the Shades of Gray in between *Attack on Titan* is good because I say so attack on
Titan is dangerous because I say so all Eldians are evil because I say so all
Marleyans are evil because I say so we don't live in a black and white world of
perfection and inferiority where nothing is okay where things can only be great
or horrible in this world good and evil rarely exist as absolutes a world of
absolutes can't really exist the only truly absolute thing is death itself which
a component of fascist ideology is this Cult of death that how one dies is more
significant than how one lives perhaps all these characters are meant to be
cautionary tales so many of them let single-minded Devotion to the greater good
lead them to their deaths and in that process did they ever truly live were they
ever truly free death as an absolute shouldn't lock us into fatalistic paths but
should allow us to realize what freedoms we do have while we are alive if death
is the absolute then all other things exist as nuances in Shades of Gray
ascribing absolute values of good or evil is to reject the range of experience
that life has to offer the more we cling to absolutes in anything in life the
more we can sign ourselves to a path with no way to turn around or change course
that's what Eren did he decided that the greater good was worth trapping
himself on a doomed road that would only end in his premature death that's what
hatred does to people hatred traps you hatred removes your options hatred takes
away your freedom and it tricks you into thinking those you hate are the ones
who have taken your freedom away and like the characters in *Attack on Titan* we
exist in a world so full of hatred that it's hard not to get mired in it
sometimes it's our job to reject hate and those who propagate it not to hate
them in return but to pity them they've let their intolerance control their
lives don't let it control yours fly free and when the fascists and bigots and
hate mongers of the world try to demonize you know that it's because they see
your freedom they see you being yourself not trapped inside a cage and they hate
that you can be free and they can't you have strength they can't even imagine
and it horrifies them because there is nothing more horrifying to a fascist than
someone they hate who refuses to die [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
