<mark>In the early years of the twentieth century, life was extremely difficult for gay men and women.</mark> <mark>In cities that now celebrate gay pride, homosexuals<sup>(1)</sup> were actively persecuted.

The Pink Triangle: The War Against Homosexuals

Chapter 1: Before the Storm 

The Nazi war against Germany's homosexuals, to be properly understood, must be seen against the backdrop of the terrible tensions and social traumas that ultimately were to cause the collapse of the Weimar Republic. <mark>For the severe economic depression, widespread unemployment, galloping inflation, and bitter civil strife that were to engulf Germany in the wake of World War I</mark> also consigned the country's small but vigorous homosexual-rights movement to oblivion. That movement, which began around the turn of the century, would reach its peak in the early 1920s, under the remarkable leadership of Dr Magnus Hirschfeld. It would enjoy its greatest influence at precisely the moment that the larger society whose prejudices it sought to change began to spin out of control. To understand the fate of Germany’s homosexuals it is necessary to grasp not only the specific events and warring ideologies that destroyed the Weimar Republic and created the conditions that permitted the rise of the Nazis, but also the general atmosphere of Germany between 1919 and 1933.

<mark>A tidal wave of shame and resentment, experienced even by younger men who had not seen military service, swept the nation.</mark> Many people tried to digest the bitter defeat by searching furiously for scapegoats. <mark>The belief that internal enemies had brought down the Empire, the Kaiser, and the "Golden Age of German Power" was widespread.</mark> <mark>Enraged ex-soldiers and younger men formed violent bands that roamed Germany.</mark> <mark>A palpable yearning could be felt on all levels of society, from farm and factory workers to middle-class businessmen and big-city intellectuals, for security and vengeance.</mark> The old guard of the Empire had never given up their positions of privilege and power, and no truly democratic government ever really grow strong enough to dislodge them. Arch-conservatives still held most of the leading positions in the army and navy, the universities, the civil service, and especially the courts. <mark>Long before Adolf Hitler entered politics,</mark> long before antisemitism and anti-liberalism had become battle cries for the Nazis, <mark>the Weimar Republic's experiment in democracy and social tolerance was steadily undermined by distrust, injustice, and violence.</mark> <mark>One is almost tempted to say that Hitler did not bring the Republic down; he merely saved it from suicide by murdering it himself.</mark> It was bankrupt long before he appointed himself as Germany's savior.

<mark>A third factor cracked open the thin walls of stability and did more than any other to destroy trust and hope: the mammoth inflation of 1922-23. In just sixteen months the German mark soared from 192 marks to the American dollar to a staggering 4.2 *trillion*</mark> marks to the dollar.<sup>2</sup> <mark>The financial faith of the country was shattered beyond repair.</mark> The middle class lost its savings and its confidence in government. Persons on fixed incomes, such as pensions, war bonds, and annuities, found their dreams drowned in monetary quicksand. An incomprehensible economic sickness infected everyone, diminishing all salaries and gobbling up savings. Everywhere, pawnshops were packed, and relief rolls lengthened. The labour unions, too, in which many had put their trust, failed. Since the unions’ funds were gone, they could no longer resist the demands of employers: the ten-hour day returned to many industries. Unions began to lose members. Death and suicide rates rose; many children suffered from malnutrition. Those who had left the unions - and there were hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of them - found themselves politically adrift. Neither the left-wing Social Democratic Party (to which most labour unions belonged) nor the liberal or right wing parties offered any prescriptions to cure this epidemic.

<mark>The deepening crisis was compounded by a fourth factor: a rapid rise in unemployment, especially following the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, which killed half of central Europe's financial institutions.</mark> <mark>The number of unemployed workers increased from 1.5 million to 3.2 million. The actual number is estimated by some economists to have been more than 6 million.</mark>

Chapter One paragraph 9

<mark>A fourth factor compounded the deepening crisis was the rapid rise in unemployment, especially after 1929 New York Stock Exchange crash, which toppled half of the financial institutions in central Europe.</mark> Austrian banks collapsed first, then a number of leading German banks. In January 1930, <mark>the number of unemployed workers rose from 1.5 million to 3.2 million. Some economists estimate the actual number to have been more than six million by 1933.</mark> Many of the unemployed were teenagers or in their early twenties; they waited in endless lines before the welfare agencies to receive their meagre welfare stamps worth less than twenty dollars a month. On every corner, peddlers offered trinkets nobody wanted; street singers and itinerant musicians played endlessly in courtyards for people who could not afford to drop a few into their empty caps. Many young men, without hope, sullen and bewildered, were filled with a rage that knew no release. Many began to join the extremist parties of both the left and the right; many joined first the left, then the right. The promise of dramatic change suddenly made sense. Men were hungry too long, and now they were angry and desperate.

Chapter One paragraph 10

<mark>Into this social cauldron was added the fifth and most poisonous ingredient: the Nazi Party. As the number of unemployed rose, the Nazi membership rolls grew.</mark> To be sure, just before Franz von Papen maneuvered Hitler into the chancellorship in 1933, the Nazis had lost quite a few members. Still, the rise in unemployment and the growing strength of the Nazis were indissolubly linked. <mark>The Nazi Party not only provided food, weapons, and a splendid uniform, it proclaimed a new purpose, a new faith, and a new prophet. Inflation and unemployment catapulted into power a man who promised rebirth to all "Aryan" Germans, regardless of status.</mark> Hitler vowed to avenge the injustices of the Treaty of Versailles, and to punish the culprits who had been responsible for Germany’s defeat. As was so often the case, Hitler’s rhetoric was littered with sexual metaphors. Jews and other minorities, for example, were guilty of the “syphilitization of our people.” In 1935, Nazi lawyer Hans Frank would warn that the “epidemic of homosexuality” was threatening the new Reich. America, too, was an enemy, a “niggerized Jewish country” where women painted their faces- a practice that enraged Nazi moralists. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, would later boast that no Aryan woman he knew ever used lipstick. It was Himmler who would mastermind the attacks on homosexuals, whom he endowed with the same subhuman, dangerous qualities as were ascribed to Jews, Communists and Gypsies.

<mark>As the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. Göring instructed police stations to burn "all documents concerning the action of the past two days."[52] Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Röhm and Schleicher from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil.[46] Then, on July 13, 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:</mark>

"If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this. <mark>In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people.</mark> I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason, and I further gave the order to cauterise down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life. Let the nation know that its existence—which depends on its internal order and security—cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot."[53][54]

Himmler was obsessed, all right, but it was another type of compulsion- less visible than Hitler’s, more like that of a reclusive miser constantly counting his hoard of gold. This bureaucratic side, however, was not how most of the world saw him. <mark>The world perceived Himmler as the butcher who ordered all Russian prisoners of war to be killed, and as the man who organised the destruction of European Jewry. It was Himmler’s SS that set up and ran the concentration camps, beginning modestly in 1933 with a few criminals, Communists, Catholics, liberals, Socialists, Jews, and homosexuals in Dachau, and that, within ten years, had extended its network of terror over more than half of Europe. It was Himmler’s “Order of the Death’s Head” that supervised the gassing of inmates and the salvaging of the gold fillings in their teeth to be deposited at the federal bank in Berlin</mark> in an account credited to the fictitious “Max Heilinger."

Chapter Four: Persecution

WHEN, ON JANUARY 30, 1933, HITLLER was appointed chancellor, triumphant Nazi troopers staged a massive demonstration, marching with torches through the streets of Berlin, singing songs of vengeance. Still, Hitler did not have the majority of voters needed to win an election on March 5. Whether the Nazis really expected a Communist uprising or whether, as often before, they camouflaged their own wrecking methods by ascribing them to their opponents, luck came to their assistance. On February 27 the Reichstag, Germany’s white-columned, neoclassical parliament building, went up in flames. In no time, Hitler, Goring, and Goebbels turned up among the scorched ruins. Hitler proclaimed: “This is a sign of Providence from above. Now nobody will dare stand in our way when we crush the Communist menace with an iron fist.” Immediately afterward, a wave of terror swept throughout Germany, the first of many. Members of opposition parties found themselves on benches in the Berlin central police station. Similar arrests engulfed cities and villages throughout Germany. The Nazis had started to settle accounts with their enemies. When the jails proved not to be large enough, Himmler stepped in; within less than a month he embarked on the construction of concentration camps, beginning with Dachau.

Among the first to be jailed were the directors of homosexual rights organisations, which had been proscribed just four days before the burning of the Reichstag. Hirschfeld’s Institute for Sexual Research was a prime target, as were Kurt Hiller, its chairman, Felix Halle, a legal adviser, and Max Hodann, a respected sex reformer whose books on women’s rights, sexual minorities, and abortion had annoyed the Nazis for years. Hiller, Hirschfeld’s successor and the most prominent member of the institute, was shipped to Oranienburg, where he was repeatedly tortured. Through sheer luck he was discharged and later published a vivid account of his experience. The offices of several prominent homosexual organisations were raided during these early winter weeks of 1933. Storm troopers plundered the premises of Friedich Radzuweit, editor of Die Freundschaft (“Friendship”), and took his stepson to jail. Communist and Social Democratic papers were forced to stop printing. The Nazi propagandists never tired of conjuring up the smouldering debris, the smoking woodpiles, the devastated ceilings of the Reichstag, to declare that this fire was only a beginning. The Communists, they said, had destroyed the Parliament; now they would unleash a civil war. German citizens could expect the worst. Only the strongest government measures could save the nation. The strongest measures followed soon. On March 24, the so-called Enabling Law was adopted, subtitled the Law to Remove the Stress from People and State. In reality, it did away with the constitution, removed all legal restraints, and gave total control to Hitler and his thugs. It signalled the end of the Weimar Republic and the start of totalitarianism, and it remained on the books until 1945.

The blaze that consumed the Reichstag, the later ransacking of Hirschfeld’s institute, and finally the notorious book-burning of May 10, during which fanatical storm troopers destroyed the works of those who had made German culture great but were now declared to be subhumans, should have been seen as a signal to every non-Nazi that an era had abruptly come to an end, that a new dark age would follow. Shortly thereafter- and nearly a year before the Roehm purge- the Law for the Protection of Hereditary Health was enacted, a barely noticed omen of mass killings to come. Here terms such as “racially inferior offspring,” “deviant psychopath,” “criminally insane person,” and “unneeded consumers” were first introduced. Homosexuals should especially have been on their guard; as early as the fall of 1933, some were sent to Dachau and to Fuhlsbuttel, near Hamburg. Yet most gays hoped they could weather the storm. Many rushed to join the Nazi Party in the belief that they could vanish among the uniformed crowds; others hoped for the best, and although bars, cafes, and dancing places catering to homosexuals were eliminated, they tried to continue their lives as unobtrusively as possible. Gradually, many realised that their existence was threatened, and they lived in constant fear of discovery. Others joined the armed forces, over which the Gestapo was never to gain complete jurisdiction. But not until Roehm and his confederates were executed did most homosexuals believe that a country like Germany could fall back into barbarism. Now, however, there could be no mistaking the murderous intentions of the Nazis. There could be no doubt any longer that the Nazis were as violently opposed to sexual deviants as they were to such racial deviants as Jews and Gypsies.

<mark>Barely two weeks later, on October 26, the Federal Security Department for Combating Abortion and
Homosexuality was established in the Berlin Gestapo headquarters. It was headed by SS Captain
Joseph Meisinger, an ex-policeman from Bavaria who previously had been occupied with the
distribution of confiscated Jewish properties.</mark> His zeal pleased Himmler at first, but later the SS chief
had to acknowledge that Meisinger’s intellectual equipment was insufficient. When, in 1938,
Meisinger mismanaged the von Fritsch affair, he was transferred to Poland. There, as Gestapo
supervisor, he started a reign of such brutality that even his fascist co-workers denounced him. He
disappeared into Japan but was surrendered by U.S. authorities to Poland, where a Polish court had
him executed in March 1947 in Warsaw.

The all-encompassing control of the Nazi police directorates can only be appreciated by grasping the essence of the new jurisprudence. <mark>By 1936 the traditional, more conservative police agencies were
“federalised,” which meant that Himmler ruled virtually unchallenged. From 1935 and 1936 on,
higher legal officers were appointed by Wilhelm Frick, the Minister of Interior. Prosecutors were
granted more leeway, while defence lawyers and judges lost power. The rules of factual evidence
were abolished. Sentencing depended not only on the severity of the alleged criminal act but on the
“psychological type” to which the offender supposedly belonged. Thus, people accused of sexual
deviance had little chance of avoiding conviction by a Nazi court.</mark>

Two centuries before, King Frederick II of Prussia had abolished torture as a legal instrument for
extracting confessions or the names of accomplices. Now, in every large city, people were legally
tortured and executed in the cellars of Gestapo buildings. No one arrested on charges of real or
trumped-up homosexual activity could count on a fair trial. If, before 1933, homosexuals had been
second-class citizens, now they were slowly expatriated like the gypsies, denaturalised like the Jews.
They could be doubly scapegoated, as “incurably sick” and therefore candidates for mercy death, or
as “congenitally criminal deviants,” to be re-educated in camps. <mark>In December 1934 the Ministry of
Justice issued new guidelines stating that homosexual offenses did not have actually to be
committed to be punishable; intent was what mattered.</mark> This emphasis on intent originally had been
brought to bear in various cases of Jewish men accused of having had sexual relations with non-
Jewish women. Since both groups were regarded as contagious subhumans, similar strategies could
be employed against them. There were, however, significant differences in their treatment, as we

racial heritage was based. Criminal law must see to it that the folk community remained pure.
Fortunately, he claimed, it was alien to the German woman to indulge in lesbian activities. On the
contrary, most German women showed nothing but contempt for it. Klare admitted there were
problems. Lesbians, unlike some homosexual men, had not developed theories exalting a special,
same-sex society; they had produced no Hans Bluher. Moreover, women could be tender with other
women without arousing undue suspicion, and it would be difficult to discover, much less prosecute,
lesbian acts that were carried out in private. Klare therefore regretfully accepted the fact that, for
the moment, sexual contacts between women would have to go unpunished, but he hoped this
would prove only temporary.

Nazi jurists ignored Klare’s pleas, and Himmler seems never to have made any statements about
lesbians. Nevertheless, some –albeit very few- German lesbians were caught in the machinery of the
secret police. Little was known of their fate until quite recently. In 1975, Ina Kukuc published an
account of how some SS officers had arrested and sentenced lesbians. The one victim on whom she
reports most extensively was brought to court on a charge of treason- which was almost certainly
false. Helene G. from Schleswig-Holstein had been working for the counterintelligence division of the
Luftwaffe and sharing her residence with another woman, a lesbian. Toward the end of 1944, a
young lieutenant wanted to bed Helene’s girlfriend and, when rebuffed, took his revenge. The two
women were denounced and arrested. Helene, indicted for military subversion, was expelled from
the air force and sent to Camp Butzow. This violated regulations because Butzow was specially
designated as a penal camp for recalcitrant prisoners of war. It did not matter. She and five lesbians
were thrown into an empty cell block, under the command of male constables. “These are the scum
of the earth,” the guards are reported to have told the French and Russian POWs. “We wouldn’t fuck
them with a sofa leg.” The prisoners were promised a rare reward: for each woman they penetrated,
they would be given a bottle of schnapps. This grotesque sport was, of course, a violation of
Himmler’s orders concerning the purity of the German race. POWs were to be severely punished for
having had, or having tried to have, intercourse with German women. But then, the entire case, like
so many others, had no legal foundation and serves only to emphasise the extent to which the SS
felt itself to be free of all moral and ethical restraint. In the end, the only law that was respected was
the law of the jungle.

Another group that emerged untouched were some of Germany’s most prominent and open
homosexuals in the performing and decorative arts, who obtained the protection of high Nazi
officials. The most famous example is that of the actor Gustaf Grundgens, who was much admired by
Goring’s actress-wife, Emmy Sonneman. Despite the fact that his homosexual affairs were as
notorious as those of Roehm’s, Goring appointed him director of the State Theatre, and Grundgens
quickly became head of theatrical life in the Third Reich. In 1936, Klaus Mann wrote the novel
Mephisto, a bitter satire of Grudgens who had been married to Mann’s sister, Erika. He wrote the
book to “analyse the abject type of treacherous intellectual who prostitutes his talent for the sake of
some tawdry fame and transitory wealth.”

On October 29, 1937, in what appears to have been a concession to Goring’s rule over the arts,

to a camp/ then, on September 27, 1939, the Office for Combating Abortion and Homosexuality was
reorganised within the Federal Security Bureau to free up more agents for the headhunts.

On July 15, 1940, Himmler added an amendment to his April 1938 directive: men arrested for
homosexual activities who have seduced more than one partner must be transferred to a camp after
they have served their prison sentences. This was the usual fate for most people caught in the
Gestapo net, whether they had committed a burglary, embezzled money, or happened simply to be
contragenics: after prison they would be shipped to a camp. On September 4, 1941, the Ministry of
Justice published an extraordinarily vague ruling that anyone who threatened the health of the folk
community must be put to death.

On November 15, 1941, Himmler issued the Fuhrer’s Decree Relating to Purity in the SS and Police.
Henceforth any SS or police officer engaging in indecent behaviour with another man or allowing
himself to be abused by him for indecent purposes was to be condemned to death. That Himmler
had to promulgate such an order suggests that, despite his vigilance, homosexuality within the elite
SS had not entirely ceased; indeed, Himmler conceded at one point that he had to deal with one
case a month. In February 1942, the Fuhrer’s purity decree was extended to any male engaging in
homosexual activities. Finally, on May 19, 1943, after the Russians had retaken Stalingrad, after the
German forces in Africa had surrendered, Himmler advised the army and navy chiefs of staff that his
bureau held jurisdiction over soldiers and sailors convicted of same-sex indecencies. This seems to
have been the last ruling to make Germany homorein (homo-free). The absence of further decrees
should not be taken to mean that homosexuals were now left alone; the Gestapo kept arresting
suspects until the Russians had encircled Berlin.

How were homosexuals identified? The answer is- not easy. Unlike Jews and Gypsies, whose
religious or ethnic origins were routinely noted on their birth certificates, and unlike Communists,
Socialists, and Social Democrats, whose politics could be determined merely by a glance through
their parties’ membership rolls, gays were difficult to discover. No straightforward documents or
physical identification existed for homosexuals. The single exception was the central bureau of the
Berlin criminal police, which in 1897 had compiled lists of about twenty to thirty thousand
homosexuals throughout Germany.

The tradition of keeping track of as many potential undesirables as possible and the building up of a
huge documentation system gave Himmler a head start. To this aging list were added the names
obtained by the first large-scale arrests after the Roehm purge. Not only members of the SA, but
civilians caught in gay bars or clubs were seized, interrogated, their names noted. The Gestapo used
the same tactics it applied to all enemies of the state: pressure was put on victims to denounce
others. In 1934 the arresting officers still behaved somewhat guardedly; the courts had not been
beaten into total submission. Nor had the old Weimar police force been everywhere replaced by
Nazi fanatics. A well-connected homosexual could sometimes still find a lawyer to obtain release
from jail. However, after the revision of Paragraph 175, coercion was more openly used. Names of
friends and lovers were extracted under torture, and Himmler’s list grew longer. Bartenders not overly sympathetic to their gay clientele would occasionally provide names. One address book led to
another, one name to the next.

Fortunately, Hirschfeld’s Scientific-Humanitarian Committee had destroyed its membership rosters
in time. But it is not known if the larger organisation, the Friendship League, headed by Radzuweit,
managed to get rid of its archives early enough. Some 28,000 members paid regular yearly fees to
the League. Their names may well have landed on the desk of Captain Meisinger. Another means of
identifying suspected homosexuals lay in the confiscated subscription lists of about thirty magazines
of more or less homosexual orientation then available in larger cities. Although most of these were
probably purchased on newsstands, some may have been obtained by subscription. By 1938 and
1939, gay bars, clubs, and organisations had disappeared. Yet informers on all contragenics were
constantly being trained. The authorities encouraged every citizen to report on all who exhibited the
slightest evidence of deviance. Moreover, how was it possible for a suspect to prove that he had not
thrown an “offensive glance” at another man? In at least one instance, a man was arrested not
because he had been watching a young couple make love in a park, but because he had been seen
observing the actions of the man more than those of the woman. Julius Streicher, editor of Der
Sturmer, had urged his readers to write to him about Jewish men suspected of having, or trying to
establish, relations with non-Jewish women. Denunciatory letters poured in. The same pattern held
true for other contragenics. It was easy for anyone who wanted to get rid of a competitor to brand
the rival as a homosexual. With one short anonymous note to the local Gestapo branch, the enemy
of the state could be taken into protective custody or, at least, thoroughly interrogated. Later, after
the war had started in earnest, the authorities divided every city into administrative blocks. Each
block was supervised by a block warden, whose mission was to spy on everybody.

The book concedes that not all sexual activities between adolescents are proof of “true” or
“compulsive” homosexuality. Sometimes youngsters take to mutual masturbation out of sheer
curiosity. Still, it easily leads to “genuine perversion, and in the free-youth orders the leaders
occupied themselves mainly with the seduction of younger males. This led their victims, as they grew
older, to similar homosexual crimes. Thus, like an epidemic, these crimes spread further and
further.” It is clear that the book has borrowed from Bluher. The intellectual development of the
free youth sects led logically to homosexuality. It was supplemented by the idea that "'the Order is
destiny.' it meant everything to its brother-members, including the sexual sphere. Homosexuality
was part of the program. Even more, in various political and philosophical disguises it was accepted
as a basic ideological creed. Thus, the unnatural became the guiding principle."

According to statistics compiled by the Nazis and discovered after the war’s end, only 3,976 male
teenagers between fourteen and eighteen years old, of the more than 25,000 juveniles arrested for
crimes against Paragraph 175, were convicted between 1933 and 1940. Since the total of juveniles
during this period amounted to about 2.4 million, this number is relatively small. The legal
department of the Hitler Youth had researched the cases of 100,000 juveniles convicted of all sorts
of illegal deeds only to discover that on the average; just forty-seven out of ten thousand crimes
were of a homosexual nature. This was embarrassing; Schirach, like Himmler, was convinced that
homosexuals formed a greater portion of the criminal population. Still more embarrassing proved to
be a second inquiry into same-sex felonies committed between July 1939 and August 1941 within
the newly purged Hitler Youth. Of those ousted from the organisation, 293 were charged with
homosexual misdeeds- nearly 15 percent of the total expelled a rather large percentage.

These figures must be treated with caution. They indicate only the number of people arrested and
sentenced for homosexuality; they tell nothing of the truth of that charge. Further, they reflect only
the number of arrests and convictions the Nazis decided to record. It was not unusual for people to
disappear without a trace.

To understand what happened to those homosexuals in the armed forces who did not “pass” – that
is, those who were caught and convicted- three factors must be taken into account. First, after July
1935, as draft-age gays began to grasp the ferocity of the new anti-homosexual laws, many decided
to volunteer for the navy, army, or the air force. Neither General Keitel of the army, nor Admirals
Raeder or Doenitz of the navy, nor even Marshal Goring of the air force shared the homophobic
obsessions of Himmler. Second, after the Roehm purge had eliminated the homosexual SA elite, no
halfway intelligent gay was likely to join the homophobic SS. Third, none of the armed forces were
inclined favourably toward homosexuality. Statistics from 1940 show that the military courts were
busy with sexual offenders as more and more young men joined or were drafted. Simultaneously,
indictments of male civilians for the same felonies stayed the same or dropped slightly. In 1941,
about 3,700 civilians were sentenced for same-sex activities. During the same year, the number of
men indicted for the same crime within the armed forces amounted to just over 1,100.

The Pink Triangle p. 144

In 1942, Hitler declared that the armed forces were too lenient in their treatment of sexual deviants.
There was probably more behind this than Hitler’s pleasure in the badgering the military. Himmler,
who a year earlier had prescribed the death penalty for any SS member guilty of homosexual
actions, had probably pressured Hitler to the armed forces to conform. After all, an SS man caught
with a sailor could be executed, while the sailor might get away with one or two years in jail. A
psychiatrist, Otto Wuth, was appointed to alert military jurists to the dangers of all types of
homosexuality. Wuth, a firm believer in Himmler’s scriptures, disapproved of the distinction
between full-time libidinal felons and part-time victims. He labelled every male indulging in any type
of same-sex activities a “compulsive psychopath,” and sought to prove that most homosexuals had
previous criminal records of one sort or another. Should men convicted of homosexual felonies be
dismissed from the armed forces? Wuth thought not. He proposed to put them instead into penal
combat battalions where they had to face direct enemy fire. Wuth argued that if genuine
psychopaths were discharged from the fighting forces. Heterosexual malingerers might pretend to
be libidinal felons and use this ruse to get out of service. For repeat offenders, Wuth recommended
demotion in rank for minor violations, and strict prison sentences for major crimes; all criminals
were to wear a visible badge denoting their status.

“There are enough German oak trees to hang anybody who dares to deft us.” It was Eicke who
transformed Dachau from a disorderly open-air jail into a place of carefully calibrated punishment

Basically, Eicke worked out two sets of rules, one for camp personnel, one for inmates. Of the code

penal institutions- first those in the West, later in the extermination mills in the East. The earlier

These degradation rituals were applied to crush all novices. That, as some survivors have
maintained, the pink triangles were always larger than those of other colours, has not been proven.
Equally uncertain is whether there was ever any order to sequester homosexuals in special barracks
or to distribute them among the regular barracks population. In Dachau, Flossenburg, and
Sachsenhausen they were kept apart for a while. Rudolf Hoess, one of Eicke’s prize students, a
Dachau official, then commandant of Sachsenhausen and Auschwitz, explained in his memoirs that
he ordered homosexuals isolated to make it easier to control them. Hoess also developed the
“salvation through work” theory, which he tried out on homosexuals in Sachsenhausen and
Auschwitz. It was intended to make the depraved deviants work so hard that they nearly collapsed
from exhaustion. This, it was hoped, would “straighten them out.” Hoess admitted that it did not always work out this way, but he still kept them separated and assigned them to the cement works,
from which it was nearly impossible to emerge alive.

Hoess’s directives to keep the homosexuals strictly controlled, apart from all other prisoners, was
followed for a while in several camps. Of Flossenburg, one survivor writes: “Our block was occupied
by homosexuals, with about 250 men in each wing. We could sleep only in our nightshirts and had to
keep our hands outside the blankets.” This was to prevent them from masturbating. “The windows
had several layers of ice on them. Anyone found in bed with his under clothes on, or his hands under
the blankets- there were several checks every night- was taken outside and had several buckets of
water poured over him before being left standing in the cold for a good hour. Only a few people
survived this treatment. The least result was bronchitis, and it was rare for any homosexual taken
into the sick bay to come out alive.” In other institutions, the gays shared quarters with Gypsies,
asocials, or foreigners. Occasionally, homosexuals were distributed throughout various barracks and
were treated no worse than other prisoners.

What put the homosexuals into a low- if not the lowest- category of prisoner were several factors,
some easy to formulate, others more elusive. Hoess, for example, insisted on sequestering the gays.
Sealed off in their barracks, they could not fraternise with the antifascist underground, which, Hoess
knew, occupied key camp positions. Like Himmler, Hoess seems to have been convinced that most
homosexuals were intellectually above average, and thus they might serve as useful allies to the
dangerous antifascist power block within the camp. Hoess also believed that homosexuality was an
illness that might spread to other inmates or even to the guards. Himmler shared this conviction
and, to counter the danger, installed bordellos in many penal colonies. In Sachsenhausen and
Auschwitz, Hoess ordered homosexuals to visit the bordellos- perhaps thereby they would be cured
and become useful camp labourers.

There appears to have been an additional, deep-rooted folkloric dogma at work that doomed efforts
by gays to associate with one another or with their fellow sufferers. In his reminiscences, Hoess
observed that “even if they were in poor physical shape, they always had to indulge their vice.” It
wasn’t only Hoess and other SS rulers who presumed that homosexuals always had sex on their
minds and were forever bent on seducing heterosexuals. The inmates themselves also tended to
regard gays as men for whom nothing was more important than their genitalia. After all, that was
why they were jailed, that was what distinguished them from all other prisoners. In the camps, with
no women present, even the political prisoners worried that the situation offered the gays too many
opportunities to approach a sex-starved males. Such contact, in turn, was likely to lead to private
relationships, perhaps with Kapos or even guards, which might endanger the solidarity of the
antifascist coalition. Thus, when gay inmates tried to join a clandestine camp committee, they were
rejected. Both Nazi overseers and their prisoners took it for granted that the men with the Pink
triangles were somehow biologically programmed to seek nothing but sexual satisfaction.
Homophobia flourished everywhere, making it nearly impossible for gays to join any effort by
prisoners to improve conditions in the barracks. They were suspect as a class. Whatever assistance
they might offer was thought to mask a sexual motive.

There were additional factors complicating the lives of gay prisoners. First, a few SS guards were
homosexual. Although they risked everything, they made some younger inmates, usually Polish or

teenagers. They even drew lots to determine who should go to whom. Naturally, it enraged the
other inmates to watch as these youngsters received extra food rations and were exempted from
tough work assignments in exchange for sexual favours. There were also some SS guards who took
special pleasure in occasionally masturbating while torturing prisoners. For such acts, the gay
inmates were, so to speak, held accountable by the non-gay inmates: homosexual guards, however
hostile, were seen by non-gay prisoners as belonging to the homosexual underclass. Thus,

Cooperation among camp homosexuals was rare. Unlike the hard-core criminals, the antifascist, and
the Gypsies, the gays came from such widely disparate backgrounds that group solidarity was hard
to achieve. As Raimund Schnabel has observed in his study of Dachau: “Among the homosexuals
were exceptional people whose distance could be called tragic; on the other hand [there were] also
cheap hustlers and blackmailers. The prisoners with the pink triangle never lived long. They were
exterminated by the SS quickly and systematically.” Eugen Kogon, who survived six years in
Buchenwald as a political prisoner, went on to write the still classic account of the camp experience,
The Theory and Practice of Hell. Kogon gives more attention to the fate of contragenic minorities
than do most other writers. He confirms what Schnabel discovered about Dachau, that the light of
homosexuals was made especially terrible.

unscrupulous elements in positions of power to engage in extortion and maltreatment. Until the fall
of 1938 the homosexuals at Buchenwald were divided up among the barracks occupied by political
prisoners, where they led a rather inconspicuous life. In October 1938, they were transferred to the
penal company in a body and had to slave in the quarry. This consigned them to the lowest caste in
camp during the most difficult years. In shipments to extermination camps, such as Nordhausen,
Natzweiler, and Gross-Rosen, they furnished the highest proportionate share, for the camp had an
understandable tendency to slough off all elements considered least valuable or worthless. If
anything could save them at all, it was to enter into sordid relationships within the camp, but tis was

Perhaps the most feared assignments were to a detachment marked “Medical Experiments.” Kogon

the Danish endocrinologist Carl Vaernet with the German surgeon Gerhard Schiedlausky. These were
only a few of the many that took place there. I have singled out those by Vaernet because he used
homosexual inmates exclusively, and beause the sources in Arolsen were sufficient to draw
conclusions. The hormone tests, however, can stand as a model for virtually all of those tests carried
out by the Nazis on their human guinea pigs. These experiments brought illness and death to the
subjects and had no scientific value. Often, physicians and laboratory technicians did not know how
to proceed; files and samples were incomplete or misplaced; medicine could not be checked for
purity; and there was no control group. In the case at hand, Allied bombers repeatedly destroyed
containers carrying blood, urine, and other specimens in transit from Buchenwald to Vaernet’s

The epidemic was not a result of infection from outside sources, such as prisoners of war from the
East, as frequently happened in other institutions. The Buchenwald outbreak followed experiments
with the microorganism responsible for yellow fever, which had gotten out of hand. Although
Buchenwald seems to have provided better isolation wards than most camps, many prisoners –and
some guards- died. By then Vaernet had probably returned to Prague, but his name appears again in

After Liberation

Soviet Imprisonment

Most of the victims of the Holocaust were freed after the war was over. The Americans
and Soviets helped to free them and tried to restore Germany to order and safety. Prisoners tried
to find surviving family members and go back to their hometown. It was disorienting, after
being in the camps for so long and seeing all of the horrors, to go back to a world that did not yet
understand what happened. However, the homosexual prisoners were liberated from the camps,
only to face more discrimination. Since they were technically in the concentration camps
because of a "crime" that they committed, they were sometimes put into Soviet prisons after they
got out of the camps. Paragraph 175 had been on the books since 1871, and so the Supreme
Court ruled in 1957 that Paragraph 175 still stood since it was not a law made by the Nazis. As
noted, however, Paragraph 175 was strengthened by the Nazis and made into a more strict
version of the law. So homosexuals were more persecuted during the Nazi regime than ever
before, and in a much more brutal way than before or after the Holocaust, however the court did
not recognize this. Paragraph 175 was kept on the books in Germany until 1969, meaning
homosexuality was still thought of as a crime until that year. One man recalls that he was
repeatedly arrested under Paragraph 175 throughout the 1950s and '60S.<sup>87</sup> While other prisoners

Stigmatization of Survivors/Reparations
Homosexual survivors of the Holocaust often faced extreme discrimination once they
were liberated from the camps, even if they were not put into Soviet prisons. Survivors had to go
back to their towns, and find family and friends, many of now knew the reason that the survivor
was taken to the camps in the fust place. Survivors often had to lie about why they were in the
camps and keep quiet about their experiences. Prisoners who were in specifically homosexual
ban'acks, or had experiments done on them, often kept quiet because they didn't feel that they
could share their experiences for fear of ridicule or scorn. One man was in the concentration
camps for over eight years, and when he got out, he went right back to work in his family store.
He said he never told his mother anything that happened in the camps, he just kept everything
quiet and went to work. He didn't think that she would be able to hear everything that went on,
and didn't want her to have to deal with his "crime". He talked about "patiently carrying one's
burden" and feeling shame about his imprisonment because he was imprisoned as a
homosexual.<sup>88</sup> It was because of this shame that he never spoke to his mother about what had
happened to him for over eight years. So much of his life and torture had to be repressed and
kept a secret from everyone because he felt shame and was unsure how people would react. This
was a common theme between many of the homosexual survivors of the Holocaust. They were
shamed into silence. Their experience went unheard for many years because no one wanted to
hear it, and they felt ashamed to tell it. Prisoners often felt isolated by their neighbors who knew
that they were a homosexual and stayed away from them.<sup>89</sup> One prisoner recalls that after a
week or so, no one wanted to hear about his experience anymore. They were horrified by it and
could not comprehend what had happened, so they didn't want to talk about it anymore. The Nazis aimed to eradicate the homosexuals or "re-educate" them, and as Professor Lautmann of
the University ofBreman put it, the re-education towards heterosexuality was somewhat
achieved by the collective silence of the homosexual victims. <sup>90</sup>

In the 1990s, after the reunification of Germany, more LGBT rights groups and
homosexual survivors of the holocaust began demanding an official memorial for the
homosexual victims of the Holocaust. There were already many memorials for the other groups
persecuted by the Nazis however, the homosexuals were routinely left out. Other survivors were
not comfortable including the homosexuals in their memorials, and so they were left off of group
memorials, continuing decades of discrimination and hurt. Historians warn that when writing
about the Holocaust, people must be careful not to engage in, "a crass game of competitive
victimhood."<sup>94</sup> Everyone suffered horrible tortures in the concentration camp and it would not
be fair to say who suffered worse or deserves more compensations or memorials. Yet, the
homosexual victims did not start to be recognized until the 1990s, after they started to demand
they be heard.

Some memorials started off as "guerilla memorials" where gay rights groups would go
and place wreaths and other types of memorials at the concentration camps recognizing the
homosexual victims. One gay rights group actually got permission to put a memorial with a pink
triangle and the inscription "Beaten to Death-Silenced to Death" at Mauthausen concentration
camp.<sup>95</sup> This memorial not only speaks to the treatment of the homosexual victims within the
camps, but also the continued silence that happened afterwards. Other memorials to the
homosexual victims had started to be approved and these victims were fmally gaining some
recognition for their suffering. Some concentration camps started to put up memorial plaques at
the sites ofthe homosexual barracks, most notably one in Buchenwald concentration camp,
where many of the homosexual victims were sent. Other countries like the Netherlands, had
memorials put up much earlier than in Germany. In 2003, one of Germany's largest and most
well-known memorials to homosexual victims was approved, and was finished in 2008.

glimpse of a video containing two men (although this is sometimes rotated to show two women)
having to meet and share a secret kiss in the exact woods where the memorial is located. There
is very little that indicates this is a memorial to the homosexual Holocaust victims. A small
plaque and the video are the only clues. This was intentional, however, because Elmgreen and
Dragset wanted it to be like someone was just randomly happening upon this clandestine
relationship. They wanted to show the secrecy surrounding homosexual relationships and how
"a simple kiss could land you in trouble".<sup>96</sup> By being placed in the Tiergarten, and not well
labeled, the monument is a testament to the continued shame and secrecy that the homosexual
victims faced, even after the Holocaust. When visitors just happen across this memorial, they are
faced with watching a same-sex encounter and have to deal with their own feelings and potential
prejudices about the video displayed. In this way, the memorial is continually challenging
homophobia and honoring the continued victimization of homosexuals.

Conclusion

It has been estimated that over 50,000 men were arrested under Paragraph 175 during the
time of the Nazi regime. Of those men, it is estimated that around 15,000 were murdered.<sup>97</sup> Exact numbers cannot be known because the Nazis often kept poor records and burned many of
them when they knew their end was near. Many prisoners were quickly liquidated without
accurate documentation of their deaths. All of these men suffered under the Nazis and should be
remembered when discussing the Holocaust.

before the Nazis came to power Germany was experiencing more sexual Liberation than anywhere on Earth

to persecute more and more homosexuals and other men who they just believed to be gay they raided and

Before the Nazis came to power, Germany was experiencing more sexual liberation than
ever before, especially in Berlin. There were many gay clubs and organizations, starting to work
towards gay rights, specifically the repeal of Paragraph 175 which criminalized homosexuality.
These "Golden Twenties" were cut short by the Nazis, who strengthened Paragraph 175 and
stmied to persecute more and more homosexuals, and other men who they just believed to be
homosexuals. They raided and burned Magnus Herschfield's Institute of Sexual Research, and
assassinated Ernst Rohem, one of Hitler's closest confidants, who flaunted his homosexuality too
freely. Homosexuality, especially within the Nazi party itself, was seen as a threat to the
patriarchal behaviors of the party.

Homosexual men were thrown into separate barracks in the camps, and forced to do some
of the most excruciating labor, which often resulted in death. They were severely punished, and
were often seen as the lowest of the prisoners, even by the other prisoners. They often had
medical experiments done to them that affected them and shamed them even after they were
liberated, if the experiments didn't kill them fIrst. While lesbians weren't specifIcally
persecuted, many of them still ended up mthe camps and faced discrimination, even though their
treatment was not as brutal. This was because it was thought that they could just be forced into
carrying out the Nazis will of Aryan procreation.

after the Holocaust homosexual victims were shamed into silence the gay victims
of the Holocaust deserve respect and recognition their voices should be heard and their stories taught alongside the
other victims of Hitler's Purge if we continue to ignore or silence their voices we are letting the
Nazis win

Student paper p.37

After the Holocaust, homosexual victims were often shamed into silence about their
treatment in the camps. They faced renewed discrimination and potentially even imprisonment if
they said why they were in the camps. They did not feel comfortable pushing for reparations and
memorials until almost 50 years afterthey were liberated. Even today, they are still not well
recognized or compensated. Only recently have we been able to get some testimony from
homosexual survivors, many of whom did not want to be identified.
The homosexual victims of the Holocaust deserve respect and recognition for all of their
sufferings within the camps. Their voices should be heard and their stories should be taught
along with the other victims of the Holocaust. If we continue to ignore or silence their voices,
we are letting the Nazis win, and m;e contributing to the homosexual victim's shame and
victimization. It is impOliant to keep the memory of these victims alive, especially as we enter
into a time when many of our homosexual survivors are dying off, some of their stories never
heard.

in many ways the specters of the Third Reich still haunt
us the specters begin to come to life whenever Fanatics of any sect try to
take over a nation and call for a war against its most vulnerable and vilified
minorities since the end of World War II in the discovery of the Nazi death machine every Modern Nation across the
globe has spoken the same mantras it could never happen
here and never again Western Nations have decried
countries as backwards when they begin murdering giant portions of their own populations Jewish people Muslims racial
minorities and ethnic groups but when gay people are being arrested hung shot
drowned and decapitated in countries like Iran Saudi Arabia Somalia Chia Russia Syria
Uganda our political leaders our Representatives Fain offense but do
nothing about it they may threaten sanctions but no one will go to war to
save the gays and so we have to save ourselves we have to do what we can to
get gay men and women and trans people out of countries that would see them murdered by the state get them away from
vicious leaders who would rather see them riddled with bullets than holding
hands we must learn the lessons that were taught in Europe and then we must mean
it we must act when we say
never
again
