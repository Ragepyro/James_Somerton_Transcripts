/u/verilyb:
In "Video Games and the Choice to be Gay" James Somerton plagiarises a Techraptor article on queer video game history.

At 1:33 he says,

“Most of the time, queer characters were actually purposefully censored for the West, mostly removing bits of dialogue from NPCs in games such as Phantasy Star II or Streets of Rage 3. In the West, only adventure and computer games made direct references to queer characters, but they were often overtly stereotyped. The first speaking role for a gay character, for example, was the FMV game Dracula Unleashed, but the character, the co-owner of a bookstore named Alfred Horner, was portrayed as a pervert.”
Which is from here: Queer Characters in Gaming - A Brief History by Robert Grosso, TechRaptor.

The same video also extensively rips off our video "The Gay Button: How Bisexuality Changed Video Games" as detailed here. (We don't want any money for it, just to let it be known!)
