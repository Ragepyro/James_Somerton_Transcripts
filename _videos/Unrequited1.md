<wbr on />The queer community has become incredibly good at finding queer subtext in movies and TV shows, whether it exists or not. For over a century of film and television, we've probably been the most underrepresented minority in media. It was never illegal for a character of color to exist in a movie, but it *was* illegal, for a long time, for a queer character to exist. <wbr off /> Writers, directors, and producers could be taken to court under obscenity laws, fined and even jailed, for having the nerve to show a queer character. 

<wbr on />At the same time, it's become a culturally agreed upon fact among cis-straight people, to the point of parody, that the queer community runs Hollywood. The Velvet or Pink Mafia, supposedly now run by David Geffin, is even an assumed queer media cartel that inserts LGBT messaging into movies and TV shows to corrupt the youth of America. <wbr off />

The funny thing is, this isn't entirely false. I mean, we're not trying to corrupt the youth of America; growing up alone in the suburbs is doing a fine job of that all on its own.

<wbr on /> But there has always been a loose collective of queer creators that *do* insert coding into a lot of movies, TV shows, and books, coding that would likely be ignored by straight audiences but immediately recognized by those of us who are on the lookout. It's reached a bit of a fever pitch lately, with Po and Finn, Steve and Bucky, *Teen Wolf*, *The Legend of Kora*, and even *Frozen*. But just because people outside queer spaces are finally recognizing it doesn't mean it's a new thing. What we now call queer baiting has been around since the early days of cinema. Sort of.<wbr off /> Film historians have given the early days of this phenomenon the name "queer coding", which a lot of people confuse with "queer baiting", but there is a big difference between the two. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"Queer coding" is when you're unable to show actual queer characters on screen, either because of the laws or morals of the day, or because studio executives just won't let you. So you create characters that the right audience will *obviously* view as gay, lesbian, bi, or transgender, to allow for LGBT representation when the entire world is telling you not to. A little golden nugget hidden deep underground for the people who are willing to dig for it. 

<wbr on /> While "queer baiting" is when you *do* have the ability to add queer characters to your film or TV show, but just don't want to risk turning off certain audiences or advertisers by doing so. One is an effort to give LGBT audiences at least a taste of representation, while the other is used to reel in said audience with an implied promise of queer characters without ever actually intending on fulfilling that promise. <wbr off />

It's like the cinematic equivalent of edging without the money shot.

<wbr on />So let's look at the history of this practice, discover media you may not know is intended to be read as queer, see when the line between queer coding and queer baiting began to blur, and why we still don't have an out LGBT superhero in the MCU.

<wbr on />A long time ago, in a Hollywood Far Far Away, gay characters were not all that uncommon. But they were played for laughs. In the early days of silent film, movies like *A Florida Enchantment*, *Algae the Minor*, and *The Soilers* featured gay characters as easy comic relief. The idea of homosexuality was even a gag in *Behind the Screen*, an early Charlie Chaplain film that showed him kissing a tomboy and being mocked for it. Being mocked by someone whose eye makeup could make Trixie Mattel blush.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It was around this time that that the "sissy" stereotype was born: flouncy, bouncy, frilly men with creative jobs. Artists, designers... This grew out of the self-hatred among straight men who found it hard to provide for their families in lean times. You weren't a man if you couldn't support a wife and three kids. You weren't a man if you couldn't go off to war. So to appeal to the egos of these (quote-unquote) "real men", producers created characters to make them feel better about their masculinity. Movies like *Our Betters*, *The Broadway Melody*, *Meron Merge*, and *Call Her Savage* were just a few films with such characters.<wbr off />

This type of representation of gay men was not appreciated.

This wasn't the only representation though. <wbr on />The 1927 film *Wings* featured a...<wbr off /> a very intense friendship between two pilots that culminates in this scene:

But scenes like that were few and far between. So while gay men were played for laughs, lesbians were something else entirely. 

<wbr on />Marina Dietrich turned on both men and women with this scene in 1930s *Morocco*. A woman in a tuxedo wasn't entirely unheard of coming out of the Roaring 20s, but a woman in a tuxedo on film? That was groundbreaking. The lesbian kiss, a cherry on top. Gary Cooper may have been Dietrich's real love interest in the film, but everybody left the theater talking about that scene.

Not long after *Morocco*, we got *Queen Christina* the story of a realife Swedish Monarch who was infamous for being a,,, pretty out and proud lesbian for the day, though the filmmakers went out of their way to straightwash the historical figure, her real life sexuality bled onto the celluloid despite their best efforts.

Along with homosexuality, sex, violence, and orgies were pretty common in early Hollywood, oddly in biblical films. And some people we're getting fed up with it.<wbr off />

Starting in 1922, after the earliest of these morally questionable films had become massive successes, and a series of real life Hollywood scandals had rocked the papers, studio heads enlisted William H. Hayes, the former Postmaster General (so he was obviously qualified) to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. He was one of the few unindighted members of Warren G. Harding's administration at the time, so obviously his moral fortitude was robust.

<wbr on />In 1924, he ented introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "The Formula", which Studios were advised to strictly follow. Back in 1915, the Supreme Court case *Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio* had already decided that Free Speech laws didn't extend to Motion Pictures, stating that<wbr off /> "because film may be used for evil, we cannot regard censorship as beyond the power of the government". So the industry was on thin ice as it was. It could be a *disaster* for them to draw the ire of conservatives in government. Directors and writers, though, mostly ignored the suggestions.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In 1927, Hayes strongly suggested Studios form a committee to discuss film censorship. The heads of MGM and Fox complied and created a list of "don't"s and "be careful"s. This oddball list included things like:

\[Displayed on screen, read out word for word]:

> Pointed profanity -- by either title or lip -- this includes the words "God", "Lord", "Jesus", "Christ" (unless they be used reverently in connection with the proper religious ceremonies), "hell", "damn", "Gawd" and every other profane and vulgar expression however it may be spelled;

> Any licentious or suggestive nudity -- in fact or in silhouette, and any lecherous or licentious notice thereof by other characters in the picture;

> The illegal traffic of drugs;

> Any inference of sex perversion;

> White slavery 

(but not black slavery, that was fine!)

> Miscegenation [or] (sexual relationship between the races);

> Sex Hygiene and Venial Diseases

> Scenes of actual childbirth -- in fact or in silhouette; as long as it isn't shown on screen

> Children's sex organs

(okay this one actually, you know, makes sense)

> Ridicule of the clergy;

> willful offense to any nation, race or creed;

(I feel like not *all* races were included in that)

> Special care should also be taken when portraying the use of firearms, the American flag, men and women sharing a bed, and actual murder[s].

So it was relatively okay to show *actual murder*, but even the idea, *the inference*, of homosexuality was a big no-no.

Many writers and directors in Hollywood, many of them gay themselves were, not too happy with the implementation of the Hays Code. Especially since in places like Weimar Republic Germany, advancement of queer representation on film was becoming mainstream. At least until the rise of Adolf Hitler. They saw what little progress that was taking place in North American Cinema come to a screeching halt with the Hays Code introduction, and they decided to fight back against it any way they could. And the only way they could at the time was to create characters that were quite obviously gay to any queer person watching, but who could fly under the radar of the censors.

<wbr on />One way to get the censors to turn the other way was to code villains as gay. Such as the obsessive Mrs Danverse and Alfred Hitchcock's *Rebecca*. After the titular Rebecca dies, it is revealed to the audience that her housekeeper Mrs danverse has kept all of her clothes, with a special care given to her underwear.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Another example is 1941's *The Maltese Falcon*. In the film, Peter Lori plays Joel Cairo, one of the film's villains. In the book on which it's based, Cairo is stated very clearly to be gay, queer in fact, but in the movie it's instead inferred, with his business card being sprayed with perfume, a lilting feminine demeanor, and his propensity to orally fondle his cane.

<wbr off />This trend of coding villains as gay lasted for decades, a topic I covered more in depth in my [Monsters in the Closet video](4zPCM14-SCQ.md). <wbr on />Sometimes the censors would turn a blind eye to lesbians on the screen, but only under certain circumstance. The "lesbian prison movie" became almost a cliche in the 1940s and 50s, killing two birds with one stone: scaring girls into following the law lest they end up in prison with big scary lesbians, and convincing many young lesbians to go straight, since lesbians seem to have no fate *but* to end up in prison.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Lesbians in these movies tended to be played by large imposing women, and they likely had a position of authority within the prison. not guards or anything like that, God forbid, but the women who had been in prison the longest had relationships with the guards. and so the guards were more likely to turn a blind eye to their sapphic tendencies.

representation of queer women was more subtle in 1950s *Young Man With A Horn*, but just barely. Lauren Bacall plays Amy, an obviously bisexual character that becomes a chaotic force in the life of our main character, Rick. while observing Doris Day's Joe Jordan, Amy comments:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.celluoid_closet %}>

Amy: "It was interesting, isn't she? So simple and uncomplicated. Must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and know just which door you're going to walk through. But she's so terribly normal."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

She's referred to by other characters as having a twisted mind, and eventually Rick tells her that she's sick; this description falling into the prevailing medical opinion on homosexuality at the time.

An iconic example of queer coding that straddles the line of Hays Code approval is 1955's *Rebel Without a Cause*. Starring two teen heartthrobs, James Dean and Sal Mineo, both of whom are at least *rumored* to have been queer. Dean's character Jim is a teenager kicking against authority and parental neglect. Who becomes both friend and fascination to Mineo's Plato, a lonely younger kid. 

Plato is obviously gay, although it's easier to say that in 2020 than it was in 1955. If you don't pick up on that from the photo of hunky Alan Ladd that Plato has taped inside of his locker, or the looks of adoration he gives Jim, it becomes *abundantly* clear when he makes a coded declaration of love to Jim late in the film. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.rebel_without_cause %}>

Jim: "No? Not ready to come out yet?"

Plato: (verge of tears) "No."

Jim: "No? Okay. Promise you nothing will happen if you do."

Plato: (shaking head) "No."

Jim: "Are you cold? Here." (takes off jacket) "It's warm. Here. My jacket; it's warm."

Plato: (deer-in-the-headlights look) "Can I keep it?"

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Jim has feelings for Plato too, although the main narrative is him falling in love with Natalie Wood's character Judy. James Dean could read the subtext though. prior to filming the intense encounter with Mineo in the abandoned Getty Mansion, he told him, "look at me the way that *I* look at Natalie". 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Such homoerotic bonding couldn't be spoken about in the repressive 1950s. Being gay was still illegal in most of the country, and at minimum frowned upon everywhere else, and the censors of the day took pains to keep it that way. A production code officer sent a memo to Jack Warner in the spring of 1955 during the filming of *Rebel Without a Cause*, reminding the Warner Brothers executive that--<wbr off />

\[on screen, radio filter]:
> "it is of course vital that there be no inference of a questionable or homosexual relationship between Plato and Jim."

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.rebel_without_cause %}>

<wbr on />\[Plato and Jim close a garage door]

Plato: "Hey, you want to come home with me? I mean, there's nobody home at my house and, heck, I'm not tired. Are you?"

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>


Now *that's* some *subtle* inference. 😏

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<wbr on />Most straight reviewers of *Rebel* didn't pick up on anything beyond "Boy Meets Girl" and the romantic entanglements. the strongest impact the film makes is non-verbal, operating on an unconscious level. the mere sight of Dean and Mineo exhibiting unabashed love for each other sent a powerful message. Dean's Jim isn't afraid to show affection for Plato as well as Judy. as Brave as the filmmakers were to show a pretty blatant example of a gay, or at least questioningly gay, relationship on screen, they knew the strict morals of the day might take the picture down.

So Plato, the more obviously gay of the two characters, has to die in the end. He can't live happily ever after. He can't live at all. Can't give the impression that that kind of lifestyle could result in anything but pain and death. James Dean would die in a car accident before the film was even released. And... Sal Mineo would be stabbed to death in West Hollywood at the age of 37. <wbr off />

And now for an abrupt segue!
{% assign timecode = "16:27" %}

<wbr on />You wouldn't expect expect there to be queer coding in *Ben-Hur*, of all movies -- the book was subtitled "The Tale of the Christ" -- but there actually is. Gore Vidal, screenwriter of the film, said this in 1996:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.celluoid_closet %}>

Gore Vidal (being interviewed): "Let's say that these two guys, when they were 15-16 when they last saw each other, they had been lovers, and now they're meeting again, and the Roman wants to start it up. Messala, played by Steven Boyd, wants to started up again with Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston, heaven knows why, but he does. Anyway, he's Roman.

Vidal: "So, uh, Willie stared at me, face gray, and I said 'well, I'll never use the word, there'll be nothing overt, but it'll be perfectly clear that Messala is in love with Ben-Hur.'

Vidal: "Willie said 'Gore, this is Ben-Hur. A Tale of the Christ, I think is the subtitle,' he said rather vaguely looking around. And Willie finally said, 'Well, it's certainly better than what we've got. We'll try.'"

\[Playing clip from Ben-Hur, music swelling]

Messala: (laughing, clasping hands with Ben-Hur) "After all these years! Still close!"

Ben-Hur: "In every way." (chuckling)

Vidal (being interviewed): "He said, 'Have you talked to anybody about this?' and I said 'No.' He said, 'You talk to Boyd (Messala). Uh... don't say *anything* to Heston, because Chuck will fall apart. I'll take care of him.'" (laugh-snort) "So Heston he's doing 'Francis X Bushman'. In the silent version, his head is always constantly on high like this and like this." (demonstrating)

Vidal: "And Steven Boyd is acting it *to pieces*. There are looks that he gives him that are just *so clear*."

\[Playing clip from Ben-Hur]

Messala: (giving one of said looks) "I said I'd come back."

Ben-Hur: "I never thought you wouldn't."<wbr off />

And even more egregiously with another Tennessee Williams adaptation *Suddenly Last Summer*. <wbr on />Screenwriter Gore Vidal (...seemed to be writing a lot of these movies at the time) said the film was forced before the legion of decency and cut to bits until it made no sense at all. But the messaging, though now coded, was still there. That the unseen character of Sebastian used the women in his life to attract men he could sleep with, ending in his violent murder by a savage mob.

When the film was released, the New York Times ran a *scathing* review, telling potential movie goers "if you'd like incest, rape, sodomy, cannibalism, degeneracy, this *sickening* picture is the the one for you." <wbr off />*Inadvertently* they had given the film the best advertising campaign it could possibly hope for! Making it a *breakaway* success for stars Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<wbr on />Coding went out *the window* with 1961's *Victim*, giving filmgoers their first gay hero. And a sympathetic betrayal of homosexuals in general. The British film was attacked by censors in the UK and the US. with UK censors giving it an X rating and America's production code refusing to classify at all. Decades later, when it was eventually released on home video?<wbr off /> It was rated PG-13.

<wbr on />As the production code slowly began to fade away in America, with original restrictions like open-mouth kissing, nudity, profanity, abortion, and prostitution now finding their way through the censoring process, only one remained: the sex perversion clause.

<wbr off />No major studios and stars had yet tackled the subject of homosexuality in any meaningful way in Hollywood... But that would change with 1961's *The Children's Hour* <wbr on />starring Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The film was willing to show that, yes, homosexuality *is a thing*, it *does exist*, but it's not something good moral people should talk about. MacLaine and Hepburn play two friends, Martha and Karen, who opened a private school for girls. When one of their students, a vicious little bully, is punished by Karen by not allowing her to attend that weekend's boat race, the little wretch concocts a story about the two women being lesbians and tells her grandmother. This leads to a series of ever escalating circumstances, including a lawsuit, that leave the two women emotionally drained. And Karen's engagement (to a man) left in limbo. 

But even after the accusation has proven false, their lives are not the same. Karen's fiance leaves, so Karen wants to leave town for good start a new life somewhere else. A fevered back and forth leads to Martha realizing that she actually does *love* Karen, and not just as friends. She's *in* love with her best friend and feels *terrible* about it. She feels responsible for ruining their lives and is disgusted by her feelings for Karen. And so one day while Karen is out for a walk...<wbr off /> Martha hangs herself.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and is considered one of the best courtroom dramas ever made, but its Legacy is not quite so positive. The entire movie is about how horrible it would be for two nice young women to be lesbians, just the idea of it leads people to gasp, and end with one of them killing herself. Homosexuality was not really a part of the movie, it was only a negative plot device. How people are treated when accused of a crime so heinous. The lesbian experience isn't really expressed in the film at all, and even Shirley MacLaine has gone on record in 1996 saying William Wyler, the director, never even *spoke* to her about the lesbian elements.

But though the film's depiction of homosexuality and reactions to it are flawed, it still rings true to many. people still live in environments where they're called "sick" and "dirty" for being gay, either by those around them or by depictions of queer people in the media. So Martha's self-loathing is *all* too familiar to *many* people. After *The Children's Hour*, movies about queer self-loathing became more frequent.

It wasn't the end of gay coding, but gay stereotypes began to replace it. There would still be stereotypical gay portrayals across *every* genre of film: Butch lesbians, feminine men, and *sneaky* bisexual and transgender people.

But it wasn't all roses. TV networks faced advertiser boycotts and people picketed movie theater showing *Brokeback Mountain*. There was money to be made by appealing to the LGBT community, but it came with great risk. That risk was compounded by a string of queer inclusive bombs like *Running With Scissors*, under-performers like *Milk*, and gay backlash toward movies like *Bruno* and *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry*. 

The queer audience was a volatile one. One that wouldn't accept just any movie you gave them. And if you directly appealed to the queer audience, you ran the real risk of turning off the straights. So producers and writers needed to figure out a way to appeal to the gays without putting off the heteros. And they looked to a burgeoning internet fan community to find the answers.

The Harry Potter series of books and movies had birthed Harry / Draco slash fiction, on online forums, and was becoming a massive trend with stories and art spreading all over the internet. Although the characters have almost no positive interactions at all in the books or movies, let alone romantic ones, fans were drawing romantic conclusions from breadcrumbs that really didn't even exist. This is when creators realized that the queer community would do the work for you. They'd fill in the LGBT-shaped blanks and all you had to do was drop a few hints. And leave a few empty spaces. And straight audiences be none the wiser. 

And so, gay-bating was born.

## Part Two: Taking the Bait

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now here's where I lay out a little caveat for you. In doing my research for this, I found enough instances of gay baiting to fill a whole book, let alone a video. So I decided to break it down into eight instances that stood out amongst the rest. These got the most media attention and the most fanfiction and the most fan attention. 

I'm also not going to be covering any queer baiting that was eventually made canonical, like with *The Legend Of Korra* and *Adventure Time*. That's actually called queer catching, which is when a character's queerness is confirmed *after* a media franchise has finished and therefore you're not running the possibility of impacting its ratings or its sales. Or you reveal that a character is gay on a press tour for a movie but it's never really manifests in the movie itself. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The most infamous example of this would be a certain British author confirming that Dumbledore was gay after her book series had ended. But she doubled down by *actually* queerbaiting him in a future film installment. But we're not done talking about her and her Wizards. Oh no. Not yet.

An interesting trend in queer baiting is that slightly more loose rules apply to lesbian characters. When two female characters are queer they may actually end up coupling up in the end of the story. This is of course because according to market research (and I work in marketing so I know this), male and female audiences are both more okay with lesbian characters than gay characters. While straight male audiences are likely to turn off immediately when two male characters turn out to be gay. It's even shown that parents are more likely to be okay with their kids seeing a lesbian couple than a gay couple. The assumption, at least among media researchers, is that it's easy for heteronormative audiences to view lesbian couples asexually, since there's technically no penetrative sex. Unless you *actually* know a lesbian and know that sex toys exist.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But even then, lesbian characters are only likely to be confirmed to be queer at the end of the story if not afterwards in some other form of media, uh novels, comic books, stuff like that. Again, this happened with *The Legend Of Korra*, notoriously. It also *almost* happened very recently with the new incarnation of *She-Ra*, but they got that lesbian confirmation in *right* under the wire. And of course, that research doesn't cover everyone and there are plenty of people who find lesbians just as disgusting as gay men. 

The acceptance of lesbians in mainstream culture is just slightly more prevalent, mostly thanks to Ellen's brand of family safe gayness. *But* if anyone of you wants to share some videos or articles that cover lesbian queer baiting that I might have missed, please share them with me and I will link them in the description below. And I just want everyone to know... I tried to include *Supernatural*, I did, but try as I might I could not follow that show at all, it makes no sense!

So now that the caveats are out of the way...

### Merlin

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<wbr on />Merlin premiered on the BBC in September of 2008 and almost immediately became fodder for gay fan fiction. And it's no wonder why: Colin Moran's Merlin and Bradley James's Prince Arthur (he's not a king yet) have so much sexual tension between them you could cut it with a knife.

Merlin is set in ancient Albion, a mythical version of England, in a time prior to the Arthurian legends (mostly prior to the Arthurian legends). Merlin has become the apprentice of Gaius the king's potions master. Merlin, in case you didn't know, also has the ability to use magic, but he needs to keep it secret from everyone, because the King Arthur's father Uther is homophobic--<wbr off /> I-I mean he hates magic! <wbr on />Hates it so much, that he believes people ought to be executed if they have magical powers. Because it's simply not natural.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We soon meet his annoyingly arrogant son Arthur, and I mean... yeah I'd probably be annoyingly arrogant too, if I looked like that. When Merlin meets the prince, they don't quite get along. But, while at a royal function as Gaius's guest, Merlin ends up saving Arthur's life. To thank him for his bravery, King Uther bestows Merlin the *wondrous* honor of being Arthur's manservant. (I mean there could be *worse* jobs.)<wbr off />

Merlin, though, is not happy. But he decides to go along with it after meeting a dragon that informs him that Arthur is his destiny.

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.merlin %}>

Merlin: "How can it my destiny to protect someone who hates me?"

Dragon: "A half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole."

If you've read Plato Symposium, that whole two halves making a whole thing will mean a lot. Or if you're *not* a nerd and just understand romantic language tropes. As a quick aside, as TV dragons go, can you believe Game of Thrones came came out just 3 years after this?

So, how is it that these two characters who hate each other could become friends? Each other's destiny. Oh come on, you've seen a romantic comedy, you know how this works! <wbr on />By episode 4, they've grown *so* close, that when Merlin has been poisoned, Prince Arthur risks his life to save him by venturing into the cave of an evil *beast* in order to get a flower that acts as the antidote to the poison.<wbr off /> Arthur, who starts off as a pompous ass, is willing to risk his own life to save the life of his *servant*, one that could *easily* be replaced, maybe even by someone who *doesn't* need a limb so much.

<wbr on />By the end of the first season, they're both willing to drink poison to save the other's life.<wbr off /> But even after that, there's a *tension* between them, since Arthur is a prince and Merlin is just a lowly servant.

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.merlin %}>

Arthur: "All right, I know I'm a prince, so we can't be friends. But if I wasn't a prince--"

<wbr on />As the seasons go on, Merlin's feelings for Arthur become more prevalent. He becomes incredibly jealous when women show affection to Arthur. There's a running gag about him wanting to *hug* Arthur. And he's not shy about ripping Arthur's pants off.<wbr off /> 

But there's a bond between the two, one that Merlin can't *let* become too strong. He can't become too connected to Arthur because he's gay-- I mean, a wizard. He's gay *and* a wizard. <wbr on />And Arthur's own father would execute Merlin if he found out about him. In fact the show doesn't exactly *hide* that magic is a metaphor for homosexuality. It's on the level of obviousness of *X-Men 2*. Even in the language used, no one ever says they *practice* magic, they say that they *have* magic. It's something they're born with, something they have no say over, and yet they're persecuted for it anyway, because of the ignorance of the majority.

Woman: "What if... magic isn't something you choose? What if it chooses you?"

\[Merlin looks contemplative.]

Magic is Merlin's greatest weapon, though, and he uses it to save Arthur's life time and time again throughout the series. Merlin is so close to Arthur, so drawn to him, despite the servant-master divide between them, that he's willing to risk his *life*, not just to save Arthur's life but to even be *around* him. If he were to accidentally use magic in front of the wrong person, it would be the end of him. He even hides his magic from Arthur because he fears Arthur would hate him if he found out, a feeling all too familiar to queer kids developing crushes on their presumed straight friends.

As the series progresses, the dynamic between the two becomes even clearer. Arthur seems to prefer the company of Merlin to most *anyone* else. And though Arthur falls in love with a servant girl named Gwen, that only intensifies Merlin's hope, as it means Arthur *can* love a servant. And when Merlin goads Arthur into revealing his true feelings about Gwen,<wbr off /> it sounds like he's talking about Merlin.

</james>
<from></from>

Man: "Right... so he's like that with all the maids that come up?"

Gwen: "No."

And then, Arthur's father dies. And since he was the homophobic-- I mean, magic-phobic? -- <wbr on />son of a bitch that was making everyone's lives so difficult, it's the catalyst for Arthur to become his own person, a king. He can think the way he wants to and love who he wants to.<wbr off /> So it's telling that at a single point in the show where he feels the most isolated emotionally, the most down, the most defeated... he <wbr on />looks to Merlin with longing. He realizes he's not alone, that he'll never be alone, because Merlin is with him. And from that point on, he not only shows real respect for Merlin, but admiration.<wbr off />

When Merlin is in danger, Arthur rides to his rescue. The king doesn't send his Knights to save his servant, he goes himself to save his partner. At the end of the series, after a battle with Morgana and Mordred leaves Arthur mortally wounded, his final words are for no one but Merlin.

Obviously, Merlin and Arthur are never confirmed to be gay. But the chemistry between the two characters was so potent, from the *very* beginning of the series, that fans immediately ran with it in <wbr on />fan fiction.

### Sherlock 

Sherlock began its on-again-off-again run on the BBC in 2010. A modern reimagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Victorian mystery novels, Sherlock explores the lives of the residents of 221 B. Baker Street London. Those being John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. The gay question is actually brought up before they even move in together.

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.sherlock %}>

Watson: "You don't have a girlfriend then?"

Sherlock: "Girlfriend? No, not really my area."

Watson: (staring in concern) "Alright... Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine by the way--"

Sherlock: "I know it's fine."

Watson: (quickly) "You you got a boyfriend--"

Sherlock: "No."

Watson: "Right, okay."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Sherlock then does assume John is coming on to him, and explains he's too wrapped up in his work to be in a relationship. While this could easily be read as a fun misunderstanding, Sherlock is a *master* at reading people. He's practically psychic at times. So if he read the situation as if John had a hard-on for him... well, maybe he did! Hell, when the waiter approaches Sherlock, he assumes John is his date!

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.sherlock %}>

Waiter: "Sherlock... anything on the menu whatever you want, free. On 'e house for you and for your date."

Sherlock: (to Watson) "Do you want to eat?"

Watson: (to Waiter) "I'm not his date."

</clip>
</compare>

So one must presume that Sherlock has brought men here before. And Sherlock isn't the one to deny it. John is. Emphatically.

Another person who knows Sherlock very well would be his land lady, who also assumes Watson to be Sherlock's boyfriend.

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.sherlock %}>

Watson: "I've met someone."

Landlady: (squeal, claps hands) "Oh, lovely!"

Watson: "Yeah. We're getting married. Well, I'm gonna ask anyway."

Landlady: "So soon after Sherlock?"

Watson: "Well, yes."

Landlady: (smiling wide) "What's his name?"

Watson: (sighs) "It's a woman."

Landlady: "A woman?!"

Watson: "Yes, of course, it's a woman!"

<wbr on />Then there is Mary, the woman John eventually gets married to. She's a special one, someone who understands his relationship with Sherlock and even encourages it. They kind of become a thruple for a while. Until she does the one thing Sherlock could never forgive. She hurts John. John forgives her, but Sherlock holds on to that anger until the day *she* dies, jumping in front of a bullet to protect him.<wbr off />

So, does Sherlock love John? Yes. He might be the only person he *does* love. Does John love Sherlock? Everyone certainly seems to *think* he does. Is it ever confirmed, really, one way or another? *Of course not*, because confirming it one way or another means that you might lose one group of fans or another. The oblivious straights or the love struck shippers. They knew better. They knew how to queer bait, and become an international hit show doing it. Plus, it's extra egregious because one of the shows creators, Mark Gatiss, is gay himself!

### Harry Potter


God damn it British people I said we'd be getting back to the Wizards didn't I Harry Potter and the cursed child is a two-night play that's been dominating the West End and Broadway since it first opened in 2016 now since it's a play without a whole lot of live footage we'll be relying on quotes from The Script here but before I even start Alvis Potter and Scorpio Malfoy are gay don't care what anyone says not going to change Chang my mind now why do I think this well let's start off with how they meet Albus and his cousin Rose are on their way to their first year at Hogwarts Albus opens a door to look in on a lonely blonde kid Scorpius in an otherwise empty compartment alus smiles scorpus smiles back well that's innocent enough two boys smiling at each other doesn't scream gay agenda to me eventually rose leaves the two and we get this description Scorpius and Albus look at each other and something passes between them things pass between me and my Straight friends all the time when we were starting puberty no big deal the play moves on to follow the lives of our two boys over the next few years focused obviously on Albus since he's Harry Potter's kid and all we learned more about albus's life at home his awkward relationship with his family he feels like he doesn't fit in especially after being sorted into Slytherin with a family entirely made up of gryffindors say same for Scorpius he doesn't live up to his father's expectations either he's a bit weird kind of a goofball which doesn't fly with the Malfoy family so although they both feel alienated from their families they feel at home with each other a safe harbor in an otherwise Rocky sea Harry tried to make Albus feel welcome but he just doesn't understand his son it's an easy allegory for parents of queer kids trying to be accepting but they're just can't get it right Scorpius is the only person that alus feels comfortable with alibus hugs his friend with fierceness they hold for a beat Scorpius is surprised by this okay uh hello um have we hugged before do we hug the two boys awkwardly dislocate alus will not hug his father or family but he'll hug Scorpius fiercely with passion so because the structure of this play is a bit off we're in year four now and Albus wants to go back to his father's fourth year and save Cedric diory from being murdered because that's something his father couldn't do so he and Scorpius ditched the train to Hogwarts in order to find the last surviving Time Turner and save Cedric if we're doing this we're doing it together tagging along with them is a girl who in case you haven't seen the play or read the script I don't want to say who she really is because it's a spoiler and stupid but there's a girl named Deli or delie and Albus kind of digs her and Scorpius is conflicted about this Scorpius appears at the back of the stage he looks at his friend talking to a girl and part of him likes it part of him doesn't delie won't be going back in time with them though because reasons as they make their way through the Forbidden Forest the pair talk about their lives and Albus reveals how how much he hates it at Hogwarts how terrible it is for him not for me Albus looks at his friend shocked all I ever wanted to do was go to Hogwarts and have a mate to get up to Mayhem with just like Harry Potter and I got his son how crazily fortunate is that they more or less succeed in Saving Cedric but when they return to their time everything is odd Albus is in Gryffindor now and Harry doesn't want him seeing scorpus anymore I need you to stay away from Scorpius Malfoy what Scorpius I don't know how you became friends in the first place but you did and now I I need you to my best friend my only friend he's dangerous this reads painfully like a parent finding out that their son has a boyfriend and telling them that under no circumstances are they to see them again alus gives in and Promises not to see Scorpius anymore alibus you're okay that's fantastic he's completely cured and we've got to go alvus looks up at Scorpius and his heart breaks he walks on are you mad at me what's going on alus stops and turns to Scorpius did it work did any of it work no but Albus Albus whatever gibberish you're talking you need to stop it now this is your final warning Albus looks torn between his dad and his friend I can't okay you can't what just we'll be better off without each other okay Scorpius is left looking up after him heartbroken Harry's a dick hell even Draco becomes the voice of reason confronting Harry about the situation I'm not here to to antagonize you but my son is in tears and I am his father and so I'm here to ask you why you would keep apart two good friends not keeping them apart you've changed School timetables you've threatened both teachers and Albus himself why Harry looks at Draco carefully and then turns away I have to protect my son again Harry is a dick later on delie approaches Scorpius Albus needs you Scorpius that's a wonderful thing he needs me to do what that's the thing isn't it about friendships you don't know what he needs you only know he needs it find him Scorpius you two you belong together scorpius's life is even worse now that alvus isn't in it the two eventually have a fevered argument that leaves Scorpius even more distraught and lost people think he's the son of Voldemort complicated very complicated stupidly complicated he thinks he's a terrible person that maybe all the horrible things said about him are true Albus disagrees no they're not true and I'll tell you why because I don't think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son and you're kind scorpus to the depths of your belly to the tips of your fingers I truly believe V Voldemort couldn't have a child like you be Scorpius is moved by this that's nice that's that's a nice thing to say and it's something I should have said a long time ago in fact you're probably the best person I know and you don't you couldn't hold me back you you make me stronger when Dad forced us apart without you I didn't much like my life without you in it either the two boys reconcile finally realizing that they need each other in their lives they go back in time again to fix the mistakes and the timeline but they screw it up even worse so bad now that Albus doesn't even exist Dolores Umbridge is head Mistress of Hogwarts and baldemort is still alive time travel is problematic in this new timeline Scorpius is super popular the guy everyone wants to be but he hates it he wants his old life even with how unhappy he was none of this new happy life is worth it because he can't have Albus with him Scorpius finds out that Snape is still alive and approaches him to help in getting Albus back Snape along with alternate timeline Ron and Hermione agree to help Scorpius in the process Ron and Hermione are attacked by Dementors Albus is terrified but Snape tells him that the memory of one person one person who makes you so happy that memory is enough to defeat the Dementors Snape even compares how Scorpius feels about Albus to how he felt about Lily Potter as problematic as Snape's infatuation with Lily is he loved her and he sees that scorpus feels the same way for Albus taking the Albus scorpus relationship Beyond even a teenage romance and into a love that lasts for decades the death murder war and Magic cannot stop and unlike with Snape and Lily though Albus feels the same way they're completely devoted to one another scorpus succeeds in bringing Albus back and is speechless when he sees him again though Albus is completely unaware of what's taking place and thinks he's only blacked out for a couple of minutes Scorpius grabs him and hugs him tight the rest of the play is pretty much a hot mess eventually dark Wizards are after them ready to go in for the kill so we hide in a hole as pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next 40 years they'll find us and we'll die and time will be stuck in the wrong position no we we need something we can control something we know he'll get exactly the right time we need to there's nothing still if I had to choose a companion to be at the return of Eternal Darkness with I'd choose you Good Winds out over evil of course and Albus and scorpius's lives go back to normal and at the very end of the damn play we get a forced scene where scorpus acts like he has interest in a girl because even the writers knew these two were in love with each other but families were going to go see this so God forbid we don't know omo them as hard as possible in the last 5 minutes so she who must not be named has said there will never be a cursed Child movie which Warner Brothers might disagree with considering how well this play is doing but I think she's right because no one will be able to watch this movie and not see these two boys as gay no matter how many no homo endings you tag on honestly Harry Draco kind of helped create modern gay fan fiction and then alvus and Scorpius were this close to making a version of it Canon this close I am thoroughly convinced that at some point in the writing process the playwrights did intend on them being gay and it got switched somewhere along the line it's not unheard of it's not the first time that's happened the reboot SL sequel to The Oceans 11 franchise Stars an amazing almost all female cast including Sandra Bullock Kate Blanchett Aquafina Sarah palson an hathway Rihanna Helena bottom Carter the first time I watched the movie I was honestly shocked at how a major movie with some of the biggest stars in the world had two lesbian leading characters but then the movie ended and oh they're not lesbians I call [ __ ] Debbie ocean played by Sandra bulock and Lou played by Kate Blanchett are essentially a couple I don't care if it's never stated in the movie they're a couple or at least they were a couple before Debbie landed in The Slammer and I wasn't the only one who saw this queer people around the world noticed it even straight people one could even argue that this movie is meant to set straight women onto the proper path of lesbianism and crime but nothing of the sort is ever stated outright in the movie so why did so many people read it that way well first off blanchett's character is coded extremely gay the outfits that she wears are crafted to queer Perfection but if you look past the aesthetic glory of the film you'll see that there's a real love between Debbie and Lou coming at this film with a queer lens I initially felt like the filmmakers were saying it without actually saying it giving us queer characters whose whole point in life isn't just being queer characters while telling about her history of running Cons with Lou Debbie refers to Lou as as her partner business partner life partner yes when recalling a rock bottom moment for the two when they were pulling scams at a retirement home's Bingo night Debbie refers to this as their rough patch were they strapped for cash or On the Rocks romantically again yes queer people would read this phrasing as an obvious admission of their lesbian relationship while straight people would just read it as a they're such good friends because straight people can be clueless like that there's actually a term for this obliviousness in the gay community it's called the Great straight divide when straight people are so clueless they actually believe that two men are roommates or two women who have lived together for 20 years are Gallop Pals additionally there's physical flirtation between the duo in a diner Sandra spoon feeds Kate a bite of her food in a very intimate lady in the [ __ ] esque manner I don't know about you but I never delicately play sporkful of diner food onto my platonic friend's tongues whenever the duo interacts it's clear there's a shared intimacy between them that the other women in the crew don't experience with each other so for me nothing about their relationship points to just being friends and honestly I could keep going on but it's actually been confirmed Sarah Edwards costume designer for the movie said in an interview after the film's release you know early there was an idea that Lou and Debbie having been in a relationship might have been the case but we seem to move away from that as shooting went on so when they started production Lou and Debbie had been in a relationship but by the time they'd wrapped that was no longer the case secret lesbians confirmed Now give me a sequel so they can kiss [Music] already oh God here we go hitting TV screens in 2011 the MTV show became famous for its propensity to show nearly naked men in nearly every episode maybe it was their way of paying reparations for the I'm not a [ __ ] I'm a werewolf line from the 1985 movie the whole show is pretty gay if we're being honest kind of like a teenage version of True Blood in more ways than one but the relationship that drove the series into will they won't they territory was between lovable nerd Styles and brooding Alpha werewolf Derek fondly known online by the couple name sterk much like with Merlin the pair start the series off on a bad paw but over the course of a few seasons end up in a scenario that if they a man and a woman would undoubtedly end in a relationship but because they're two guys well Dad there's a conversation that we you're not gay I could be not dress like that uh I thought you like girls I do like girls you absolutely great so you also like boys absolutely do you so pretty quickly it set up that style is bisexual is it set outright no of course not that would be too easy but is it made painfully obvious I don't think Danny likes me very much I asked Alison on a date and now we're hanging out am I not attractive to gay guys I make first line and the team captain wants to destroy me and now I'm going to be late for work wait Scott you didn't am I attractive to gayot you didn't answer my question everyone wants you you know you're like the hot girl that every guy wants hey come on Jackson you're way too pretty to be out here all by yourself we should maybe take this upstairs he's might tyght okay how you can come too and I also got to say this new found heroism has making me very attracted to you shut up no seriously try make it out for a second just to see how it feels yes yes it is when Styles and the main character Scott go to a gay bar Styles even gets frustrated when a guy buys a drink for Scott and not for him why are they at a gay bar because it's Teen Wolf why would wouldn't they be at a gay bar one more question what do you find me attractive someone needs to have sex with me like today like someone needs to sex me right now all right I'll do it what come to my place at 9:00 plan to stay the night I like to cuddle that was so sweet are you kidding yes I'm kidding okay you know you don't toy with a guy's emotions like that Danny it's not attractive all right okay this is becoming a look how queer Styles his clip show so let's move on to Derek Derek is straight very straight he has all the girlfriends he's emotionally distant locked off and doesn't like being touched but Styles can't get him off his mind no more questions no more talk about the alpha or Derek especially Derek in one episode Derrik is paralyzed by a monster and has to be held afloat in the middle of a pool by Styles because the monster can't swim Styles holds him up for over two hours much like Merlin Styles risks his life for Derek over and over and over again and becomes visibly jealous when girls show interest in his hunky wear crush his feelings for Derek are not subtle and this is not an accident even the action is pointing toward romance whether it's obvious or not take this scene where they're both paralyzed again Styles files on top of Derek the same way that we've seen women fall on top of men in a 100 romantic comedies the way they lock eyes time and time again the way they annoy each other needle each other but always come to the rescue this is not subtle this is on purpose in an interview with after Elton Show creator Jeff Davis said said I'm trying to create a world where there's no racism there's no sexism there's no homophobia and I know it's not real life but I kind of don't care I'd like to create a world where none of that matters you have the supernatural creatures for that to work as an analogy in my mind if you can create a world like that on TV maybe Life Starts to imitate it that's a very Noble Pursuit but it's not realistic to even try to achieve it there are plenty of out queer characters on Teen Wolf but none of them are leads the steric fandom became rabbit online with art and fanfiction becoming just as popular as the show itself some of the cast encouraged the shipping including Dylan O'Brien and Tyler hin who would cuddle with each other at Fan events they baited sterk as a couple they baited Styles as sexuality with absolutely no intention on following through the reason this is so onerous is because the queer baiting didn't even stay in the show they moved it over into real life Styles wasn't just coded adorably bisexual they used queer baiting to get you to do something for them vote for us uh it's Team Wolf for best summer show yeah team Choice summer show something just find Team Wolf and vote for it just whenever you see Teen Wolf fill in that Circle cuz we really appreciate it and we'll take more naps like these for you maybe on you screen yeah now I'm going to be stuck to that Derek all the way I don't know maybe I'm inordinately frustrated by this because Dylan O'Brien's so cute this is probably the most obvious example of queer baiting to have ever existed in monitored media but it wasn't the most well-known bringing out the big guns now arguably the three biggest media franchises in the world right now are Star Wars Frozen and the Marvel Cinematic Universe they all have a few things in common they're all owned by Disney and they've all been accused of queer baiting Disney is actually kind of terrible for this not only do they queerbait their characters they actually create queer media and then yank it away from you love Victor was a sequel TV series to the hit film love Simon it was announced alongside Disney plus as one of the big reasons to buy into the service but then when the show actually had gay content Disney shafted it over to Hulu which is not available in nearly as many places as Disney plus essentially segregating a gay show that they had promised their viewers putting it on a service with a fraction of the subscribers that way when the ratings aren't that great they can just say it wasn't popular and let it die maybe even use it as an example as to why queer content doesn't sell like I said in my Stonewall film effect video as far as executives are concerned a queer movie or show or book that fails always fails because it's queer never because of the circumstances around it okay r over [Music] Frozen there's not a whole lot to show about Frozen because most of the queer coding is in song and Disney will come down on me with the intellectual property Hammer if I play a song from Frozen but the first film was read as super queer by a sizable portion of the population so much so that homophobic bloggers accuse Disney of indoctrinating children with the gay agenda but they wouldn't have anything to WR about if children weren't being indoctrinated in the gay agenda so let's ignore them but actual lgbtq fans of the film latched on to Elsa being the first potentially queer Disney princess creating the Evergreen social media Trend #g Elsa a girlfriend Let It Go became a sort of a gay anthem and the film featured queer icon ad Menzel in the lead and gay heart throb and my future husband Jonathan gra voicing Kristoff so fans were hoping for a lot when Frozen 2 finally hit theaters this past year while the film didn't State Elsa SE uality one way or another it left the door open hinting at a gay relationship between her and honey Maron and the new song show yourself while not a cultural phenomenon like Let It Go became a gay anthem I mean with these lyrics how could it not every inch of me is trembling but not from the cold something is familiar like a dream I can reach but not quite hold I can sense you there like a friend I've always known I'm arriving and it feels like I am home I have always been a fortress cold Secrets deep inside you have secrets too but you don't have to hide show yourself I'm dying to meet you that's right Elsa you run down that ice vagina but seriously though those lyrics sound like an email I wrote to my online boyfriend in Ohio in the seventh grade so is Elsa gay uh maybe Frozen 3 is in development so Elsa might climb out of her safic slump or Disney will continue to not say yes but not say no either just like they did with one of their other Global spanning [Music] IPS Star Wars the Force awakens introduced us to PO and Finn a rebellious pilot and a stormtrooper who meet up by chance Escape together and fall madly in love well they didn't tell us they fell madly in love but the actors certainly showed it when they escaped the first order they crashed land when Finn comes to he searches for po but he's nowhere to be found Assuming he's dead Finn is heartbroken and takes POS jacket as a reminder of [Music] him Finn is then set up for what would usually be a love story with the lead female character Ry but no that doesn't go anywhere Finn shows interest for sure but it's not reciprocated leaving the door open for Finn to fall in love with someone else else maybe and eventually we find out that PO is still alive and we get this [Music] scene H what happened to you what happened I got thrown from the crash I woke up at night no you no ship nothing you completed my mission Finn that's my jacket oh oh no no no no keep it it suits you the eye [ __ ] oh my God before the movie was released the cast went on to the Ellen show it's very subtle romance that's happening you know you have to just look very close you have to watch it a few times to see the little hints but there was at least I was playing romance I was in the cockpit I was playing there was a very deep romance I see so though it wasn't obvious Oscar Isaac and John boa were certainly playing it that way so would it be more obvious in The Last Jedi well leading up to the release of The Last Jedi Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy was asked about the potential relationship she said we've talked about it but I think you're not going to see that in the Last Jedi in the next 6 or eight months we will have some meetings about the stories that we will develop next after 40 Years of Adventures people have a lot of information and a lot of theories about the path these stories can take and sometimes those theories that come up are new ideas for us to listen to read and pay attention to so not the Last Jedi okay running out of time here guys about rise of Skywalker well JJ Abrams teased for months before the film's release that there would be real LGBT representation in the film a gay kiss even obviously fans thought it would be Po and Finn but no instead Abrams made sure to give po a female love interest neuter fin entirely and tossed in and out of focus blinking you miss at lesbian kiss between two ascended extras after the release of Rise of Skywalker Oscar Isaac had this to say in an interview like there was an Absol absolute natural chemistry with him uh I I immediately felt very connected to him I remember uh it was an audition and the two of us just like did that first scene back to back butt to butt you know just like doing the scene together practicing it in this room and like it was just like immediately all you know all kind of artifice everything just collapsed and there was like an intimacy that was very just like there and um and I think the fact that neither of us shied away from that while we were shooting as well I think it just was like these are two guys that you know are he happy being intimate with each other emotionally and that um so it wasn't actually a total shock that you know you know people you know wanted to you know saw that in there personally I I kind of hoped and wished that maybe that would have been T taken further uh in the other films but you know I don't have control over that so he wasn't happy about it the fans shipping Fino weren't happy about it the gay community wasn't happy about it and the rise of Skywalker became the lowest grossing film of the new Trilogy Star Wars is now in brand rehab at Disney who are trying to figure out what to do with the property after it seemed like no one could agree on any of their Five Star Wars movies that they made to date with solo bombing at the box office and Rise of Skywalker coming nail-bitingly close to losing money I'm not saying making Po and Finn gay would have saved the box office probably the opposite to be honest but at least Disney could have said that they did something before any other Studio that they put gay characters in a giant cinematic spectacle before most studios are willing to even give us a movie at all but this is the company that tossed love Victor back into the streaming closet so what else would we expect I mean I'm sure Disney hasn't done anything like this before what was [Music] that Steve Rogers AKA Captain am America AKA Chris Evans because he's the real superhero and Bucky Burns AKA The Winter Soldier are two of the many many many characters in the Disney owned Marvel Cinematic Universe they were originally created way back in the 1940s when Bucky was actually Steve's kid sidekick because every superhero had to have a kid sidekick fast forward 70 years and about 100 iterations later and we see the pairing that become known the world over as Stucky right from the off there's a sort of Chemistry Between them with Bucky kind of acting as a big brother figure to Steve who needs help fighting the bullies in his life Steve's got a big heart but that's about the only part of him that's big wait does the Super Soldier serum make your one of the things I noticed the first time I saw the movie which was the first MCU movie I saw by the way was that Steve seemed way more interested in joining the Army than being with girls it's easy to read this as him just being so darn patriotic but it was actually extremely common for gay men in the first half of the 20th century to join the military and all male environment seemed pretty appealing to a lot of gay men at the time even if you did run the risk of getting shot by a Nazi but at least you'd die a hero instead of people back home finding out that you're a queer and dying ashamed and alone there's also a hint of gay shame Steve feels like he's not good enough not a real man and he wants so badly to be like everyone else that he's willing to go through a very risky procedure to make it happen was this gay coding in the 1940s of course not it was just a superhero origin story it may not be allegorical but it's certainly applicable which is something that makes superheroes so Timeless no matter who you are no matter where or when you live you can project yourself onto a superhero but I'm not here to say that Captain America and Bucky Barnes are gay I'm here to say that the mcu's Captain America and Bucky burns are gay now of course Steve is madly in love with Peggy Carter but look at the woman she's smart she's gorgeous she's a badass how could you not help but fawn over her she's not just any woman she's one hell of an exceptional woman and also the obligatory love interest but she's awesome so we'll ignore that you must have danced well that's going a woman to dance always seems so terrifying in the past few years just didn't seem to matter that much figured I'd wait for what right partner interesting use of the word partner there could have said the right girl so after Steve becomes Captain America Bucky is captured and presumed killed by Hydra the super Nazis and Steve goes out to save him Bucky means the world to him and if there's even a chance of him being alive he's not going to lose him cap Saves the Day of course and this tiny gesture I don't know it really caught my attention the first time I saw the movie as they're escaping the facility begin begins to melt down but Bucky refuses to leave without Steve eventually they both escape and the dynamic between them changes Steve is no longer the little guy looking up to his Bud bucky bucky is now admiring Steve becoming his partner fighting the Nazis with him until Bucky falls from a train into a frozen European Wasteland below this breaks Steve the All-American man of men superhero breaks down into tears the loss of Bucky he's seen so Much Death in this war so much Carnage so much loss but it's the loss of Bucky that breaks him then Steve decides to die rather than be with Peggy and crashes a Nazi super plane into a glacier where he's found a few decades later and resurrected because superheroes then in Winter Soldier we find out that Bucky isn't dead he's been kept Alive by Hydra all this time and is an assassin for them again because superheroes so while Steve is slowly acclimating to living in the 21st century the return of Bucky shakes him to his core a part of his life he thought he'd lost forever is back Steve's already seen Peggy but she's not the Peggy he knew she's aged dying he still cares for her of course but Bucky's the same age as Steve give or take he's like a memory plucked from the past and placed smack dab in Steve's present like Steve he's a part of a world that no longer exists so even though Bucky has been brainwashed and has the blood of hundreds of murdered people on his hands Steve cannot bring himself to kill him not his Bucky not in this world of a new millennium where being LGBT Isn't So frowned upon and maybe he and Bucky could be a real thing Peggy even kind of gives Steve permission the world has changed none of us can go back all we can do is our best and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over and Bucky's the only person in this whole wide crazy world that Steve feels he can really connect with though Bucky doesn't remember Steve and everyone around him tells him Bucky needs to be taken down Steve refuses he hopes Beyond hope that he can bring Bucky back not just to save Bucky but to save himself to be not so alone after fighting in a doomed Helicarrier Steve backs off takes off his helmet and bears his soul to Bucky literally dropping his shield something he hasn't done before something that's only worth it because it's for Bucky he does this again in Civil War literally and metaphorically letting his guard down for one person and one person only when Bucky holds Steve's life in his hand about to land the killing blow Steve tells him to do it then finish it CU I'm with you to the end of the line Steve trusts Bucky even now in this demented State he trusts him with his life and we can see in Bucky's eyes he's remembering he's remembering his friend looking down into his face he sees someone he loves he can't kill him and when Steve falls from the Helicarrier with Bucky Left Alive he could just let him fall and drown in the water below but he saves him just like Steve saved him back in World War II so even after being reprogrammed a 100 times by Hydra the memory of his love for Steve is so strong platonic or romantic it doesn't matter their bond is so strong that he overrides all of that programming and saves the most important person in the world to him Bucky disappears in Into The Ether after that but Steve knows he's alive out there and he won't give up looking for him a mission that culminates in Captain America Civil War in Civil War Steve is willing to let the Avengers fall apart to save Bucky he's willing to let the might of the whole world come down on his shoulders to save Bucky even after it's revealed that Bucky killed Tony's parents he still won't let him go and by abandoning his shield he's even willing to leave the identity of Captain America America behind because he doesn't need to be Captain America anymore he doesn't need to be an Avenger because he's got Bucky so Steven Bucky love each other even Joe Russo the director of Civil War said so calling the movie a love story between the two Heroes now you can say James they're just good friends these arguments often start out under the guise of progressive thought making claims like they's so few examples of non-toxic masculinity and media so we need more portrayals of a positive friendship between two men this sounds like a good argument at first until you think about it for a minute or two and remember that almost all media is about male relationships and male friendships when it comes to Captain America and Bucky Barnes specifically that well has been tapped quite thoroughly the relationship between two men who fought alongside each other in a war has been the topic of many stories throughout Millennia it's one of the most popular male friendship stories ever and why shouldn't that relationship go beyond just a friendship does it ruin the value of the Friendship if it's also nonplatonic The Iliad story of Achilles and Patrick's relationship should serve as an early Counterpoint here ideally people in a relationship with one another would also be friends if the idea of characters being in a relationship ruins that for you then perhaps you should think about why you feel that way and flip the coin for a second say Bucky's a woman watching these movies seeing this relationship would you think for even a second that these two people aren't going to end up together in the end really but of course they don't because [ __ ] Disney and oddly enough the Stucky pairing would probably be the most Disney friendly gay relationship they could have because fans of the proposed couple aren't fans because of the expected sex sure there's plenty of porn online of the two of them if you're willing to go look for it but that's not what draws people to them it's a bond between them it's a bond that lasts for decades travels through time goes through Hellen back and yet in the end they're still dedicated to each other it's a love story I don't even think it was done on purpose to be honest unlike Teen Wolf and Sherlock I don't think the writers wrote this pairing or the actors played these parts with the intent on baiting gays into loving them we were going to go see Chris Evans anyway it's just kind of happened a natural outgrowth of the Chemistry Between the two actors playing two characters that are innately drawn to one another I think it's a beautiful accident that can be read as either platonic or romantic love the fact that so many gay people read it as being a queer Love Story just shows how starved we are for representation in movies just like in the days of queer coding we're willing to dig deep into our favorite media to find any hint of us possibly being represented whether those golden nuggets are actually there or not but we keep looking and looking someday hopefully very soon there will be a gold rush even if right now we're only finding Fool's Gold this video has been a long time coming I originally started working on it about a year ago and it was called for the love of Stucky and was just a look at the Stucky relationship to say it's grown a bit as a bit of an understatement uh I'm hoping to get another video out oh maybe sooner than a year from now uh you can check out my patreon if you'd like to help out in the production of these videos or just like share and subscribe nothing gets this channel out there more than that you can also follow me on Twitter at Jor Summerton or check out my Community page to vote on what video I'll be doing next so thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this Beast of a video uh I will be back soon with more content I promise so until then take care stay
