Mankind has always found an innate horror in things that are different. An evolutionary reflex to protect itself from the things that may be dangerous to them or their loved ones. <mark>Eons ago, human beings found *Homo erectus* to be terrifying, because it was different. Leading to their assumed extinction.</mark>

</james>
<comment id="homo_erectus">
{{ site.tustin.header }}

This is a whole lot of speculation with nothing to back it up. For one, "Homo erectus" ***is*** a "human being", in that scientists classify them as [one of the "human species"](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/homo-erectus-our-ancient-ancestor.html#:~:text=H.%20erectus%20is%20the%20longest%20lived%20of%20all%20human%20species). And we have no way of knowing if other species of early humans found them terrifying.

And, the current going theory as to why they went extinct was [due to climate change](https://www.insidescience.org/news/final-days-homo-erectus) and not, as is implied here, other humans being terrified of them and killing them.

This is not entirely unlike the reaction toward homosexuality from the heterosexual majority. Something different. Something strange. Something queer. Something that goes against what they believe to be the natural order of things. And that in and of itself is the initial seed of horror. Being afraid of things you do not understand, things that do not belong, creatures and events that go against your own survival needs. A son or daughter that bears no children could possibly lead to the end of your lineage. And what else do you exist for other than to procreate?

In the days and years before the rise of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, what was there to civilization but creating the next generation of people? And homosexuals both men and women *could* (theoretically) put a stop to that. And so it can be assumed that from the very beginning of time homosexuality was looked at as not just a societal other... but a danger to mankind itself.

Though like many things existing before the written word, this proved to be untrue, this idea (along with other fanciful creations of pre-history) has survived into the modern age. The notion of homosexuality as a danger to mankind as a whole has been disproven time and time again. But sometimes ancient teachings are hard to be forgotten. 

And so the queer entered into the horror canon. Centuries before hollywood even existed, before horror movies graced the silver screen, before the works of Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley sent chills down reader spines... before the people of Salem burned those accused of being witches alive. Before even the murder of Saint Sebastian.

The fear of the unknown, according to the American Psychological Association, is one of the most prominent causes for anxiety among people in both the first and third world. It accounts for the hatred toward anything existing outside the norm. In bathroom laws across the United States, in the banning of immigrants, in the murder of non-white people, in the remaining animosity toward homosexuals, and anyone looked at as queer.

But this was not always the case. For millennia, homosexuality and gender fluidity were not things to fear, but things to embrace, if not celebrate. Egypt had gay and lesbian and (by all accounts) transgender pharaohs and queens. Mesopotamia had gay kings. Most of the ancient Greek philosophers were gay or bisexual. Rome had gay emperors and senators. Even early Christianity was more or less accepting of gay men.

But that didn't last.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Along with the dark ages came a great tumult that led to the fear of anything and anyone non-Christian. Women became witches, gay men became warlocks, and the very idea of homosexuality was attributed to demonic possession, if not from Satan himself, than from the pagan deities that lingered and swept down from the north.

And that is where our story of gay horror picks up. Hundreds of years later, with a coven of witches.

The term "warlock" mean "male witch" only in modern times. It means ["oath-breaker"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlock#Etymology_and_terminology) (as in breaking your oath to god) in Old English, and thus would be gender-neutral. "Witch" is similarly gender-neutral in Old English, [having male and female forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word)#Etymology).

Also, though it may have happened occasionally, it doesn't look like attributing being gay to "demonic possession" was a widespread thing, [instead just being a sin and looked down upon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Catholic_Church_and_homosexuality).

*The Craft*, released in 1996, holds an odd appeal within the lgbt community. There are no queer characters but... the coding...

The film follows the story of <mark>four teenage girls who each grow up feeling different</mark>, in one way or another. <mark>Special</mark> and above the fray of their peers, or <mark>rejected</mark> by them entirely, <mark>as so many queer teens have experienced</mark>. Either being praised for their artistic prowess in theater, art, or dance, or roundly rejected by the populace at large for being different.
{% assign timecode = "5:55" %}

By happenstance the four <mark>girls end up in the same school and find each other essentially by cruising the hallways. Sideways looks and quiet nods to each other lead to a hookup, which for them is going shopping for candles after school.</mark>

The most memorable character, by all accounts, <mark>is Nancy</mark>. And <mark>she's already out as a witch</mark>, openly <mark>practicing the craft</mark>. <mark>She wears goth lipstick and black laced up Stevie Nicks boots. She has a sexual history and a noose hanging in her locker.</mark>

<mark>Bonnie</mark> is a girl with <mark>self-image issues, due to scars that cover her arms and back. Like so many queer kids, she just wants to be left alone, yet</mark> <mark>she fears</mark> that in the end that's exactly the thing that will happen: that <mark>she'll grow up lonely</mark>, never finding love.

<mark>Rochelle</mark>, <mark>the only Black character</mark>, <mark>faces racist comments from the other students</mark>, <mark>angering her but only insofar as pouting</mark> about <mark>what they did to her cashmere sweater</mark>. This isn't a movie about racism, after all, it's about <mark>witchaphobia</mark>.

And finally <mark>Sarah</mark>, <mark>the main character, isn't sure about her identity</mark> at all <mark>in the beginning. She starts out... craft-curious.</mark> This is <mark>her journey. She's confronted with peer pressure and her own internalized witchaphobia.</mark> <mark>Back at school, the next day, she doesn't want to be rejected by the popular kids, so she downplays her relationship with Nancy, Bonnie, and Rochelle.</mark> 

<mark>Chris</mark>, your typical teenage movie <mark>football jock, persists in making bullying comments about the three spiritual deviants, who he calls "The Bitches of Eastwick".</mark> Because he's <span hbomb="Wow, what a great addition, Jimmy.

Nothing in this movie's script can get in the way of the real social justice issue, which is <mark>witch-phobia</mark>.

<mark>Sarah</mark> (Robin Tunney), <mark>the main character, isn't sure about her identity</mark> <mark>in the beginning. She starts out craft-curious.</mark> This movie is about <mark>her journey. She is confronted with peer pressure and her own internalized witch-phobia.</mark> On their first night together, Sarah asks the others "do you guys really believe in this?" <mark>Back at school the next day she doesn't want to get rejected by the popular kids so she downplays her relationship with Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle.</mark> <mark>Chris</mark>, the <mark>football jock, persists in making bullying comments about the three spiritual deviants, whom he calls "the Bitches of Eastwick."</mark> He explains, "when you're a guy, and I am, people expect things." Very similar to often heard statements, 'Boys will be boys' or 'Don't be such a f*gg*t.'

<mark>After the four witches have confirmed each other's witchy tendencies, the four take a bus to the witchy part of town, where a young person can go and be themselves. A safe space with no anti-witch judgment.

Being released the same year the Defense of Marriage act was put in place, and only two years after the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was passed, *The Craft* became an instant hit, and a cult sensation, that would be played at gay halloween parties for literally decades to come. 

As mentioned before, the connection between witches and homosexuality has gone back centuries, if not millennia. Lesbians were accused of witchcraft more than any other group of women. And gay men were regularly accused of being warlocks, or simply possessed by Satan. It's always funny, really, that the Christian Right Wing believes that God's main adversary is so interested in us. We should take it as a compliment, really.

In modern Wicca, homosexuality is highly embraced. <mark>Although heteronormativity was a strict rule among Wiccans in the early-to-mid 20th century</mark>, newer Wiccan traditions often avoid or disregard the historical aversion to LGBT people. These new traditions often cite the charge of the Goddess, which states ["all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Goddess#:~:text=all%20acts%20of%20love%20and%20pleasure%20are%20my%20rituals). Many queer Christians have found that the teachings of the church led them down the path of Wicca and witchcraft.

There seems to be very little information on Wiccans prior to the 1950's, when [Gerald Gardner introduced it to the public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca). We don't know anything about such a rule. The only maybe inkling to something like this was [accusations of homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Gardner#Homophobia) against Gardner.

## Bullied

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Based on the best-selling novel by queer ally Stephen King, *Carrie* tells the story of Carrie white, A teenage girl trying desperately to make it through her high school years. she's bullied for being a bit different, for being shy, for not fitting in, and like many young Christians, doesn't feel at home in the stifling environment of an evangelical household. 

possibly the most obvious queer coding in the story is when Carrie's ultra religious mother actually locks her in a closet, declaring that she'll be sent to hell and punished for being who she is, if she continues down this sinful path.

Carrie has a crush, you see, on the high school heartthrob, Tommy. and like many a gay boy and girl in their high school years, he is completely unattainable, until he's not. until he's suddenly interested in Carrie, a predicament both thrilling and terrifying. How many queer high schoolers have been in that position? Having a crush on a boy or girl, thinking there's no way that they could possibly be into you, that they're most likely straight. Approaching them romantically may even end in violence, especially in the 1970s, when the book and movie came out. This can easily be placed on most high schoolers who feel like they don't fit in but, it's particularly salient for queer kids. 

I myself had a crush in junior high, we'll call him "Dan". He knew I was gay and seemed relatively accepting. but the ever-existing caveat "but I'm not gay, so you know, don't try anything" always hovered over the friendship. I knew there was no chance. And then, one night, my friends and I were having a movie night. Six of us were piled into my room watching Bram Stoker's Dracula, itself full of queer imagery. And while most everyone had spread out around the room, Dan and I ended up in my bed. A single bed with barely enough room for me, let alone another six foot soccer player. He didn't seem to mind though. Nothing happened between us, of course, but knowing that my straight best friend was okay practically cuddling with me made me pretty happy.

No such luck for Carrie White though. Or most queer kids. After much bullying, even by characters not coded strictly as villains, Carrie is invited to the prom the epitome of high school heteronormativity. Not just invited, but invited by the most all-American crush she could possibly have, the epitome of the high school crush archetype. Not of his own volition, mind you, but by the cajoling of his girlfriend Sue, who seems to be the only decent person in the entire school.

But Carrie doesn't know that. She gets to believe, for just a little while, that a boy like that could really like her. And to make it all that much better, the rabid bitch who's been making her high school life a living hell won't even be there, thanks to the help of a coded lesbian gym teacher. Eventually voted prom queen, Carrie's on top of the world.

And then the rug is pulled out from under her. A bucket of pig's blood is pulled from the rafters coating her head to toe. And suddenly the realization hits. The fear that every queer kid holds down deep inside, that they'll be accepted lauded even, just for it all to be one big practical joke. Pranks like these are not uncommon. There's a reason every outsider in high school fears them. Pig's blood usually isn't involved, but raising up an oddball student to the very highest of heights just to push them off at the edge... It does happen.

This is when most would run off the stage in horror and shame, hide from the people who did this. But not Carrie. Not unlike the videos we see of high school kids fighting back against their bullies, Carrie strikes back in a vicious and bloody attack... that leaves the prom coded in even more blood than she. 

Fires rage around the gymnasium as she makes her way through it, a revenge fantasy for every teenager who has ever been othered, made fun of, bullied, attacked, held down. Carrie's a horror to mainstream audiences, terrified of the other. But a hero to queer kids and everyone who doesn't fit in, a literal horror superhero.

Of course, in the end, from my point of view anyway, Carrie is all about shame. Much like the shame of gay teenagers in certain types of families, certain kinds of home towns, not fitting in, being ostracized even when you try to fit in, and this shame is personified by Carrie White. Gay audiences form a connection with Carrie unlike with most horror heroines. She is the internalized anxiety within us, the yearning to be something more, to fit in, and yet be ourselves. To not be bullied, or at least to fight back against the bully. 

But we're not all Carrie White. Sometimes that self-hatred internalizes, something dark and morbid roiling within our bodies. A demon ravaging our very soul.

## A Hellbound Heart

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Demons are not just beings of pain and torment in Clive Barker's *Hellraiser*. They're moral abominations, creatures so lost in hedonism, they've long since forgotten the difference between pain and pleasure. Demons that could be mistaken or even accepted for... angels, from a certain point of view. Though many would question the queerness of *Hellraiser*, it lurches well beyond breaking heteronormativity. It skins it alive.

Written and directed by Clive Barker, and based on his novella *The Hell-Bound Heart*, *Hellraiser* tells the story of <mark>Frank Cotton</mark>, a man who has broken every imaginable sexual taboo, who has crossed every human limit, and has still not met his fill of sexual sadism. BDSM has become all too vanilla for him. And so he searches out an infernal <mark>puzzle box</mark> that, when <mark>solved, summons interdimensional beings</mark> known as <mark>the Cenobites</mark>, creatures that <mark>dwell in a realm of extreme carnal indulgence, where people</mark> are willingly subjected <mark>to severe forms of sadomasochism that include, but are surely not limited to, being torn apart by hooks and chains.</mark>

The queer BDSM culture of the time welcomed *Hellraiser* with open arms, indulging in its allegorical portrayal of kink, polyamory, and queerness. This subgroup of the LGBT community grew quickly in the 1980s as a way to experience sexual pleasure that didn't involve penile penetration, avoiding HIV by learning a whole new way of enjoying pleasure. And pain. And to many in the queer community, they were looked at as freaks, monsters, horrors to be avoided at any cost.

That accepting the fact that a BDSM subculture *exists* within the queer community further others us from the heteronormative white picket fences of the suburbs. And what is a queer person if they're not accepted by the suburban rabble? A monster, of course.

But there's an odd attractiveness to the monsters of *Hellraiser*. When they move and speak there's a certain degree of attractive nobility in their appearance. These debauched angels may commit visceral acts of savagery, but they also possess a surprising grace and eloquence.

Frank *the man*... is the monster. The man you'd walk by in a mall and not give a second look. The man you'd say hello to in an elevator. *He* is the real beast in *Hellraiser*, not the Cenobites.

The hell priest, eventually christened "Pinhead" by fans, though Barker loathes the name, is not a mindless killer, like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. He's not a killer of innocents, like Freddy Krueger. He is reasonable and only comes when called, keeps to himself in his own realm, much like the queer community that lived in cities and was not infiltrating suburbs, as so many white americans feared in the late 1980s. Though he and his fellow Cenobites would grow closer to their slasher brethren as the *Hellraiser* series went on, in the original, he is not the monster to be feared. The perfectly normal *person* was.

*Jennifer's Body* is the story, more or less, of Anita Lesnicki, "Needy" for short. Once an insecure teenage girl, she is now a violent inmate in a mental ward, narrating her story from solitary confinement. Since early childhood, she had been friends with the titular Jennifer. Though they had little in common, with Needy being shy and reserved and Jennifer being a cheerleader.

Together the pair attend a local rock concert at a bar, where Needy's life changes forever. A fire with no known source engulfs the bar, killing multiple people. Needy pleads with Jennifer to stay with her, but in her shock, she leaves with the band. Later that night, she turns up at Needy's house covered in blood.

So off to Briarcliff she goes. Though loathed upon release, the film has more recently been reevaluated as a modern horror classic. It's fun, messy, mean, sad, campy, and self-aware. It's worth mentioning that the advertising campaign for *Jennifer's Body* was *deeply* flawed, portraying it as a sexy thriller in order to play off of star Megan Fox's hotness.

As mentioned before, later that night a bloodied, maimed, non-verbal, and snarling Jennifer staggers over to Needy's house in the middle of the night, desperate and hungry, though Jennifer is unable or unwilling to communicate in words what's happened to her, her physicality is speaking
volumes. This is clearly a nod to both physical manifestations of trauma and a general reference to women in horror movies, and in real life, who can't talk about what's happening to them, for fear that they won't be believed or understood.

This scene doesn't just focus on the horror of the situation though. The sexual tension between the two also comes into focus as Jennifer narrowly resists biting Needy on the neck. Looking more like a *kiss*, than a potentially violent act.

Their relationship is stretched thin over a tumultuous friendship between teenage girls. But more than that it speaks to the nature of attraction between young women, whose relationships can be... incredibly intimate even between two straight girls. So when one or both of the girls are gay or bi, the thin line between platonic female friendship and sexual female love can become an emotional war zone.

Jennifer uses sex as bait to attract male victims to devour, but shows no romantic interest in any of them. They're prey, nothing else to her. One scene shows the uncomfortable simultaneous acts of Jennifer seducing a soon-to-be victim while Needy makes love to her bumbling boyfriend. Looking at the scene through the eye of a film editor, it's easy enough to see what's happening: Jennifer is the aggressor in her scene, while Needy is the submissive partner in hers.

The cutting back and forth can easily be read as an editing trick to make the mind see Jennifer and Needy having sex, backing up that interpretation is the fact that Needy abandons her heterosexual coupling in order to seek out Jennifer. After a series of scares, she returns home alone, unable to find her friend. Crawling into bed she finds Jennifer there waiting for her, wearing one of Needy's shirts, a girlfriend move if ever there was one. 

This scene of vulnerability culminates with an actual kiss between the two girls. Needy pulls away, demanding to know what Jennifer has been up to. She tells her her story ending it with the line:

After all that though, Needy begins to doubt Jennifer's story, feeling her control and her closeness to Needy slipping, Jennifer reaches for the nearest easy target. By trying to make Needy insecure about her relationship with Chip, suggesting that Chip is having second thoughts about her.

This is the first but not the last effort of Jennifer's to drive a wedge between the couple, and doing so right on the heels of an attempted romantic overture is *hard* to read as *anything* else than her wanting Needy for herself. The lesbian coding is incredibly obvious.

To me there's a very interesting reading of *Jennifer's Body*: that queer teenage girls whose sexualities are only starting to bloom can easily become confused about their relationships with other girls. Straight girls and women have much closer more intimate relationships than straight boys and men. If you see two girls holding hands, you might not think anything of it. If you see a girl running her hand through another girl's hair, she's probably just trying to help her relax. Kiss on the cheek, or even lips, that's nothing. If you hear two women say "I love you", you don't immediately think "lesbians". While there is a much stricter code of conduct for men and boys: no hand holding, no hugs that last for too long, and a kiss or an "I love you", even between fathers and sons, absolutely not.

And so there's a bit of gay male privilege there: if another boy or man is acting very close and intimate, the assumption can be made that he's, at the very least not homophobic, and quite possibly open to something more. The situation is easier to read because there are so many barriers put up between men. A possible upside to toxic masculinity.

But for young women how can you tell if another girl is interested in you in a romantic or sexual way? Because she kissed you? Held her hand? Cuddled? You've likely been doing that with female friends all your life. As if being a woman wasn't hard enough already.

## The Others

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

1979's *Alien*, directed by Ridley Scott, is often considered as one of the first "feminist" science fiction movies. With its powerful central female character and themes of reproduction and sexual violence, the film has become lauded for being a cornerstone in feminist film theory. It's also monstrously queer. Not only is Ellen Ripley a strong butch heroine, who does not *at all* fit the usual sci-fi or horror female archetype, but according to David McEntee, author of *Beautiful Monsters*, the film also plays very deliberately with male fears of female reproduction. Forcing the gestation of life onto male characters and literally tearing them apart during birth. 

But the queerness in alien reaches beyond the obvious. When writing the screenplay Dan O'Bannon wanted to focus more on developing the Xenomorph as a character. And so when writing the crew he left them more or less generic, which included their gender. A note on the script reads:

> "The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women."

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

From the conception of this story, there is a rejection of performative gender. From initial perceptions all of our characters are similarly gendered neutral. They wear the same loose jumpsuits and are addressed by their surnames, removing any bases for gendered pronouns. The ship's male mechanics complain about being paid less than everyone else, including the female crew, at a time in america when women were being paid 60 cents for every dollar a man made.

Once cast, and the actors were given the freedom to play their parts as masculine or feminine, star Sigourney Weaver decided to play her character as completely gender-neutral. In horror, especially at the time of release, female characters were *always* portrayed as victims or damsels in distress. While in *Alien*, Ripley is neither of those things. She's strong and self-reliant.

Furthermore, when Ripley asserts authority in the team after Dallas is caught by the Alien, Ash, the male robot, feels threatened and attempts to dominate Ripley to regain his masculinity. He's a genderless robot, however he exemplifies constructed toxic masculinity, aggression, a fragile ego, and stubbornness. He attacks Ripley who exemplifies gender neutrality and sexual equality. Literally attacking her with gender conformity by shoving a porn magazine down her throat. 

Another male character Kane is orally raped by the facehugger. This leads to a forced impregnation, leading to death in what is essentially childbirth. Removing the assumed male privilege of avoiding the pain of childbirth and bringing it to a horrific conclusion. Not only is kane raped and killed, but gives birth to a vicious bloodthirsty phallus.

It's been no secret that H.R Geiger designed every form of the Xenomorph to represent sex organs, both male and female, masculine and feminine. The overt and grotesque sexual imagery in the alien is designed to evoke fear and anxiety. Which is how society was already responding to sexual openness and breaking out of what it means to be typically male and female. The aliens phallic and vaginal components are used together in stark contrast from the traits and qualities usually assigned to them. Thus deconstructing notions of gender. The alien's body is overtly sexual and blurs our ideas of anatomy. 

The horror and sexual violence from the alien, including the penetration of Lambert and forcing Dallas into a womb-like egg as an allusion to motherhood, suggests that having one pair of genitals or another doesn't make you inherently violent, but that society's construction of gender is to blame. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We get a less coded queer representation in 1986's sequel, when for a split second, we see a biography of the character Lambert from the first film. The biography establishes Lambert as having had her gender reassigned from male to female. Lambert's bio reads:

> "Despite conversion at birth from male to female, so far there are no signs of suppressed trauma from gender reassignment."

And so in a horror movie from 1979, we technically have a transgender character who is never othered, never misgendered, and is not a villain. A retcon that changes nothing about the story, but adds trans representation when little if any was available. James Cameron's *Aliens* is curiously progressive in its sexual politics overall, especially for a movie released during the Reagan years. Take for instance the exchange between Hudson and Frost:

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.alien %}>

Frost: "Hey, I sure wouldn't mind getting some more of that [actereian poontang]."

Hudson: "Yeah, the one that you had was male"

Frost: "It doesn't matter when it's acturian!"

</clip>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So the butch space marine slept with a man. And nobody makes a big deal out of it, except for Frost who wants to do it again. And he is wholeheartedly supported. This isn't just queer behavior being portrayed in a positive manner, but one of the many ways that the movie obfuscates gender and supports a pansexual ethos.

The queer icon of *Aliens*, though, is the female space marine Vasquez, who is tougher than most of the men in her squad in a movie released 27 years before the United States military even let women take on combat roles. But is she herself queer? the actress who played her, Jeanette Goldstein, weighed in on that question in 2016:

Elsewhere in the film is Bishop another sexless cyborg like the first film's Ash. David Grevin in *Demeter and Persephone in Space* observes:

> Bishop, the cyborg retooled as a queer suffering body, is an example of a resistant masculinity devoid of any obvious sexual desire. Such figures suggest queer sexuality in films and television in that their refusal of the normative codes of masculinity suggest an alternative to them.
>
> As with Ash, but much more pitiably, the white blood that drenches Bishop suggests both mother's milk and semen. But in a radical decontextualization, semen here... suggests the vulnerability of male bodies, their susceptibility to violation, rather than unseemly urges. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.bart_bishop at="¶ ?" %}>


</from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Grevin further suggests that the aliens, and especially the alien queen, represent a cisgendered heteronormative status quo that resents the changing times. what gives this entire spectacle of shaming its radical charge is the queer typing of Ripley as mother. With her short hair and male garb, Ripley combines the masculine and the feminine. 

With her casual indifference to heterosexual sex, despite some no sweat flirtation with Hicks, she suggests the possibility of different sexual needs. With her adoption of a child, she suggests the lesbian mother who thinks outside the normative procreational box. The alien queen's vicious contempt conveys the charge of an old customary inability to recognize the beauty and heroism in queer love of the kind Ripley and Newt embody. 

Read as a queer allegory, Ripley, Newt, the reintegrated android Bishop, and the wounded vulnerable and bedridden Hicks, together constitute the new queer family. The alien queen, a repository of old modes of contempt and hate. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.bart_bishop at="¶ ?" %}>

<james {% include timecode %}>

So while Grevin suggests that the conservative alien queen has contempt for the queer family dynamic, the metaphor could go even further. Cameron creates a future where gender norms have all but disappeared. Even subtle things like fashion, such as the female Weyland-Yutani executive at Ripley's hearing wearing a power suit and sporting an androgynous haircut, to the fact that the marines have a co-ed locker room suggest the battle of the sexes ended in a draw. 

It's the alien queen who, although she rules over an army of male drones, is actually trapped within the biological determinism of her sex forever, cranking out eggs, she ironically wants to destroy this new world and turn back the clock a few centuries. There's also the AIDS allegory of the entire alien franchise. Though obviously not intended for the first film which came out before AIDS became well known, the sexual imagery of the Xenomorph's many forms, and the imminent death associated with them, make H.R Geiger's beasts easy analogues for the deadly bloodborne virus. Especially in the sequel, where just one alien, one drop, of infected blood or semen, can create such an infection that completely overwhelms the host planet... or body. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This became especially prescient with the release of Alien 3. The death of Newt and Hicks before the film even begins is central to this message. AIDS seemingly kills at random. The young and innocent like Newt. The healthy young men like Hicks. Or, like Ripley, you might avoid the disease by pure luck. 

Then there's the population of Fury 161, an almost completely abandoned prison planet. One of the higher ups realizes that they can potentially wrangle this little alien problem into a profitable venture, much like how big pharma companies worked on releasing oppressively expensive treatments instead of working toward a cure.

Hitting like Larry Kramer's 1987 speech when he launched ACT UP.

A monster so ravenous, there is no escape. But not all monsters are so obvious.

## Death by Monogamy

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

*It Follows* tells the story of Jay, a 19 year old suburban girl who acquires a sexually transmitted curse from her boyfriend Hugh. After they first have sex Hugh sedates her, forcing her to heed his instructions about the curse. She must sleep with someone as soon as she can in order to pass it along to another person. And on and on, or else she'll be tracked down and killed by an other-worldly entity, the titular "it". If it kills her, it will resume tracking Hugh, since it follows only one person at a time. 

The monster in *It Follows* may be a supernatural being, but the film's true source of horror is living under a regime of sexual shame, where our heteronormative culture compels sexual subjects toward monogamy, even at the risk of their overall well-being. Though many critics pointed out that *It Follows* cleverly subverts the usual "you have sex, you die" trope from 1980's slasher movies, few grasped the idea that the monster in the film would, more or less, become harmless in a society where sexual promiscuity was the norm. Having sex with new partners on a regular basis, constantly shifting its targets, to the point at which it could follow, but never catch up in time to kill.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

At a glance *It Follows* would seem unlikely to have a queer reading, since it doesn't feature any queer characters or monsters that could be easily coded as such. Nor does it feature any of the homoerotic undertones of movies like *A Nightmare on Elm Street II*, *The Lost Boys*, or *Rope*. Instead its queerness is less monolithic. 

For some viewers, a horror movie that depicts sexual partners spreading a deadly curse via sex might seem deeply sex-negative. Indeed, many reviewers saw the film's central conceit as tapping into the fears of anyone who came of age during the AIDS crisis. The threat of AIDS has, of course long, been allegorically linked to popular horror imagery, like the aforementioned *Alien*, John Carpenter's *The Thing*, David Cronenberg's *The Fly*, or any number of post-80s vampire tales. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But the film's queer lesson is less about the avoidance of sex than the management of risk. After all according to the film's logic, those infected by the curse can survive only by successfully finding new sexual partners, versus remaining abstinent and living out the fatal consequences of their prior sexual history. The film barely acknowledges that Jay has any other option but to find new partners, and it's her hesitance to move beyond a series of monogamous bonds that could ultimately prove to be her downfall. 

Therefore the film implies that having a sex life is inevitable and always involves a certain level of risk, emotional or physical. But the film also suggests that the danger truly lies in the social attitudes that make sex and promiscuity shameful. We're also told very clearly that Jay was not a virgin at the beginning of the film when she acquired the curse. And therefore the allegorical infection shouldn't be looked at as some kind of punishment for premarital or non-procreative sex, as it would be in so many other movies in the genre. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Importantly neither Hugh nor the film in general ever specify which sexual acts will successfully pass along the curse, thus opening plenty of space for queer speculation. Is heterosexual sex the only option? Will same-sex partners do the trick? Do oral or anal sex count? What about non-genital forms of sexuality: S&M, kink, or masturbation, maybe? Just how conventional and vanilla are the expectations of this paranormal being?

The idea of destigmatizing promiscuous sex was particularly timely when *It Follows* hit theaters. Media attention had just begun addressing the slow growing popularity of drugs like Truvada as a way to stop new HIV infections. Not only does the drug reduce the likelihood of a positive person passing on the disease, in some cases making it impossible, but can also prevent the disease from taking hold if taken by HIV negative people, thus reopening a part of queer sexual life that had been more or less shut off since the 1980s.

But anyone who mentioned that they were using the drug, commonly known as PREP immediately found themselves being slut-shamed. Many doctors could be judgmental of patients asking for the once a day pill, thrusting their moral opinions on a medical issue. And so, for some time, many people in the gay community refused to ask their doctors for a prescription. Shaming people for wanting to add an extra layer of safety to their sex life. PREP is much more common now, resulting in transmission rates of the HIV virus dropping dramatically. 

But, for a time, right around the release of *It Follows* the shame of being seen as promiscuous by doctors or friends stopped a lot of people from getting the new little blue pill. Until then anything but monogamy, even with a condom, was looked at as a risky, dangerous, and irresponsible behavior in much of the queer community. 

</james>

*It Follows* appeared at a historical moment when a hetero- turned homo-normative model of monogamy was upheld as law of the land/ while a countervailing trend saw the partial overcoming of long-time anxieties about the most infamously fatal of sex-born diseases, opening fresh possibilities for sexual autonomy. The film may not have been deliberately intended as a socio-political commentary on such shifts. Indeed David Robert Mitchell, the film's writer/director, left the monster's motives and weaknesses nightmarishly unexplained and open to interpretation. But the place of queerness as a sort of structuring absence within the film, an unnamed but perpetually haunting presence still speaks to a queer audience.

But just like how PREP has not completely disposed of HIV, the monster in *It Follows* is similarly relentless. Following a traumatic confrontation that ends with Jay agreeing to pass the curse along to a boy who's had a crush on her since childhood, the apparently monogamous couple walk hand in hand down a quiet suburban street, unaware that behind them *It Follows*.

## Disturbia

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Not all horror movies deal with the supernatural. Some are more than happy to terrify you with what you know best. Your friends, your family, your home, turning something mundane into something truly terrifying, bringing horror to a place that it never
should have been. 

That's something that horror expert Wes Craven did all too well. By making the violent killer of a film someone you would have usually sympathized with in *The Last House on the Left*. Perverting the relative safety of dreams with *A Nightmare on Elm Street*. Blurring the lines between horror and real life with *His New Nightmare*. And then bringing horror to the safest of all places in Clinton America, the suburbs, with *Scream*.

Written by out-gay screenwriter Kevin Williamson, *Scream* tells the tale of Sydney Prescott, who a year after her mother's murder is having those old wombs figuratively and literally reopened. But the queerness of the film has nothing to do with Sydney or her mother, but with the killers, Billy and Stu, as well as the uncomfortable social changes toward a more LGBT-accepting society in the late 1990s.

In terms as resonant as they were phobic, *Scream* was a cry of despair over an apparent immorality in the Millennial or late-Gen X youth, especially in the male population. The homoeroticism of the Billy-Stu relationship, which the film develops into an all-but-explicit queer love affair, shows both the unpredictable, anarchic, bewildering, behavior of the generation, and the shifts in male gender roles synonymous with it.

*Scream* redeploys the long-standing American tradition of a homoerotic bond between a pair of young male killers. The foundation of the tradition is the infamous Leopold and Loeb case. These wealthy young men were University of Chicago students who murdered the fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks in 1924. Both were sentenced to life in prison, with one of them being murdered by another inmate shortly after sentencing.

This case generated several fictional treatments including Hitchcock's 1948 film *Rope*, which I covered in ["Monsters in the Closet"](4zPCM14-SCQ.md). These killers considered themselves to be Nietzschean supermen, using their superior intellect as justification
for their thrill-killing. 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

Billy and Stu, however, have no such lofty philosophical ambitions. Their motivations are family- and romance-driven. Billy claims to be avenging himself for Sydney's mother's crime of destroying his family. And Stu seemingly is just doing it for Billy. 

*Scream* also offers contrasting portraits of masculinity ,but only in order to intensify its vision of an increasing cultural depravity. Perhaps the first touch that links the killers to queerdom is Ghostface's first appearance to Sydney. He tries to trick her into believing that he's on her front porch. The killer then jumps out of her closet instead. 

There's also the image of Sydney's open closet door protecting her from harm. I might be reaching here, but it's not hard to read that as "it's better to have your closet door open than closed". Skeet Ulrich's performance as Billy and especially Matthew Lillard's as Stu deepened the queer resonance that stand forever on a knife's edge of obviousness. 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

Ulrich's bloody intensity and perpetual white t-shirt clearly evoke James Dean in *Rebel Without a Cause*. The intense look in his eyes, either sad or cunning, keeps the audience as off-balance to his identity as it does Sydney. But when he does reveal his murderous identity, the facade dissolves entirely and he passes through intensity into truly frightening. The dark underbelly of his pristine all-American geniality. 

Lillard's Stu, meanwhile, is notable for his gender bending potential. He uses his basketball player height, rubbery face, and excessive emotionalism to create a memorably frantic character that would shock no one if he suddenly appeared in full drag. In one scene set in the video
store where Randy of Movie Geek works, Randy theorizes about Billy's possible identity as the killer. In perhaps the most homoerotic moment in the film, Billy suddenly swings upon Randy challenging him.

As Billy gets in Randy's face, Stu comes up from behind him in a shockingly intimate almost threesome. What has been called femmephobia intersects here with homophobia, as the killer's increasingly inept performance of gender mirrors their ultimately inept attempt to craft
the perfect murder plot. Craven makes the interesting choice to stage the big revelation scene at the climax of the film... in the kitchen. The Mama's Boy Killers reveal their nefarious identities within the domestic space most closely associated with the mother.

Earlier in the film, Billy and Sydney have sex after she announces that, if life is one big movie genre, her pick is porn. Ghostface suddenly appears right after they've finished and seemingly stabs Billy to death. One can assume that he's been watching them do the deed the entire time. Of course, we soon learn that this is only a ruse to distract Sydney from Billy's real identity as one of the killers. Billy staggers back to life in his seemingly blood-drenched t-shirt. Getting possession of the gun Sydney had been wielding, Billy shoots Randy and then dabs a finger in his blood and brings it up to his lips. 

There's also the Negative Oedipus Complex. Homosexuality is the chief aspect of it. In a footnote added in 1910 to his 1905 three essays on the theory of sexuality, Sigmund Freud conjectures homosexual identity emerges from an identification with the mother. And Billy is nothing if not obsessed with his mother. While many have read Freud's theory as homophobic, it would likely be fairer to say that it's been put to homophobic use in American psychiatry, which historically used it to pathologize homosexuality as an arrested development.

What *Scream* makes vividly clear is the cultural reception of narcissistic mother-identified desire. The killers and *Scream* are monstrous not only because they kill, but because their desire proceeds from identification with the mother. What complicates or is left deliberately unresolved by the filmmakers is the specific nature of the boys' relationship with each other.

Stu's desire is left especially unclear but in some ways it is his desire that more clearly has a basis in the homoerotic. Stu has a girlfriend, dispatched via garage door, but his chief affection is directed toward Billy, to whom he's quite clearly devoted. What is most significant about Stu's relationship with Billy are the ways in which Billy's desire becomes Stu's desires, becoming an easy analog for the feeling of many gay teenage boys who will do *anything*, play any sport, see any movie, take any drug, in a desperate attempt to connect with their male crushes.

A queer reading becomes more obvious at, least to me, when the pair of killers decide they need to stab each other in order to frame Sydney for the killings, penetrating one another to show their devotion, replicating the pain of virginal anal sex. 

*Scream* with its queer coding, delicious dialogue, and willingness to reach into camp territory when necessary, has become a classic slasher among the queer community. While we watch it as a smart send up of the genre, which was well and dead in 1996, many people of the more hetero persuasion see the film a bit differently. Ut's the horror of danger coming to the suburbs, a place of safety being perverted, where nice white families fled to in order to escape the poor, black, and queer horrors that filled the city streets. 

And in *Scream*, the queer horror penetrated that safety. It also tore apart the idea of the ideal american family. Billy's family was torn asunder when Sydney's mother had an affair with his father, leading to a divorce and his mother leaving town. And so he took Sydney's mother away from her too. The fragility of the straight nuclear family coming to a bloody end just as the new millennium dawned, showing us all that families, though a nice idea, can lead to unexpected horrors.

# Home Is Where the Hell Is

<james {% include timecode %}>

In 2017, a perhaps unlikely queer icon emerged in the form of a black and white cartoon character from Australia with sharp teeth, theatrical makeup, and a top hat. This cultural phenomenon began with the 2016 Tumblr thread initiated by online user e-instagram, who declared Mr Babadook, the titular monster from Jennifer Kent's 2014 horror film, to be fearlessly and proudly gay. 

In his initial post, instagram wonders:

\[Quote shown on screen, wipe fade]:
> Whenever someone says that the Babadook isn't openly gay it's like...  
> Did you even watch the movie?

Sparking what participants called a "baba-discourse", scores of others weighed in on the tumblr thread, with one user proclaiming <q>The B in LGBT stands for Babadook.</q> 

The next several months saw the proliferation of queer Babadook memes, and multiple representations of the Babadook at 2017 pride festivals across the United States. The Babadook has emerged as a queer icon because he can be read as having characteristics associated with cultural gayness. For example, he wears dramatic costuming that recalls the theatricality of drag. And he struggles against a rather literally closeted existence, in which many disavow or reject him/

While references to these characteristics abound in the typically humorous and ironic examples of the character's queerness, this monster, and the film from which he emerges, call for critical attention to normative constructions of the family. The hegemony of reproductive heterosexuality and the implications of both for the lives of women. 

That is: the Babadook invites queer appropriation *because* he represents the horrors of heteronormative family life. And gender politics. While socially conservative rhetoric frequently casts the family as a site of innocence imperiled by outside forces, *The Babadook* constructs the family as a site that is too often constituted by multiple forms of systemic physical and emotional violence. 

Narratively, *The Babadook* (written and directed by Jennifer Kent) is the story of Amelia, a single mother, and her only son, Samuel. On the day her son would be born, Amelia and her husband Oskar have a car accident on the way to the hospital, and Oskar dies. Having given up her career as a writer to earn a living as a nursing home attendant, Amelia has been Samuel's only caregiver, an isolating experience exasperated by both other people's uneasiness with her grief, and by their ableist discomfort with Samuel's differences.

Amelia's ability to care for her son becomes severely constrained when she decides she must remove him from his school, which seems unwilling or unable to accommodate his needs. At the same time, Samuel becomes fixated on an invisible monster that he warns lives in their house. When a mysterious and violent children's book appears, Amelia begins to fear that the monster is not a figment of Samuel's imagination. And soon she and her home are tormented by a boogeyman known as the Babadook, who lives under her child's bed and in his closet. 

As anxiety sleeplessness and trauma take a toll on Amelia, she first directs her anger at Samuel becoming violent, before eventually confronting the Babadook. She realizes she can never fully rid their lives of the monster that now resides in their home. She determines to make relative peace with it, locking it in their basement, but keeping it well fed and alive. 

As illustrated by a line in the Babadook's book, the more you deny the stronger I get. The monster operates as a signifier of Amelia's grief over Oskar's death. The more she represses this trauma, the more power it has to return and disrupt her life. 

This allegory is not, however, the only one at work within *The Babadook*. Amelia appears as a 21st century sister of Rosemary from *Rosemary's Baby*. As the Babadook crosses the horror formula of "other as villain" with the female gothic interest in gendered experience and victimhood, transforming the beleaguered female protagonist herself into a monster, backing up the idea that the greatest monsters do not come from without, but from within. That perhaps the monsters in heteronormative suburbia did not come from the outside, from cities, but that they've been there all along.

And how does one become a suburban monster? By trying to fit in. Amelia is struggling financially and the depiction of the life she leads with her son shows the economic vulnerability of single-parent families, especially single mothers. Her stress to keep everything running smoothly to try for normal is what drives her to become the maternal monster that strikes out at her own son. 

The Babadook on the other hand, ostensibly coded queer, does no actual harm to Amelia or Samuel. It is just the fear of him that causes harm. It is the societal pressure of the heteronormative world that causes harm. Amelia's paranoia, the sense of being watched, originates in the way her public life is dominated by, and private life intruded upon, by institutional and bureaucratic forces that scrutinize her, and especially her parenting. First, the representatives of the school system that had failed Samuel, and then the community service representatives that take over. 

Then, there are the disturbing encounters with others that she hopes will help her. The doctor who judges her when she requests sleeping pills to make Samuel sleep, so that she herself can sleep. And the desk sergeant in the police station who, when Amelia attempts to report a stalker, looks back at her with the strange pale eyes of the storybook monster. Both encounters show historically strained relations between institutional authorities and women under threat. society is actively and passively harming her. While the queer monster remains mostly benign.

In acknowledgment of these real everyday social pressures on Amelia, the form taken by the Babadook references the familiar source of her madness and monstrosity. There are elements of Samuel, as the Babadook's garb recalls the little boy's homemade magician's costume, while the threat of its mouth in the pop-up book offers a horror movie version of Samuel's screams for attention. 

And then there's the house, a victorian style house that Kent had constructed specifically for this film, and that operates as a character in its own right. Specifically of note are the ways that the home in the film diverges from both idealized constructions of the home and the role of the home within the horror movie genre. The signifier of the home often functions as an allegory for heteronormative, sexist, ablest, and classist figurations of family. How homeownership is often considered a milestone for success and stability for those a part of, or wishing to be a part of, the heteronormative masses. How often the home acts as a site for the production and regulation of bodies that are normatively gendered and sexed. And how consistently the culture of suburban home life, and typical design practices, presume that a house's inhabitants will all be fully abled, thereby rendering them inaccessible to those who are not physically ideal.

The single-family home acting as a sort of moated castle, protecting the inhabitants from the working poor they might otherwise come across in an apartment building. Or the infirm in a nursing home. Or the other races or queers in select ghettoized areas. But in *The Babadook*, those others infiltrate the home and cause no harm. Threaten. yes, but never act. Only the self causes harm, not the other. 

The Babadook's queerness lies in its subversion of the family, in its apparent danger to what is accepted by society, by only growing in power the more it is denied. Like a gaping wound that begins to fester each time a person lies about their sexuality. Every time someone pretends to be someone they're not so that society will accept them. 

And there's an odd draw to the black and white monster for queer people. Outside the movie, it was looked at as a joke, like so many queer icons initially are. Cher, Judy Garland, Dolly Parton, all looked at as over-the-top and worth nothing more than derision. And then they enter into a cultural permanence once they're adopted by the queer community.

> "Someone was like, 'How could "The Babadook" become a gay film,' and the answer was readily available." 

...said Karen Thompson, an associate professor of gender studies in English at USC.

> "He lives in a basement, he's weird and flamboyant, he's living adjacently to a single mother in this kind of queer kinship structure."

He exists in a half-acknowledged state by the other people in his house. The family is afraid of what he is, but finds a way to accept him over time.

> "For many lgbt people, that's what it feels like to be in your own family sometimes."

Naturally, there are counter arguments. The Babadook never says he's gay, he never displays physical attraction to another person, but historically fictional characters haven't needed to say "I am gay" outloud to be read as queer, or to become queer icons.

> "So many LGBT people have been barred from seeing themselves represented in popular culture, so we've had to project ourselves into so many of these figures."

Thompson said,

> "There are ways to read into the character itself and the structure of how this ostensibly monstrous thing becomes incorporated ultimately into a family."

But is the Babadook gay? When asked about this in 2019, director Jennifer Kent simply replied...

> "Of course."

Sometimes it's just that simple. Sometimes the monster, the queer, can be accepted. Sometimes suburbia isn't so bad. But sometimes... *it*... can be a nightmare.

## Trauma

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

*IT* by Stephen King was published in 1986 and has made a lasting cultural impression. The novel inspired a mini-series, two movies, and ruined clowns for generations of children. <span hbomb="Ha, good one.">And adults frankly</span>. Pennywise transforms into things that will scare people the most and Stephen King used the 1950s setting to pay tribute to classic movie monsters. 

Since its release, the novel has inspired fans to discuss its themes, allegories, and underlying subtext. A common discussion is the interpretation that Richie Tozier and Eddie Kasprak had strong repressed gay feelings for one another. The most recent adaptation, *It: Chapter 2* directed by Andy Musgetty, dedicates an entire subplot to the romance between Richie and Eddie. There have been protests that the character's change in sexuality comes out of nowhere, but that's not so quite cut and dry.

When Eddie first encounters Pennywise, the titular "It", he's at a place known to attract hobos and drifters. It takes the form of a hobo who's stricken with disease. It uses a leper to frighten Eddie instead of your typical horror movie monster.

\[Quote shown on screen:]
> One of these fellows had crawled out from under the porch of the house at 29 Neibolt Street one day and had offered to give Eddie a blowjob for a quarter. Eddie had backed away, his skin like ice, his mouth as dry as lintballs. One of the hobo's nostrils had been eaten away. You could look right into the red, scabby channel.

> "I-I don't have a quarter" Eddie said, backing toward his bike.
>
> "I'll do it for a dime," the hobo croaked, coming toward him. He was wearing old green flannel pants. Yellow puke was stiffening across the lap. He unzipped his fly and reached inside. He was trying to grin. His nose was a red horror. 
>
> "I... I don't have a dime, either," Eddie said, and suddenly thought: Oh my god he's got leprosy! If he touches me I'll catch it too!
>
> His control snapped and he ran. He heard the hobo break into a shuffling run behind him, his old string-tied shoes slapping and flapping across the riotous lawn of the empty saltbox house.

Eddie's physical manifestation of fear has symbolic meaning that is linked to his abusive upbringing. Eddie sees it as a leper because his mother's insistence that he is sickly and delicate has made him afraid of disease. Eddie is horrified of the leper's appearance, but the real terror doesn't set in until he realizes that he could catch its illness. The leper uses the offer of sexual favors to scare him. nowhere else in the story does Pennywise threaten the children with sexual assault, so its decision to do so *here* is an important distinction.

 this metaphor is significant because the leper is a sickly diseased man offering oral sex to Eddie and its combination of these things shows us a deep fear Eddie has unknown even to himself Eddie's afraid of doing sexual things with men because he believes he will get a disease and die its use of the leper as a manifestation of Eddie's fear is our first clue that Eddie is queer-coded because he is groomed to fear disease and sickness he fears his own homosexuality and views it as something that could kill him though this section of the book takes place in the 1950s the book itself was published in the chaotic midst of the aids crisis when gay sex really could lead to a disease and death we also get some interesting religious imagery as Eddie thinks back to the root of his religious fear he's quick to dismiss religious rules as stupid but stops himself as he remembers he takes religion seriously enough to be afraid of it it's interesting that Eddie fears going to hell even though he's never done anything to warrant it reading Eddie's inner turmoil as the result of suppressed homosexual feelings it makes sense for Eddie to wonder about going to hell because of who he is rather than something he's done another coded aspect of Eddie's hidden sexuality is how he interacts with the other losers in one scene Stephen King singles out Eddie as being delighted by bill we get an explanation for Eddie's unmatched joy when Eddie tries to imitate bill modelling himself after the boy in order to come across as brave Eddie idolizes bill and his love is rooted in that admiration there are many references to Eddie having hero worship for bill or seeming to love bill more than the other losers this is disguised as Eddie simply idolizing bill but it reads much clearer as an unrequited crush on him with Eddie simply not knowing how to categorize it another member of the losers club that hits home with queer readers is Richie a character many people even straight readers have interpreted as being bisexual he like most of the boys in the group has at least
a bit of a crush on beverly the lone girl but also a clear connection with Eddie as well not just in friendship or love
but in trauma childhood trauma looms under the skin of the losers club well into adulthood as it chapter 2 explores the
reunion of the crew in their hometown for most of the children their trauma existed on the surface of the first it film
Eddie's overbearing mother beverly's father verbally abusing her and sexually taunting her as she begins to grow into
her adult body mike seeing his parents burned alive six out of the seven losers left dairy as soon as they were old
enough leaving allowed them to forget the trauma but leaving didn't remove it just tucked it away out of sight where it
could seep out and impact their life later on both beverly and Eddie married a version of their abusive parents bill now
a writer can't think of a happy ending ever since his little brother georgie was murdered by Pennywise stanley is so
terrorized by his childhood torment that he kills himself when he finds out that it has returned like every person on
the planet the losers remain trapped in their trauma they've just found new ways to cope Richie ended up telling jokes
and becoming rich and successful but always alone throughout it chapter 2 it becomes clear that Richie is a closeted gay
man in love with Eddie mostly this revelation becomes clear through two scenes the first is a flashback of Richie
hanging out at an arcade the same summer of the losers defeated Pennywise see the movies take place bit further ahead of
time than the book he plays street fighter with a boy he's had a crush on when the kid says he has to go Richie offers
to pay for the next round unfortunately his crush's cousin henry bowers lives to torment Richie and his friends now face
to face with a stab happy bully and surrounded by the judging eyes of his peers Richie's sexuality and therefore
masculinity is challenged by his crush Richie runs out of the arcade and seeks refuge in a public park before him stands
the symbol of masculinity a giant ax swinging paul bunyan looming 20 feet high in his flannel and denim he's a stark
contrast to Richie's blue and pink swirled button-up shirt the american folk hero instantly becomes a threat with
shredded teeth the second scene that reveals ritchie is queer doesn't happen until Eddie dies everyone is sad but Richie
is beside himself so overcome with emotion that he has to be hauled out of the sewer by his friends adult ritchie
doesn't seem to fit into a 2019 narrative not everyone can come out in america but Richie works as a comedian in los
angeles even if he chose to keep his sexuality close to the vest the idea that gay marriage and giant pride parades
could miss a white man working in hollywood doesn't make sense if it did highlighting that fact would be vital to
understanding the character the murky nature of Richie's queer identity feels like a letdown the second chapter of it
attempts to reveal the way dormant childhood trauma springs forth in adulthood anything buried will eventually rise to
the surface except for Richie's sexuality apparently the queer community is still struggling to be seen in cinema as
more than tragic romances or gay best friends the balance of the identity representation within the losers club offered
an awesome opportunity to detail the effects of the past 30 years on the most privileged members of the community but in
the film Richie a well-off white masculine gay man never even says that he's gay out loud not everything in it is coding
though very early on in the story we are shown the brutal gay bashing and violent murder of adrian mellon a murder so
heinous it wakes the titular it from its decades-long slumber king's language is harsh with characters using a vast
array of homophobic slurs in those early pages but those characters using them even the police are not celebrated the
author is very clearly judging them and it's this horrible violence so soon into the book that shows the darkness and
hate lurking under the surface of small town america it is the hate that's unnatural the hate that is evil not being
queer when we get into the head of don hagerty adrian's boyfriend and the author lets the reader know him he's
sympathetic he's smart and loving he also sees the town for what it is sees its evil clearly and wants to leave it
though the characters in the book don't empathize with him for having his boyfriend killed in front of him the author
does he shows the gay character as human in the midst of Reagan america the world's best-selling author was sending a
very blunt message Stephen King thought gay people should be able to date and hold hands and live their lives stephen
king did not think gay people should be tortured or killed he thought that those who would torture or kill gay people
were in the service of evil as were those who would tolerate it or look away the victims of homophobia did not deserve
to be victims homophobia Stephen King seemed to say is not the natural way of the world it is a monstrous thing and
those who practice it are a part of the monster like the Babadook *Hellraiser* jennifer's body the craft and king's own
carry the queer is not the monster something else is gay men lesbian women bisexual people transgender people everyone
under the queer umbrella we are not the monsters you are not the monster but the society that demonizes you that others
you that is the monster [Music] you
