In Hollywood's early years, homosexuality found its way on screen in ways both secret *and* obvious to the filmmakers behind the camera. Audiences *rarely* pushed back against these depictions, but those who *did* were loud, if not legion. Women's suffrage groups and the Catholic Church were the most dedicated to removing gay and lesbian content from Hollywood movies. 

And with the institution of the Motion Picture Production Code, they more or less succeeded. Filmmakers could now be fined or blacklisted for including gay and lesbian characters in their movies, and some films such as *Dracula's Daughter* were heavily edited to remove any overt lesbian content. But, go figure, a bunch of people who came up in the industry through artistic roots knew how to manipulate literary devices in visual language to still include gay themes and characters in their movies. Though in much less obvious ways.

Along with World War II and a coming end to what was referred to as the Golden Age of Hollywood, a time of gay invisibility had swept over the industry. But it was an invisibility that you *could see through*, if you knew how to look.

Even though Hollywood didn't always tell the truth, this kept a lot of unwelcome facts and small problems from getting in the way of the American Dream. Even though gay and lesbian people were often the ones who made these dreams come true, they were never a part of it. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It is said that Sam Goldwin, founder of Goldwyn Pictures, which was one of the three studios that merged to create MGM, once wanted to film *The Well of Loneliness* by Radcliffe Hall. But when a producer told him they couldn't because the main character was a lesbian, Goldwyn simply responded by saying:

> "So what? We'll make her American!"

Despite Goldwyn's confusing lesbian for Lebanese, the Americanization of lesbianism *did* happen, and meant nothing more than the simple *refusal* to deal with it honestly. It was an imitation of the American fear of sexuality in general and the American duplicity regarding sexual deviance in particular.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In all actuality, it was the same invisibility that gays experienced in *real* life, only replicated in the movies. Despite this gays continued to make an appearance as subtextual phantoms that represented the fear of homosexuality itself. They served as his alien life forms that were yet *firmly established* as part of the culture in every walk of life. And they formed the shadowy counterpart to the concept of the American dream.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Sissies and tomboys were used as yardsticks for what was deemed acceptable behavior in a culture that was so preoccupied with the upkeep of sex norms and the celebration of everything masculine. 

One performer who happily ignored these sex Norms was Greta Garbo, whose performance as Queen Christina in the film of the same name released in 1934, was a challenge to the standards of sexual and gender behavior that were considered acceptable at the time. It was the collision on screen of her own androgynous aesthetic, with the reality of Christina's affinity for masculine clothes and activities, that gave the picture a realism that was uniquely its own.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Garbo — who would express her desire to be in a film version of Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, with herself in the title role in Marilyn Monroe as a young girl ruined by Dorian — created a particular dynamic in *Queen Christina*, one that penetrated the queer erasure of the script. Her forlorn longings to escape her gloomy destiny of marriage and her skillful rejection of a series of male suitors are broken in the first part of the film by her encounter with the Countess Eba Spar, played by a Elizabeth Young. 

Their brief scene together is charged with sexuality and real affection. in that scene, Garbo lifts the emotional barriers to characterize her encounters with mail suitors. Abba suggests brightly that they go for a sleigh ride, but Christina tells her sadly:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.queen_christina %}>

Christina: "I can't now."

Abba: "Oh why not?"

Christina: "Ambassadors, treaties, councils..."

Abba: "How boring!"

</clip>

Later, when pressed by a statesman to marry and produce an heir to the throne, Christina refuses.

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.queen_christina %}>

Chancellor: "But your majesty! You cannot die an Old Maid!"

Christina: (stops, spins) "I have no intention to, Chancellor. I shall die a bachelor!" (turns and leaves)

</clip>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Her need to escape the role assigned her by life was Christina's true driving passion. *Queen Christina* makes this abundantly clear. She flees into the snow later in the film when she discovers that ebispower has betrayed her love. *That* is when she meets Antonio, the one man who seems to accept her and *love* her for all the things that so horrify her court. But he falls in love with her, thinking *at first* that she's a man. And he seems quite willing to explore whatever this strange situation may bring.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In the early days of Hollywood, *Queen Christina* stood out due to the fact that it included a character that was unmistakably bisexual. As well as many instances of bisexuality in the narrative of the film itself. 

At the time, the lives of notable gay men and lesbians were either portrayed in a manner that was drastically different from their actual experiences, or were not addressed at all in biographical films. This straight-washing of history has only *marginally* changed in modern cinema, as seen by the fact that films such as *Troy*, *A Beautiful Mind*, and *The Imitation Game* more or less ignore or completely *erase* the fact that its primary characters are gay or bisexual.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's one of the reasons why audience members were taken aback by the lesbian relationships that were depicted in *The Favorite*. Even in the late 2010s, audiences of historical biopics *anticipated* that queerness would be erased from historical recreations. 

The portrayal of noted persons as heterosexual, without regard for their true to life sexuality, has never been seen as a serious offense against a person's identity until recently. Not even by the person whose life is falsified. No, it was better to be straight. Even queer audiences themselves believe that, especially in Hollywood's Golden Age, when it was a dirty secret most people yearned to be rid of. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But there was an odd dichotomy developing in Hollywood, whereas lesbian or bisexual female characters could be *redeemed* in a film by being paired off with the right man in the end, bisexual or gay *male* characters had no such luxury. In the film *Adam's Rib*, which was released in 1949, David Wayne plays the role of Kip, who is a yardstick par excellence. 

Kip serves as Katherine Hepburn's... girlfriend. Acting as a high-class Ethel Mertz to her feminist Lucy Ricardo. Despite Catherine Hepburn's defense, Spencer Tracy's apparent *unease* around him cannot be denied. As they were leaving the room following a heated discussion over feminism, Wayne said to Hepburn:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.adams_rib %}>

Wayne: "You've got me so convinced, I may even go out and become a woman."

\[clip continues]

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

When Wayne has gone, Spencer Tracy mutters...

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.adams_rib %}>

\[clip continues]

Spencer Tracy: "And he wouldn't have far to go either."

Hepburn: (shushes him)

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Hepburn's Amanda can only shush him, an indication that her *feminism*, like that of contemporary feminists who wanted their sons to grow up to be real men, goes only so far and breaks down at the thought of actually obscuring sex and gender roles altogether. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yet the unyielding conviction in the masculine role, along with the hatred that this ideology bred, was about to be shaken to its very foundation. 

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">The buddy system that had been used during the second world war had brought troops closer together than they had ever been before. Men who loved each other's company, but always selected women to display their manhood, were forced to confront their innate sexuality in the all-male atmosphere of military forces. This brought to the surface a misunderstanding regarding men's fundamental sexuality. The worry that these heterosexual relationships between men, may in any way be interpreted as being gay, was a very genuine one.</span>

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And the movies made sure that there was *no indication* of homosexuality involved in depictions of such partnerships. There might have been less suspicion of homosexuality had the level of paranoia surrounding its very *mention* not been so high. 

In 1946, Richard Brooks's novel *The Brick Foxhole* dealt with obsessive masculinity in the military. In it, a gay decorator is murdered by a soldier he brings home to his apartment for a drink. The 1947 film adaptation *Crossfire* made the victim a Jewish person. And thus became an example of Hollywood's maturity in dealing with anti-Semitism. The New York Times noted the change in a review but said only that the motivation for the murder had been changed "to good advantage". The novel's crucial discussion of men striking out at what they fear in themselves was omitted. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Whenever all-male circumstances were the topic of the movies, whether they were cowboys, sports, or soldiers, the fantasy of the unfettered perennially youthful man in pure and unsullied brotherhood battled over the ever-present societal *taboo* against male closeness. 

Director Clarence Brown toyed with this in his film *Flesh And The Devil*, in which John Gilbert and Lars Hansen play lifelong friends who separate when one of them marries the woman they both love, played by Greta Garbo. By the end of the film, Garbo has slept with both of them, precipitating a reluctant duel between the two men. Trying to stop them, she falls through some thin ice and drowns. At this the men throw down their guns, embrace, and walk off into the sunset together, their arms around each other. Their bond rejoined following the *intrusion* of a woman.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Clarence Brown spoke of the situation in an interview:

> "You can see my problem!
>
> How to have these two leading men wind up in each other's arms and not make them look like a couple of fairies?"

Joan Mellon, in her study of masculinity in the movies *Big Bad Wolves*, says that the less violent men were in their film personas, the more likely they were to be interested in heterosexual love. Just the opposite has been true for homoeroticism.

<from></from>

The perception of homosexual feelings as a brutal furtive dangerous force flourished in films about male bonding and violence, playing off of the idea of homosexuality being innately criminal. Gentlemen in the movies, Jimmy Stewart, and any movie about Small Town USA, would never even *subtextually* approach such relationships or feelings. The concept of the gentleman who chooses to love other men did not exist in American Film *except* in comedy.

In the films of Laurel and Hardy, their relationship was given a sweet and very real, loving dimension. A classic example of this, one with *unmistakably* gay overtones, is 1932's *Their First Mistake*. Hardy's wife complains that he sees too much of Laurel and not enough of her. And the two friends discussed the situation:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.first_mistake %}>

Laurel: "But what's the matter with her anyway?" 

Hardy: "Oh, I don't know. She says that I think more of you than I do of her."

Laurel: "Well, you do, don't ya?"

Hardy: "Well, we won't go into that."

-----

Laurel: "You know what the whole trouble is?"

Hardy: "What?"

Laurel: "What you need is a baby in your house."

Hardy: "Well what's that got to do with it?"

Laurel: "Well, if you've if you had a baby and... it would keep your wife's mind occupied... and you could go out nights with me and she'd never think anything about it."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So they go out and adopt a baby. When they return home with it, they discover that Hardy's wife is suing him for divorce for alienation of affections, having named *Laurel* as the other woman. The remainder of the film is a beautifully timed and performed domestic scene with Laurel and Hardy in bed with the baby between them.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The obviousness of the coding has been lambasted *ever since* the film's release, with Charles Barr in his study of Laurel and Hardy saying that:

> "There is something rather absurd about discussing this seriously at all. In the often infantile, pre-sexual nursery world in which Stan and Ollie lived, such behavior would be natural."

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I'd agree that it is in fact natural, but the idea of there ever having been a "pre-sexual time" is reaching. But notice that it is the "naturalness" of Laurel and Hardy's behavior that Barr and other critics choose to defend, not the sexuality. And so it is, indeed, an attack on Americanism itself to suggest that homosexuality is present in the Laurel and Heardy routines.

In pointing these things out, one attacks the "American illusion", the illusion that there is in fact such a thing as a "real man" and that to become one is as easy as changing one's name from Marion Morrison to John Wayne. The fact is that comedy has been able to comment on sexual roles more readily than drama could, only because people may dismiss it as an impossible farce.

Neglected sissy-buddy relationships exist even in classic cartoons. Walt Disney may not have liked hearing it, but there are gay overtones in the relationships of more than one pair of beloved animated figures from his classic years. In 1940's *Pinocchio*, Honest John and Gideon, a fox and a cat, are best friends who procure lost boys for sale to an evil coachman who takes them to Pleasure Island. They seduce Pinocchio with the hit song High Diddly D, the second line of which is "high diddly day, an actor's life is gay".

In Cinderella, everyone's favorite mice Jaq and Gus Gus, volunteer to help finish Cinderella's dress in time for the ball. But they are quickly admonished by a female mouse to "leave the sowing to the women". Their relationship grows throughout the film, and later when Cinderella describes how she was swept off her feet by the handsome prince, Gus Gus puts an arm around Jaq's shoulder and holds him close. 

And of course, from the competition, there was Bugs Bunny, giddy to throw on a dress and a wig at the first available opportunity.

The real emotions in the movies at the time with exceptions for films like *Gone With the Wind* always took place between men. Men had been the important forces at work, both as instigators of all the action and plots and as instigators of the films themselves, by deciding what movies should and should not be made. 

When screenwriter Gore Vidal discussed the script for the 1959 version of *Ben-Hur* with director William Weiler, they concluded that the rivalry between Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and his boyfriend Masala (Stephen Boyd) was insufficiently motivated by a single political scene in which Ben-Hur refuses to Aid the Roman cause, despite his friend's pleas. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Vidal described the problem:

> "I proposed the notion that the two had been adolescent lovers and now Masala has returned from Rome wanting to revive the love affair but Ben-Hur is not. He has read Leviticus and knows an abomination when he sees one.  
> I told Wyler...
>
> 'This is what's going on underneath the scene — they seem to be talking about politics, but Masala is really trying to rekindle a love affair,' and Wyler was startled. We discussed the matter, and then he sighed, "Well. Anything is better than what we've got in the way of motivation, but don't tell Chuck.'
>
> I did tell Stephen Boyd, who was fascinated. He agreed to play the frustrated lover. Study his face in the reaction shots in that scene, and you will see that he plays it like a man starving."

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It was 1959, and filmmakers were on the verge of new creative freedoms. Vidal was saying that it made sense that the two men *should* be attracted to each other. Theirs was the most vibrant and interesting relationship in the film. Wyler later told Vidal:

> "The biggest mistake we made was the (straight) love story. If we had cut out the girl all together and concentrated on the two guys, everything would have gone better."

Director Howard Hawks *always* concentrated on men in his films. And in his films, things went better. [Chuckles] Better than in Ben-Hur. at least.

<span visual=none on="?">In 1948's *Red River*, Hawks' only use for Joe Andrew was to have her tell John Wayne and Montgomery Clift what we can *already see*:</span>

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.red_river %}>

Andrew: "What a fool I've been. Expected trouble for days when..." (sniff) "when anybody would half a mind would know you two love each other."

<span visual=none off="?">Yet the nature of that love, despite Cliff's scene persona doing for *his* character what Garbo did for Queen Christina, remained hidden. Despite one of the most re-watched, and arguably most homoerotic scenes in any film at the time, being one in which Montgomery Clift and John Ireland compare their...</span> pistols.

The only open acknowledgment of the homosexuality in buddy films came from those critics who attributed the misogynist attitudes of such films to the covert gayness in them. When Joseph McBride and Gerald Perry, in an interview in film comment, questioned Hawks about the gay undertones of his films, *Red River* in particular, Hawks told them it was a goddamn silly statement to make.

<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's easy to see how directors might be... oblivious to the subtexts that are present in their own work, since homosexuality as a viable alternative has been repressed both in the lives of men *and* in their work. On screen, the taboo against male closeness is taken *far* more seriously than it is in real life, where it is more likely to be seen as a "neutral gay sensibility". 

Some people contend that there is no such thing as a "gay sensibility", since the presence of such a thing would imply the existence of a "straight sensibility", which is something that unquestionably *does not* exist. Yet a gay sensibility can take on various forms and it is possible for it to be present, even when there *is* no indication of homosexuality, either overt or covert, in front of or behind the camera. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The need to conceal one's sexual orientation for such a significant portion of one's life is primarily responsible for the development *of* a gay sensibility. It is a ghetto sensibility that was developed *out of the necessity* to cultivate and employ a second sight, that would interpret *discreetly* what the world sees and what the actual reality may be. 

It was gay sensibility that, for example, often enabled some lesbians and gay men, to see at very early ages, even before they knew the words for what they were, something on the screen that they knew related to their lives in some way. Often it was the simple recognition of difference. The sudden understanding that something was altered or not what it should be. Perhaps the role reversal of a Dietrich or a Garbo evoking a hidden truth about the nature of sexuality in general. Or it may have been the tone in James Dean's voice as he zipped up the jacket of the dead Zel Mineo in *Rebel Without a Cause* and muttered:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips. %}>

Dean: "He's always cold..."

</clip>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It was the sense of yearning that was there in these encounters. The unsaid forbidden desires that were always there, but were always repressed. Even if the parts did not fit together until years later, it was a voice that could not be ignored. With no *real* homosexuals allowed on screen in the 40s and 50s, censors often began looking for these hidden messages. Sometimes they found them even when there were *real* things that were abundantly clear. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In the film *Rope* for instance, directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1948, Farley Granger and John Dahl play the role of two pretentious gay lovers who, on a whim, murder a former Prep School classmate. They do this because they believe they possess a superior intellect and are not morally responsible to a crass society. The censor's attention was drawn not to the exact relationship between the characters, but rather to the discourse between them.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Arthur Lawrence recalls that when he finished his screenplay for "Rope", he left England for America. And while he was in America, the script was passed on by American censors.

> "Rope came from an English play called 'Rope's End,' and while I was in New York, the producer Sydney Bernstein took a few passages from the play and put them back in the script. So when it came back from the Hayes Office, every one of those passages was circled, with the comment 'homosexual dialogue' written in the margin.
>
> And do you know what they were?
>
> It was simply that they were saying things like 'My dear boy' to each other, and the way that the English talked was known as 'fruity' over here."

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's actually a long-held myth within film circles that the reason Hitchcock filmed *Rope* to appear as one long unedited take was so that censors would be unable to force him to cut any perceived gay content without altering the artistic intent of the film. 

</james>
<from></from>

There were also other more covert homosexual relationships in Hitchcock films, such as the one between Martin Landau and James Mason in *North by Northwest*, and more strikingly the one between Robert Walker and Farley Granger in *Strangers On A Train*. Nonetheless the filmmaker only *seldom* offered commentary on matters of this nature regarding his work. But Arthur Lawrence later said:

> "We never discussed, Hitch and I, whether the characters in Rope were homosexuals, but I thought it was apparent. I guess he did, too, but it never came up until we got to casting.
>
> We'd wanted Cary Grant for the teacher and Montgomery Clift for one of the boys, and they both turned it down for the same reason — their image.
> They felt they couldn't risk it.
>
> Eventually John Dall and Farley Granger played the boys, and they were very aware of what they were doing."

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

He also stated that Robert Walker was the one who suggested playing Bruno Anthony as a gay character in the film *Strangers On A Train*. The strangeness of their agreement was emphasized by the friction that it caused between his malignantly faye Bruno and Granger's golly gee tennis player Guy Haynes.

In compensation for the death of Bruno's despised father, Guy agreed to take the life of Bruno's undesirable wife and put an end to Guy's marriage. Bruno's homosexuality emerged in phrases that would be used *progressively* during the 50s to describe gays as aliens. Because of his icy demeanor, his dark imagination, and the elitist superiority that he exuded, he was an extension of the clever but lethal sissy archetype. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Philip and Brandon, the lovers in *Rope*, were warped individuals who murdered out of a belief in their own moral and intellectual superiority. Which they believed placed them outside the law. By existing outside the culture, such gays were able to deny *explicit* homosexuality while at the *same time* reinforcing specific stereotypes. 

This is how Oscar Wilde's *The Picture Of Dorian Gray* could reach the screen in 1945, shorn of its more bizarre sexual implications, while offering George Saunders as a symbol of sophisticated decadence. Such ghettoized characters pre-saged the gay-as-alien images of the 1950s, and had their roots in the same anti-intellectualism and mistrust of difference that had characterized the shaping of Hollywood's image of the "normal" American man.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The view of the homosexual as being alien to his own society was also present in the constant *deletion* of specific homosexuality from the screen adaptations of literary works. In 1945, Billy Wilder brought Charles Jackson's novel *The Lost Weekend* to the screen with Ray Milland as the alcoholic writer Don Burnham. In Jackson's novel, Burnham's alcoholism stems from a complex variety of reasons that include a father fixation and a false accusation of his having had a gay relationship with a college frat brother. In Wilder's version of *The Lost Weekend*, however, the motivation for Burnham's drinking becomes a simple case of writer's block.

The only frames of reference for the majority of gay people were these covert signals and hidden indicators of homosexuality in Hollywood movies. The majority of gay people learned about themselves mostly through movies that stated the rest of the world was straight. A documentary entitled *Word Is Out* which was released in 1977 demonstrated that the majority of gay people living in the United States had the misconception that they were the only ones like them in the entire world.

Several years later when the Supreme Court finally ruled that it wasn't obscene to portray homosexual content on screen, films that were more overtly gay helped pave the way for the legitimization of homosexual subject matter on screen. Nonetheless throughout the early and middle part of the 1950s, the invisibility of homosexuality was enforced with an almost *fanatical* paranoia. The perversity of the outsider, the oddball, or the alien screen character, was very noticeable... in an era built around rigid conformity such as the 1950s. The equation between being different in any way... and being gay was easy to see.

In 1952's *My Son, John*, Dean Jagger and Helen Hayes played the distraught parents of a young man who is... well, not *gay* but a communist agent played by Robert Walker. When their suspicions about their son's activities are confirmed, it's an American Tragedy. Suddenly they see their son as shifty and unfamiliar, a *thing* with no respect for God or country. An unprincipled monster to whom they can no longer relate. The healthy family disappears. Walker's coldness, his superiority, and his open contempt for his parents and their way of life, conspire to create a perverse unnaturalness.

In a 1950 New York Times story, The Republican National committee chairman asserted that:

> "Sexual perverts who have infiltrated our government in recent years are perhaps as dangerous as actual Communists."

By December of that year 4,954 *suspected* homosexuals had been removed from employment in the federal government. The Lavender Scare was gripping Washington, and with the help of a future president, would soon dig its claws deep into Hollywood as well.
