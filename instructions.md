# How to read this site

This site is meant as both a reference and a fact checking site. The purpose of this site is for people who are perhaps looking for something that James has said that you've maybe internalized and now question whether it is true. It's meant for people who want to make sure all the plagiarism James did is caught and documented. And if you really want to, you can use it as an aid while watching James's videos.

If you'd like to help with anything, feel free to [submit an issue with any new sources](https://github.com/tustin2121/James_Somerton_Transcripts/issues) or [submit a pull request with any code changes](https://github.com/tustin2121/James_Somerton_Transcripts/pulls). You might also want to join the [Former Fans discord server](https://discord.gg/PVXTAeVZHE) where we're discussing this stuff in #general-plagiarism.

You'll often find that <mark num=1>sometimes</mark> <mark num=3>the plagiarism is obvious</mark>, but that <mark num=2>things have been reworded or reordered</mark>. James often does this to <mark num=5>try</mark> and <mark num=4>hide</mark> his plagiarism more. Note that each <mark num=7>highlighted phrase</mark> has a <mark num=6>little number at the front of</mark> it in superscript.

Sometimes correctsions<sup class="add">[sic: corrections]</sup> for spelling or wording will be called out with superscript. Other times there may be <del>corrections</del><ins>word changes</ins> like this to indicate when the captions from the video don't line up with what's spoken. Both of these will usually only happen with certain videos which have had their scripts uploaded as captions.

The text in the right-side source boxes is here for comparison only. I will be sure to give page or paragraph where you can read the original. You can click the blue link in the top-right corner to jump to the APA-style citation for this text, and from there I will try to always include a link to where you can read it yourself. (You may have to sign up for archive.org to borrow a book, but usually James copied from easily accessible material that wasn't behind a paywall).

I don't want to deprive the authors any more than James did, but I do want to be able to include context to show how James usually ripped off and mutilated these authors' ideas. I believe this to be fair use and properly cited.

However, if you are one of the plagiarized authors and would like the text of your work to be taken down from this site, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/tustin2121/James_Somerton_Transcripts/issues) and I will gladly clear out the right side boxes.

<u>[On screen]: I will call out when something relevant is shown on-screen.</u>

Usually, James will show and read out quotes--

<u>[Scrolling on screen]:</u>
> "In full screen, which I will try and match the formatting, style, and punctuation of, even if that means sometimes having to correct <del>a thing</del><ins>something</ins> James mispronounces."

Other times, <q>words may appear on screen</q> floating next to James's head, which he will then <q>read out loud anyway</q> as if to highlight the words.

Sometimes James will just make up something which is <mark fc=false>perfectly true, honest! Go look it up!</mark>

</james>
<comment>
{% include header for=tustin %}

In which case, there will be a comment, usually linking off to [some source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source) with the factual information to correct the misinformation.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Sometimes James does actually <mark fc=true>correct things</mark> from the sources he's plagiarizing from.

It's rare, but it has been shown to happen.

I will be cutting out any links to James's socials, as well as any sponsor spots he did in the video. He doesn't need the publicity.

I will also be cutting any names of former patrons, because it's not our fault we were duped. (I'm a former patron, and this site is basically how I'm getting my feelings about it out.)

Let me tell you about the sponsor of this video:

Some videos are podcast episodes, where James and Nick will banter back and forth about things.

</james>
<nick>

They will be formatted like this, with their back and forth more visually shown.

And of course, fact checking will happen on the right here, as usual.

They may sometimes interrupt one another, and where it's possible to hear, I'll make sure to include what was said in the cross-talk.

</james>
<nick crosstalk>

They may--

<nick>

Yeah, and, um-- I'm-- I'm gonna try and cut out, um... some... some of the ums and repetition that... that comes from unscripted content like this. Just to, you know, be easier on the eyes. No promises though.

Sometimes, there will be transcripts with stolen visuals from other documentaries or youtube creators.

<span visual=3 on="3:12" off="3:31">Parts which have footage from another video will be marked with a highlight bar between the two columns. The numbers in the middle bar highlights are the start and end timestamps in the original video.</span> The highlight is positioned to roughly match up in the left-side transcript with when in the video the stolen footage is shown. (You'll need Javascript turned on to see these highlights.)

This can even be separate from what is being said in the video, so textual plagiarism will still be called out on the right.
